<PRE>Hi Ryan,

I agree with you on most counts,

- inflation is unlikely because despite the money creation, it can't keep up
with the credit and wealth destruction that has taken place

- a long slow malaise, like Japan, is likely,

and this for the same reason: the U.S. government has chosen the same zombie
bank strategy, which keeps the patient on life support, but doesn't heal any
of the underlying causes .. over-indebted households, corporations, and
governments are in such need to be deleveraged that artificial credit
creation only compounds the problem ...

However, I would not be confident that crisis moments would remain abstent
(which doesn't mean total and immediate collapse)

But all of this seriously hampers a reconfiguration needed for Kondratieff
5,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very interesting link.  Much of it I disagree with, but much is, I think,
</I>&gt;<i> spot on, but it misses the big picture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been following the supply push inflation argument for some time (as
</I>&gt;<i> one sees in this article).  So far, there is no sign it is true...or little
</I>&gt;<i> sign.  States can quite happily leave interest rates low AND print money.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think the reasons for this are two-fold:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The world would literally collapse if credit stopped flowing.  Collapse
</I>&gt;<i> is something so terrible to comprehend that no one who has any serious power
</I>&gt;<i> wants it.  Credit is the life-blood of the present...not capital.  The
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental equation of capitalism was...I can find projects by being clever
</I>&gt;<i> that merit my borrowing funds with a high likelihood of pay-back of risk
</I>&gt;<i> capital.  Sadly, there are few projects during this recession that can
</I>&gt;<i> justify debt even at low costs.  Thus, interest rates cannot climb...no
</I>&gt;<i> matter how much cash supply flows in the economy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Governments, long the source of Keynesian uptake of surplus credit have
</I>&gt;<i> over-extended themselves trying to bribe the public with get goods now pay
</I>&gt;<i> later schemes. Thus, no one wants to lend them money and they will not pay
</I>&gt;<i> higher prices to borrow...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No one really knows the outcome of this because it has never happened
</I>&gt;<i> before.  Anyone who says otherwise, I assure you, is ill-informed.  We are
</I>&gt;<i> simply in a new place economically.  It is &quot;peak leverage.&quot;  It isn't that
</I>&gt;<i> we don't have more money to lend...it is that no one has the capacity to
</I>&gt;<i> borrow.  So supply push inflation is not likely...despite what the article
</I>&gt;<i> suggests.  I also think collapse is unlikely...because as soon as an
</I>&gt;<i> capacity emerges, it will again be leveraged...especially by governments
</I>&gt;<i> which cannot exist without bribing voters.  In the old days, monarchs would
</I>&gt;<i> simply hammer the poor.  Today, the poor tend to vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is broadly assumed that either the governments or the private sector
</I>&gt;<i> must de-lever (reduce their debt loads).  The trouble is, the private sector
</I>&gt;<i> de-levers by having jobs and high incomes.  Right now, there are few
</I>&gt;<i> projects that merit investment so there are few that can generate cash flows
</I>&gt;<i> for high-wage jobs.  Governments cannot de-lever without raising
</I>&gt;<i> taxes...which makes the situation even worse on those trying to gain some
</I>&gt;<i> traction against their own personal debt loads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, the perfect storm exists of governments being deeply in debt,
</I>&gt;<i> individuals being deeply in debt and projects being few for creating growth
</I>&gt;<i> (that is, there are no ideas so compelling people want them regardless, so
</I>&gt;<i> they will take even more risk...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no simple way out of this but that does not imply collapse.  It
</I>&gt;<i> probably implies slow down...a general malaise lasting a generation or
</I>&gt;<i> more.  That is neither the answer that go-go capitalists or revolutionary
</I>&gt;<i> socialists want, but it is the probably reality.  Thus, for those in
</I>&gt;<i> relatively OK shape...in short, the wealthy, they are hunkering down,
</I>&gt;<i> conserving and trying to last out the storm...which may go on for a
</I>&gt;<i> generation or two.  Meanwhile technology advances...even accelerates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own personal view is that there is no way out of this problem without
</I>&gt;<i> radical improvements in technology that effectively change the game.  In
</I>&gt;<i> short, the old system hasn't died, but it is so sick and will be so for so
</I>&gt;<i> long, that it cannot be relied upon.  Thus, both the left and right are
</I>&gt;<i> contemplating what could serve as the new normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the US the right is trying to gain time...blocking any change at all
</I>&gt;<i> until they can come up with a feasible strategy for preserving wealth and
</I>&gt;<i> the political status quo.  I am fairly confident no such outcome exists...so
</I>&gt;<i> really, they are in a  long death strategy...call it aging gracefully.  The
</I>&gt;<i> left lacks the compelling political message to motivate large numbers who
</I>&gt;<i> are, frankly, terrified of the abyss they see swallowing more and more of
</I>&gt;<i> their friends.  The left is equally in survival mode trying to get basic
</I>&gt;<i> services for those who have been destroyed by the slow-down.  Easy money for
</I>&gt;<i> the unskilled is gone.  Skills are getting vastly more complex rapidly...a
</I>&gt;<i> few at the bottom of the ladder can keep up.  This will fuel growth for the
</I>&gt;<i> marginal left, local greens, etc. but it won't matter much in the grand
</I>&gt;<i> scheme.  Politically it might matter...especially in Europe...but Europe is
</I>&gt;<i> becoming peripheral...not so much economically, but in terms of social power
</I>&gt;<i> and influence.  Colonialism is finally dying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only (good) answer is technology movements that shift the game.  I
</I>&gt;<i> simply see no other feasible answer that arises in less than 20 years.  On
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand, I for one believe the probabilities are very very high
</I>&gt;<i> (above 0.7) that technology does come up with game shifting advances
</I>&gt;<i> relatively soon.   And now that we have the internet, these will be known
</I>&gt;<i> almost instantly...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, that's my way of viewing it...always interested in others...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ryan
