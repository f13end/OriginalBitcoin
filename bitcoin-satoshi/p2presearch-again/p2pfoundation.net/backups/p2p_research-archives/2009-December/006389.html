&gt;<i> agreed. One of the things I hope to cover in a &quot;digital awareness&quot;

</I>
At the very least, they should avoid aggregating all those
services with one vendor, however convenient that may be.
 
&gt;<i> And the same applies to email, calendaring, etc
</I>
Email yes, though there are advantages in a platform that has
many users (calendar sharing). There are currently no easy
ways to seamlessly to aggregate and integrate individual
feeds. This is something which can and should be fixed.
 
&gt;<i> This said, it's not free, because to do things well you need to rent a
</I>&gt;<i> Virtual Private Server in some professional data center, which means
</I>&gt;<i> several Euro (&gt;= 10/15) each month, so it's simply out of reach for
</I>
If you have a dedicated system at home it will cost you about that
much in term of electricity costs. Of course nowadays we have embedded
systems which take 5-10 W and can do most of the work required.
These can be easily findable using services like DynDNS or using
IPv6 tunnels.

VServers of course come with a highly available low-latency connection
and a static IP (or IPv6 subnet), and are very efficient energetically.

&gt;<i> many people, especially because this is something every individual
</I>&gt;<i> should do by him/herself.
</I>
Well, there are some enduser products becoming available, e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.pogoplug.com/">http://www.pogoplug.com/</A>

Of course here you're relying on a company again, though that needs
not to be that way in principle.
 
&gt;<i> And it's not trivial at all. More exactly, it is trivial for somebody
</I>&gt;<i> who already has the right basic skills, knowledge and attitude for
</I>&gt;<i> messing with command line installation and configuration of server
</I>&gt;<i> software. But that is just what, 3/4% of people?
</I>
I see this more as a business opportunity. If 1-5% of all customers
are interested in securely hosting their own storage and applications 
at home in a trusted environment provided it's trivial to setup that is a
considerable market. Drobo and PogoPlug are catering to that.
 
&gt;<i> For all the others (*), software is still equivalent to terribly
</I>&gt;<i> complicated black magic: if you can't avoid it you use it, but don't
</I>&gt;<i> even try to understand it, you don't dare alter the spells others told
</I>&gt;<i> you to repeat and you couldn't imagine anything less productive, or
</I>&gt;<i> more boring/dangerous, than reading the instruction manual for those
</I>&gt;<i> spells.
</I>
Try setting up a Pogo Plug, just for shits and giggles. 
 
&gt;<i> This does not mean that that 3/4% of people are better or superior to
</I>&gt;<i> all the others in any way, of course. I run my own mail server but am
</I>&gt;<i> completely helpless in other areas. It only means that we're all
</I>&gt;<i> different, and it would be counterproductive to forget it.
</I>
What I am missing is awareness in those potential 1-5% target that
they're having a particular problem, and that problem can be solved
painlessly with the right kind of appliance, or commercial service
which is not concentrated, and doesn't try to lock you in.
 
&gt;<i> I plan to write a piece on some of the social impacts of this by the
</I>&gt;<i> end of the month, will post here the link when done.

</I>&gt;<i> (*) and this includes most people who are advanced MS Office or
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOffice users, run a blog at blogspot.com, wordpress.com and
</I>&gt;<i> similar, or spend their day in Facebook, Twitter and other social
</I>&gt;<i> networks.
