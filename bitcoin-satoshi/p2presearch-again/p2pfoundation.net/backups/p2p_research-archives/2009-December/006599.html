It is definitely heartening that this has not happened yet.
The Curve of Binding Energy is from 1973. If anything, it is
much easier now, some 40 years hence. How our cities and
society would look like in times of high-frequency asymmetric
nuclear warfare is probably none of us is particularly keen
to experience.

I don't know who is doing what and why, but you'll have to agree
that in terms of ROI a few kT in a major high-density location
are extremely well invested.

If you cannot increase the rate of body bag shipments (or, better
alive but maimed bodies) only way to demoralize left is to carry mayhem 
back to soft heartland of the agressor.

The current generation is not really autonomous either.

Encryption is incredibly cheap in terms of logic real estate or CPU cycles.

That, too. Money has nearly run out now, though.
