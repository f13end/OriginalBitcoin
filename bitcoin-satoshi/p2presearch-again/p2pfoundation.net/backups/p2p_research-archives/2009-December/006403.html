You can't. Neither a corporate nor a government entity can be trusted.
You can trust other end users a lot more if safeguarded against
snooping and tampering precisely because their capabilities do
not differ markedly from your own. Cryptography is a key way to achieve that.
Cryptography is also a key technology to keep track of trust and reputation.

Paranoia is the wrong term, since we do not have to guess under

</I>
The first time I've run into security problems in regards to military
cryptography and was disciplined for it was 1988. Since then, I very
much doubt my profile has gotten any less conspicuous. Or so a little
bird told me a few years ago. 
 
&gt;<i> The fact is, any ISP can log and decrypt all the data anyone sends through 
</I>&gt;<i> it from a specific location if they really want to. One can assume the

</I>&gt;<i> keep stuff private now, but would it keep it private ten years from now 
</I>&gt;<i> with decryption computers 1000 times faster or cheaper (Moore's law) than 
</I>&gt;<i> what we have now?
</I>
Not my threat model. You're wrong about systems getting faster, this is 
not what cooks your goose. Without advances in cryptoattacks faster hardware
is meaningless. 
 
&gt;<i> Let's say someone unintentionally but illegally downloads just *one*

Let's say you're organizing a strike or a demonstration today. Of what

keys are ephemeral) break a given OpenVPN session log two decades hence?

</I>&gt;<i> It may depend on the interpretation of the &quot;statute of limitations&quot; as well

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;probable cause&quot; to investigate further in the then present day (2020) by

I'm missing the part where they traced his Tor session and cracked his 
Truecrypt system partition which was secured by a strong passphrase.

Oh wait, because that never happened. He unwittingly ran into a honeypot, 
and submitted to have his unhardened machine to be analyzed forensically, 
then pleaded guilty in a fishy bargain in a modern equivalent of a Malleus 
maleficarum case.
 
&gt;<i> After September 11, 2001, examining cell phone calls was a big thing -- 
</I>&gt;<i> showing how they are routinely recorded (a fact not widely know at the 
</I>&gt;<i> time, but obvious after).
</I>
Much more interestingly is that in many countries service providers
must log your location info with time (which is a movement profile)
and record connection info. Plans to log your complete online trail
are in the works, at least in UK. Plans to only allow going online 
when authenticated with personal ID smartcards ditto. One wonders 
what plans are in the drawers we haven't heard about yet.
 
&gt;<i> Even now people are working to crack GSM phone encryption. Related:
</I>
GSM &quot;encryption&quot; was deliberately designed to be weak. Realtime
GSM cracks are over a decade old now. Try the same with another
cryptosystem considered deprecated, such as 3DES. Not so easy now, eh.

&gt;<i> &quot;Open Source Attempt To Crack GSM Encryption&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The intended approach is to create an open source project to spread the 
</I>&gt;<i> computation of a giant look-up table across more than 80 machines. 
</I>&gt;<i> Interestingly, they've openly stated that nVidia's CUDA technology will be 
</I>&gt;<i> used to execute parallel elements of the problem on GPUs as well.&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, for anyone who archives all encrypted phone communications around them 
</I>&gt;<i> (would take a lot of storage space obviously), they would be able in ten 
</I>&gt;<i> years or so probably to listen to everything anyone around them said now on 
</I>
Not my SIP session over OpenVPN they won't.

&gt;<i> a cellular phone; recording even encrypted conversations may be illegal for 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals, but I would expect at least any government would find out some 
</I>&gt;<i> way to justify it. Certainly a foreign government could probably record 
</I>&gt;<i> cell phone calls in the USA, decrypt them, and then pass the data back to 
</I>&gt;<i> the US under various agreements.
</I>
You're describing an existing arrangement.
 
&gt;<i> So, while encryption may be useful in delaying people's access to your 
</I>&gt;<i> communications, don't assume it does any more than *delay* access.
</I>
It depends on your threat model. For most cases you're wrong.
 
&gt;<i> And it also won't delay access under certain legal situations in some 
</I>&gt;<i> countries:
</I>
Now you know why I no longer travel to UK.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> So, I suggest we should assume everything we do is monitored and everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> on this p2p list works for the CIA. Now what? :-) Well, one can start 
</I>
That is not a very useful assumption. A much better assumption that
everything in cleartext passes through tapping points which can do
nontrivial filtering, and can destil down interesting traffic for further
scrutiny and possible storage, including human analyst eye time.

Already trivial encryption will very effectively disrupt this
large scale passive scrutiny of cleartext. Active MITM takes a lot
more sophistication and can be detected in principle, so it can't
be done on a wide scale. 

&gt;<i> working to change the nature of society in a peaceful, non-violent, and 
</I>&gt;<i> legal way that works for everyone using P2P and other technologies. :-) And 
</I>
If you think it will be peaceful, legal and non-violent you're bullshitting
yourself. The current developments are not sustainable. Either the current
trend will reverse, or we'll see considerable mayhem ahead. (We already know
that the current national administrations are deploying this technology to 
early identify and isolate trouble hot spots -- any trouble hot spots).

&gt;<i> one could also work peacefully and legally to changing the laws about

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we seem way past that infocalypse already in some ways, like the guy 
</I>&gt;<i> above arrested for a model rocket still in the package. In a way, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;think of the children&quot; Infocalypse (like is putting that 22 year old in

</I>&gt;<i> on the other side (everything logged, broad and vague laws on all sorts of

</I>&gt;<i> enforcement of that, children being imprisoned for their own &quot;protection&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> for sending pictures of themselves, a generated climate of fear and 
</I>&gt;<i> mistrust, etc.).
</I>
Precisely. So what are you doing about it?
 
&gt;<i> Still, even assuming the worst, we can work towards something better with 
</I>&gt;<i> what we have, our imaginations, our community, our technology, and so on. 
</I>&gt;<i> Even within the USSR and repressive government, it transformed eventually. 
</I>
If you want to assume the worst, you should consider us becoming the
Emergents, in Vernor Vinge's A Deepness In The Sky novel. 

I do not see how we can recover from that once we're there. This isn't

</I>&gt;<i> through endless hoops on command. :-( My idea of a happy work life at this 
</I>&gt;<i> point is just going to a research lab everyday (an IBM Research like in the 
</I>&gt;<i> 1970s when people like Gerry O'Neill came to give talks about space 
</I>&gt;<i> settlemest?) doing something worthwhile and having a nice meal for lunch 
</I>
Not many people are that lucky, these days.

&gt;<i> talking to colleagues. I would not have spent decades outside the system 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to make changes if I did not think they were essential to our very 
</I>&gt;<i> survival (especially because of the risk of nuclear war). Frankly, I 
</I>&gt;<i> probably would have preferred to be a &quot;loser&quot; earning US$200K with the rest 
</I>&gt;<i> of my class (even Michelle); see this humorous item to understand that 
</I>&gt;<i> comment:
</I>
[...]

&gt;<i> A &quot;technological fix&quot; with encryption like you suggest does not really 
</I>&gt;<i> address the core issues of a changing society. The core problem IMHO is 
</I>
If the society does not use the tools for privacy, the society might find
itself in a failure mode quite difficult to impossible to recover from.

&quot;We have no privacy anyway, so we can give up already&quot; is exactly the 
unconstructive attitude to take. History tends to take a dim view on quislings.

&gt;<i> scarcity-based assumptions at the core of the current political process (as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as economic processes like around even Google), but politicians and 
</I>&gt;<i> business people increasing having to make decisions about using and 
</I>&gt;<i> improving an infrastructure that can produce vast abundance.
</I>
Right now the current political and business process is directed towards
surveillance and control of uprisings in the coming scarcity scenarios.
 
&gt;<i> Consider, as one example:
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party</A>
</I>
I am an active member of the Pirate Party and so should you.

&gt;<i> More on jury nullification:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification</A>
</I>
Jury is specific to anglosaxon law, IIRC.

&gt;<i> Guns are like encryption in a sense. Like locks, maybe they help keep 
</I>&gt;<i> honest people honest, but they are not going to do much against organized 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts by government to do something to you. I've tried a few times with 
</I>
I happen to disagree about that too.

&gt;<i> conservatives to take them step by step through the idea of how guns may 
</I>&gt;<i> protect their rights realistically in our society and have never gotten a 
</I>&gt;<i> good answer; history in the USA shows the now-despicable internment of 
</I>&gt;<i> Japanese-Americans went relatively smoothly even with a lot of guns around.
</I>
The difference between US and EU is that EU does not even have guns to take
away first.
 
&gt;<i> One problem is that the fifth box (ammo box -- which I question the 
</I>&gt;<i> effectiveness and morality of, especially just compared to non-cooperation)
</I>
Who's interested in morality when you have a civil war in your hands?

&gt;<i> &quot;Social Movements and Strategic Nonviolence&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_nonviolence.html">http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_nonviolence.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have made many people complacent about all the others. Like the 
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted box, the ammo box does not make anything better by itself. Iraq 
</I>&gt;<i> showed how easy it is to tear apart a society in a way that may take 
</I>&gt;<i> decades to heal. You can hide all the transactions you want behind 
</I>&gt;<i> encryption for a time until society falls down around you, too.
</I>
Some severe cognitive dissonance here.
 
&gt;<i> So, rather than focus on encryption, one might focus on making more free 
</I>&gt;<i> content of hight quality, or more free (or even non-free, sadly, like 
</I>&gt;<i> Konarka) designs for technology that produces abundance. Like guns, 
</I>
What if this is against the law and will land you in jail?
What if perpetuation of scarcity is exactly the appropriate
control paradigm, and you're the square peg that is in the way?

&gt;<i> encryption may be useful if you want to keep some information away from 
</I>&gt;<i> thieves (who won't try too hard to grab any one person's credit card 
</I>&gt;<i> numbers), but it won't protect anything in the long term from a determined 
</I>&gt;<i> government. Following Manuel de Landa's idea, I suggest we always will have 
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of one, as we have a healthy balance of meshworks and 
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies. You are trying to deny hierarchies some power with encryption, 
</I>&gt;<i> but they can still get it in other ways. The bigger issue is how do we keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the hierarchies accountable for the health of society?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the deeper issue is, what kind of government do we want? And what kind 
</I>
I prefer technology forms leading to empowerment of individuals, not more 
control for superpersonal organisation forms. Encryption as a means for
privacy, strong authentication, trust and tamper-hardening are key parts 
of that of that technology box.

&gt;<i> of society to go with it? And then how do we act to build that society 
</I>&gt;<i> within the possibilities that seem reasonable?
