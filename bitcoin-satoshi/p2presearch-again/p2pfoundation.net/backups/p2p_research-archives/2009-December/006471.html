<PRE>I have followed Marshall Brain's efforts on the web for a number of years.
I note your enthusiasm and will read some of the links.  I agree largely
with what follows...

</I>&gt;<i> Marshall Brain was the first person I read who was really explicit, step by
</I>&gt;<i> step, about the link between automation and joblessness at all levels,
</I>&gt;<i> especially in Manna. It had been said before for a long time, but he really
</I>&gt;<i> seemed especially clear about it. And he makes clear an economic link in the
</I>&gt;<i> sidebar here, written around 2002:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm">http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Jobless Recovery&quot; that we are currently experiencing in the U.S. is
</I>&gt;<i> big news. See for example The Mystery of the 'jobless recovery':
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Consider these facts: Employment growth at the moment is the lowest for
</I>&gt;<i> any recovery since the government started keeping such statistics in 1939.
</I>&gt;<i> The labor force shrank in July as discouraged workers stopped seeking
</I>&gt;<i> employment. The number of people employed has fallen by more than 1 million
</I>&gt;<i> since the &quot;recovery&quot; began in the fall of 2001.&quot; [ref]
</I>&gt;<i>  The Washington Post notes that we are now witnessing, &quot;the longest hiring
</I>&gt;<i> downturn since the Depression&quot;. [ref] The article also notes, &quot;The vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the 2.7 million job losses since the 2001 recession began were
</I>&gt;<i> the result of permanent changes in the U.S. economy and are not coming
</I>&gt;<i> back.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  There is no mystery -- the jobless recovery is exactly what you would
</I>&gt;<i> expect in a robotic nation. When automation and robots eliminate jobs, they
</I>&gt;<i> are gone for good. The economy then has to invent new jobs. But it is much
</I>&gt;<i> harder to do that now because robots can quickly fill the new jobs that get
</I>&gt;<i> invented. See the FAQ for additional information.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His ideas have been amplified here: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobless_recovery">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobless_recovery</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Especially with your comments, it does seem like employment is where &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> rubber meets the road&quot; as far as post-scarcity trends. To me, I see the
</I>&gt;<i> videos of laboratory robots and they are persuasive, especially as I have
</I>&gt;<i> been watching them change slowly for the past three decades or so (all the
</I>&gt;<i> way back to seeing 1970s videos on &quot;NOVA&quot; about Stanford's Shakey and MIT's
</I>&gt;<i> SHRDLU simulation and some small robots there). But maybe those videos are
</I>&gt;<i> just dismissed by others? Employment has long been a political issue in the
</I>&gt;<i> politics of many countries, and it does seem that unemployment rates are the
</I>&gt;<i> undeniable statistic (as much as they are fudged in various ways).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm realizing, looking at the statistics, is that jobs have been
</I>&gt;<i> slower and slower to come back after each recession. It used to be jobs were
</I>&gt;<i> linked more closely with GDP, but now they are a &quot;trailing indicator&quot;. And
</I>&gt;<i> the amount they trail by gets longer and longer. So, right now, mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> economists are saying jobs will come back in two or three years from now.
</I>&gt;<i> But, recessions have been happening every five years or so now. The
</I>&gt;<i> recession has been ongoing for almost two years. So, what happens when
</I>&gt;<i> employment begins to lag enough so it overlaps the next recession? At that
</I>&gt;<i> point, will jobs ever come back? I predict, if we don't see a more sudden
</I>&gt;<i> shock (or riots), or if there is not a major social reform, that is what we
</I>&gt;<i> might see over the next decade, even if there is an uptick in jobs in a
</I>&gt;<i> couple years. Recessions are times when firms try hard to be more efficient
</I>&gt;<i> as opposed to being more expansive. If firms start automating more heavily
</I>&gt;<i> to become more efficient, using all the technology that is now available in
</I>&gt;<i> the labs, many more jobs will be lost. If the technology is available to
</I>&gt;<i> replace people more cheaply than to pay the people, under capitalism, the
</I>&gt;<i> firms have to use it to survive. And it would be a good thing, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> everyone shared in the benefits -- but under capitalism, short of high taxes
</I>&gt;<i> and a basic income, the average person won't see the benefits of automation
</I>&gt;<i> (just like for the last three decades in the USA the average worker has not
</I>&gt;<i> seen their pay increase, although it is true some products have gotten much
</I>&gt;<i> better at the same cost).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marshall Brain paints the extermination scenario as one of two
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities (the other is a basic income, or more accurately people's
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism of a sort, because it only goes to owners of a company). Some
</I>&gt;<i> might call this broad extermination evolution in action, although I'd not
</I>&gt;<i> agree; to state the hopefully obvious, I think genetic diversity is good for
</I>&gt;<i> all sorts of reasons, and, as with a recent post, humans have succeeded more
</I>&gt;<i> by cooperation than selfishness. But if you look at Nazi Germany, they did
</I>&gt;<i> succeed for a time in a pyramid scheme sort of way by taking those who could
</I>&gt;<i> not work in the war factories and exterminating them (often by working them
</I>&gt;<i> to death in concentration camps on trivial tasks, but also by direct
</I>&gt;<i> executions). One aspect of the Nazi regime was to kill all the people in
</I>&gt;<i> nursing homes or hospitals for the mentally ill, to free up the workers who
</I>&gt;<i> were caring for these people to work in the war effort. And of course Jews,
</I>&gt;<i> Gypsies, Gays, and others were killed and their property confiscated. In
</I>&gt;<i> general, killing all these people, as well as then killing people in other
</I>&gt;<i> lands and taking their resources, all promoted prosperity for the survivors.
</I>&gt;<i> It's kind of like if someone were to heat their house by ripping boards from
</I>&gt;<i> the walls and burning them. It works for a time, until the place gets drafty
</I>&gt;<i> and the roof starts to fall in from lack of support. It's a pyramid scheme
</I>&gt;<i> of the worst sort:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;How Germans Fell for the 'Feel-Good' Fuehrer&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,347726,00.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,347726,00.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, with robots, it's a little different. What's the pyramid scheme
</I>&gt;<i> there? I guess one can assume that, with lagging feedback (a Keynesian
</I>&gt;<i> concept) that as companies replace each worker, the newly unemployed person
</I>&gt;<i> burns through their savings, credit, and short-term state-supplied
</I>&gt;<i> unemployment aid to still purchase the products the robots are producing for
</I>&gt;<i> a time. So, let's imagine an economy with one factory that makes everything,
</I>&gt;<i> and one owner/manager, and one worker (who both buy everything they need
</I>&gt;<i> from the factory). The owner/manager replace the worker with a robot, and
</I>&gt;<i> for a time, the worker still spends savings and borrows money to buy
</I>&gt;<i> products from the factory, and the owner/manager gets more profits, so it is
</I>&gt;<i> a net positive in the short term for the owner. Then the worker runs out of
</I>&gt;<i> money and starves to death and stops buying stuff after the funeral
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements. At that point, the owner is paying himself or herself, and
</I>&gt;<i> while they have less revenues, they still, by virtue of ownership, can pay
</I>&gt;<i> themselves in product (or fiat dollars that are just turned around to buy
</I>&gt;<i> product), and then we have Patrick Anderson's plan where people produce
</I>&gt;<i> product for themselves and the factories are owned by the people who benefit
</I>&gt;<i> from them. :-) Related:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[p2p-research] Paying Investors With Product Solves the Paradox of Profit
</I>&gt;<i> in Perfect Competition&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, that's a pretty evil way to get to Patrick's scenario as it
</I>&gt;<i> entails disposing of 90% to 99.9%+ of the population in some way. :-( And
</I>&gt;<i> it's obviously not what he suggests or had in mind. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that is basically what the first part of &quot;Manna&quot; outlines.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm">http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The more &quot;humane&quot; way may just be for poor people to not have children,
</I>&gt;<i> including by, as Marshall Brain outlines in Manna, putting contraceptives in
</I>&gt;<i> their water supply. Historically, humans have regulated their birth rate
</I>&gt;<i> based on local physical affluence. However, this transition to full
</I>&gt;<i> automation is happening so fast this won't be possible. Also, rich people
</I>&gt;<i> are sometimes personally selfish and don't have many children they raise
</I>&gt;<i> themselves; in general all &quot;affluent&quot; industrialized countries are facing
</I>&gt;<i> lower than replacement birth rates. And, I would suggest such a policy is
</I>&gt;<i> really immoral anyway, given that &quot;poor&quot; people are only materially poor
</I>&gt;<i> because of politics related to not sharing and by fiat declaring that all
</I>&gt;<i> humans do not have a right to the commons, as well as by devaluing some very
</I>&gt;<i> important skills like parenting and being a good neighbor and instead
</I>&gt;<i> overvaluing some abstract skills (like writing reports and programs. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Related:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm">http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The world's most primitive people have few possessions. but they are not
</I>&gt;<i> poor. Poverty is not a certain small amount of goods, nor is it just a
</I>&gt;<i> relation between means and ends; above all it is a relation between people.
</I>&gt;<i> Poverty is a social status. As such it is the invention of civilisation. It
</I>&gt;<i> has grown with civilisation, at once as an invidious distinction between
</I>&gt;<i> classes and more importantly as a tributary relation that can render
</I>&gt;<i> agrarian peasants more susceptible to natural catastrophes than any winter
</I>&gt;<i> camp of Alaskan Eskimo.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in that sense, unemployment is a social construction. But the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;employment&quot; is clearly a weak point in a high-tech economy:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://educationanddemocracy.org/FSCfiles/C_CC2a_TripleRevolution.htm">http://educationanddemocracy.org/FSCfiles/C_CC2a_TripleRevolution.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The industrial system was designed to produce an ever-increasing quantity
</I>&gt;<i> of goods as efficiently as possible, and it was assumed that the
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of the power to purchase these goods would occur almost
</I>&gt;<i> automatically. The continuance of the income-through-jobs link as the only
</I>&gt;<i> major mechanism for distributing effective demand &#8212; for granting the right
</I>&gt;<i> to consume &#8212; now acts as the main brake on the almost unlimited capacity of
</I>&gt;<i> a cybernated productive system.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is one reason the trend has been as slow to play out as it has it
</I>&gt;<i> is because, as Hans Moravec pointed out, the things that humans can do that
</I>&gt;<i> relate to millions of years of pre-human evolution, basically navigation and
</I>&gt;<i> hand-eye coordination, have been much more difficult to automate than
</I>&gt;<i> expected. He wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1983/mit.txt">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1983/mit.txt</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The human evolutionary record provides the  clue. While  our  sensory  and
</I>&gt;<i> muscle control systems have been in development for a billion years, and
</I>&gt;<i> common sense reasoning has been honed for probably about a million, really
</I>&gt;<i> high level, deep, thinking is little more than a parlor trick, culturally
</I>&gt;<i> developed over a few thousand years, which a few  humans, operating  largely
</I>&gt;<i>  against their natures, can learn [2] [8] [21]. As with Samuel Johnson's
</I>&gt;<i> dancing dog, what is amazing is not how well it is done, but that it is done
</I>&gt;<i> at all.
</I>&gt;<i>  Computers  can  challenge  humans in intellectual areas, where humans
</I>&gt;<i> perform inefficiently, because they can be programmed to carry on much less
</I>&gt;<i> wastefully. An extreme example is arithmetic, a function learned by humans
</I>&gt;<i> with great difficulty, which is instinctive to computers. These days an
</I>&gt;<i> average computer can add a million large numbers in a second, which is more
</I>&gt;<i> than a million times faster than a person, and with no errors. Yet one
</I>&gt;<i> hundred  millionth of the neurons in a human brain, if reorganized into an
</I>&gt;<i> adder using switching logic design principles, could sum a thousand numbers
</I>&gt;<i> per second. If the whole  brain were organized this way it could do sums one
</I>&gt;<i> hundred thousand times faster than the computer.
</I>&gt;<i>  Computers do not challenge  humans in perceptual and control areas because
</I>&gt;<i> these billion year old functions are carried out by large fractions of the
</I>&gt;<i> nervous system operating as efficiently as the hypothetical neuron adder
</I>&gt;<i> above. Present  day  computers, however efficiently programmed, are simply
</I>&gt;<i> too puny to keep up. Evidence comes from the most extensive piece  of
</I>&gt;<i>  reverse  engineering yet done on the vertebrate brain, the functional
</I>&gt;<i> decoding of some of the visual system by D. H. Hubel, T. N.  Weisel and
</I>&gt;<i> colleagues [11]. ...
</I>&gt;<i>  Later in this paper I express my confidence that sufficiently powerful
</I>&gt;<i> general purpose machines will become available gradually during the
</I>&gt;<i> professional lifetimes of most reading this.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, that was written in 1983, and as Hans Moravec predicted, given
</I>&gt;<i> Moore's law, almost thirty years later computers are more than a million
</I>&gt;<i> times faster for the same cost, and now they can do better hand-eye
</I>&gt;<i> coordination and so on, as in the video you linked to a while back:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;High-Speed Robot Hand Demonstrates Dexterity and Skillful Manipulation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hizook.com/blog/2009/08/03/high-speed-robot-hand-demonstrates-dexterity-and-skillful-manipulation">http://www.hizook.com/blog/2009/08/03/high-speed-robot-hand-demonstrates-dexterity-and-skillful-manipulation</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or as shown in the DARPA Grand Challenges in terms of navigation. Or in
</I>&gt;<i> other areas:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[p2p-research] Robot videos and P2P implications (was Re: A thirty year
</I>&gt;<i> future...)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-November/005926.html">http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-November/005926.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While these systems still have their limits, we can see the clear
</I>&gt;<i> progression of such technologies over the past thirty years. Or, at least I
</I>&gt;<i> can, because I hung around those labs decades ago (including in Hans' :-)
</I>&gt;<i> and see the changes. I guess a big part of my conscious and subconscious
</I>&gt;<i> mental capacity has gone to thinking about the issues that his insights and
</I>&gt;<i> efforts (and those of others in such labs or elsewhere) have brought up.
</I>&gt;<i> It's frustrating to me that others cannot more easily see this. But I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it is even more frustrating to someone like Hans Moravec. :-) I guess it is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to expect people who pay attention to other things to take that
</I>&gt;<i> seriously trends that are slowly playing out and may take years of
</I>&gt;<i> involvement to really appreciate. I'm sure some people might say that about,
</I>&gt;<i> say, DNA research that I know little about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, I'm not so sure I like Hans Moravec's &quot;Mind Children&quot; idea as the
</I>&gt;<i> only good result of all this (the robots go into space and humanity
</I>&gt;<i> essentially dies out. :-) Social networks and augmentation are other
</I>&gt;<i> approaches. (Even as they still may lead to unemployment, since, say, one
</I>&gt;<i> augmented surgeon might be able to do the work of 10 regular surgeons.) And
</I>&gt;<i> there may just be a lot of value in an ecological diversity of mentalities
</I>&gt;<i> and forms. The horseshoe crab in various similar physical forms has survived
</I>&gt;<i> for 445 million years even as other creatures have evolved a lot around it.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab</A>
