<PRE>Dear Austin,

concerning your possible adaptation of your research,

here's what I would be very interested in:

- a study of actual business models used by existing open
design/manufacturing models, as practiced by arduino, openmoko, buglabs  as
well as uncovering the new field of open energy research and design ...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Austin,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, I look at the reason why a proposal is being made--the problem it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sets out to solve.  I'm glad you explicitly state this, because so often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> readers are left to assume.  You say, &quot;The current energy, environmental,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and economic crises all have roots dating back to the 1970s (even further in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact), and thus far, neither free-market nor government solutions have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brought us out of this quagmire.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm skeptical that this frames a problem in a meaningful way. The crises
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and failed solutions are vague. Which problem are you hoping to solve?  How
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do you know it's a root problem, and not a symptom of something else?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Continuing, you do give a general answer of the proposal's goal: &quot;bring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renewable energy solutions to market.&quot; This implies that the problem you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see, and are trying to solve, is that we don't have enough or good enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renewable energy solutions.  Again, I'm skeptical that this follows from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your statement about the &quot;quagmire.&quot;  Also, I'm left wondering, what are the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criteria for the quagmire being resolved?  Energy consumption will continue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to increase until the cost of energy rises enough to reduce consumption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Implicit is the assumption that renewable energy can solve your stated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.  Plenty of people make this assumption, but I've yet to see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convincing evidence.  There are no guarantees focused R&amp;D will solve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems, particularly when breakthroughs are needed for viability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You also say &quot;The goal is not to prove that this model is or isn&#8217;t viable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (although I hope that it is). Rather my goal is to accumulate the skills
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary to make even more substantive contributions in the future.&quot;  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like this real goal, it's mine as well.  However, to accumulate skills for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more substantive contributions, you need to assess the viability of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal--how else can the skills be built?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll now leave my critique of your premise for the proposal, and assume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the purpose follows rationally from the problem, so we can look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economics of your proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Michel asks if we need royalties, and includes some good points.  I'll be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> covering similar ground, from a different angle.  If you included royalties,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you had a reason, so let's question it.  My question: what are the economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implications of royalties in this situation?  I'll answer this with a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The point of having information in the commons is not just more eyes,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but also production at the lowest possible cost--in economics terms, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lowest possible barriers to entry.  Crowdsourcing for private profit isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new, and doesn't fall under the general definition of p2p used by the p2pf.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Looking at the implicit reasoning behind the proposal, the ends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (renewable energy tech) are being used to justify the means (locking up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production with a royalty scheme).  The ends aren't worth the means, and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't know of any strong evidence that such a scheme would result in more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renewable energy innovation than making all IP part of an information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commons that actually lowers barriers to entry for producers.  In this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, the barriers to entry for innovation are raised implicitly--an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> innovator must add in royalty costs when producing derivative products.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. The monitoring and enforcement infrastructure required to ensure rent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collection raises costs, for sure.  The public inevitably pays these costs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in one way or another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, to revisit the concept of p2p.  All nonrival goods creation supported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by peer effort or money should be part of an accessible information commons,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if not also licensed in a GPLish way, i.e. &quot;source&quot; such as research data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be made available (disclosing data should be a norm for studies now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyway), and further derivative works--if applicable--must fall under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same license.  All peers must be able to produce, using information in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commons for free, to achieve the lowest possible barrier to entry.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Austin,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> May I ask you a very basic question: do we really need royalties?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Let's assume that a company designs and sells electronic circuit boards,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but uses open designs. It still can sell the 'products' with a moderate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> profit, and re-invest part of that in its own research, while sustaining an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overall commons with other companies similarly engaged. On top of that, it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can keep a moderate amount of dually licensed improvements, of its own
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making. This is what I think happens in the OS world, dual licensing is what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the companies themselves develop, on top of the open commons.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Presumably, there's a problem with such a system for large upfront
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> investments, but this could for example be supported by grant money for the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> public good, as if for example proposed for pharma research by Stiglizt and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> others.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If adapt such a policy, don't you largely remove the problems with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> monitoring, rewarding etc..., i.e. you just retain it for the marginal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> improvements, like it is currently done, while the bulk is done in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> commons and does not need anything but 'acknowledgement and recognition,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which is automatically traceable in open design systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Michel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    Hello P2P and Open community,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanx for the flood of responses....very encouraging.  Because I'm in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kuala Lumpur at the moment, I'm probably 12+ hours ahead of most of you &#8230;and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will work through these emails in reverse order to ensure that I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer questions that have already been answered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I see that Stan and Michel's emails about royalties are very similar,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I have tried to combine my responses....a bit long&#8230;but I tried to be as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thorough as possible.  By explaining my background and reasoning, perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can uncover more holes and pose more questions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To Michel's questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another good point.  Are royalties entirely necessary.  I'm not really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure actually.  Because I have to approach the problem from a purely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> academic perspective (sigh), I have to use existing frameworks&#8230;.and based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the journals I'd read, dual licensing, open innovation, stakeholder theory,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network theory were all the most applicable existing models that I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find, and licensing/royalties came up quite a bit under the first two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frameworks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the other reason I selected royalties is because they only apply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to successful uses.  i.e. they encourage manufacturing companies to take a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stab without too much risk.  You only pay if you win. So yes, producers must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factor in the cost of royalties&#8230;.but&#8230;they don't have to pay for these costs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upfront.  So in theory, this could lower barriers to entry.  I like the idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you listed above about selling products, but my focus was more on R&amp;D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exclusively.  i.e. you have a centralized (or networked) R&amp;D entity and they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focus in this area only&#8230;.this info goes into the commons, and then producers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could use this R&amp;D for their own purposes.  Whatever I as a producer was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spending on R&amp;D before&#8230;.in theory, I can spend less now since someone else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is doing much of the work for me.  This also means that companies without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large R&amp;D budgets can enter the game, so there would be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> competition&#8230;.which could lead to more innovation.  I must stress that this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is all intuition and not based on any evidence.  I just tried to apply my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very very limited understanding of economics, open source, and innovation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main stumbling block with royalties, however, is litigation and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enforcement.  It's sounding like there is no way to keep royalties in place
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AND keep enforcement costs down.  So even if R&amp;D costs go down for everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you still have high costs in other areas (higher in fact).  I'm wondering if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is another way to attract enough funding to sustain this model&#8230;.and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe even pay back initial investors.  I like the general idea of donations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and government funding, but would this be enough?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the advantage of being early enough in my research to change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directions, so I would be interested in exploring any other options.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To Stan:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think I understand now the vagueness of my research assumptions.  Thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for pointing that out (if you didn't do this now, my graders eventually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would).  Let me try to bring greater clarity if I can....here goes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I understand it, the two holy grails of renewable energy are capture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and storage.  Fossil fuel, for all of its faults, already addresses these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two issues.  In addition, the switching costs are very high since, despite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many externalities like environmental damage, fossil fuel and renewable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy are perfect substitutes, but the former is much cheaper by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comparison.  So even if we manage to solve the capture and storage issues,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convincing users to purchase renewable energy (RE) might prove difficult.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd have to do more research on the diffusion of innovation with regards to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newly created substitutes, but it would seem that for widespread use to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occur, the price of renewable energy would have to come down enough so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people are incentivized to cross over.  Government taxes, subsidies, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mandates could help.  And of course, many people are price insensitive when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they know they're making a difference.  But still, we have a long way to go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Making RE more efficient, transportable, and cheaper can happen any number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of ways.  Economies of scale and gradual improvements could do the trick.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> New breakthroughs and outside the box thinking is another path.  In either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case, however, greater research and development is required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, R&amp;D, thus far, has been problematic since it can be expensive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (meaning not enough players at the table) and it is often proprietary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (creating silos of secrecy and redundancy).   It is quite possible that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions to capture, storage, and price already exist&#8230;but due to closed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> networks, no one has been able to connect the dots.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the goal of my paper is how best to lower R&amp;D costs, invite the highest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of collaborative contributors, and attract the largest amounts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding&#8230;.in order to speed up innovation, solve the capture, storage, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price issues, and help bring RE products to market that can compete with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extant fossil fuel technologies.  My reasons for wanting to remove fossil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fuels from the equation are varied&#8230;resource wars, the environment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pollution, Hubbert's Peak, etc.  I'm not nearly as concerned about which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renewable energy succeeds (I imagine that any open community will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-organizing and the better ideas will rise to the top&#8230;especially if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> driven by external market forces)&#8230;.I just want enough new ideas to work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (gradual innovations and breakthrough technologies).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When working out potential frameworks, I disqualified traditional market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions (since they haven't worked so far), and traditional open solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (since some aspects of this project might need generous funding from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning and in regular installments thereafter).  Perhaps excluding both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or either was premature (I'm quite new to open communities).  In any event,I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed the current framework which tries to combine aspects of both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (perhaps a forced fit).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I imagined what incentives each of the relevant stakeholders would need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throughout the value chain (I'm still an MBA student&#8230;for better or for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worse, and the value chain has been drilled into me&#8230;.sigh).  I also tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design this framework so that government involvement could help&#8230;.but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a prerequisite for success.  i.e., if this model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be shown to work, any group of people (investors, scientists,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> citizens, and manufacturing companies) could lift it off the ground.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope this clarifies things a bit Stan.  It helps my own thinking to 1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you poke holes in my assumptions and framing&#8230;.and 2.  To force me to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more clearly verbalize my ideas.  If and when you have time, I welcome even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more feedback.  Gonna turn to other responses in my inbox.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all the help everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
