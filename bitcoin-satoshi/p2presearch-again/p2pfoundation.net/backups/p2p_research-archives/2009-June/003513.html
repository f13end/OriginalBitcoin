&quot; June 23, 2009 - The United Nations Millennium Campaign today released an
analysis showing that *

**since the inception of aid (overseas development assistance) almost 50
years ago, donor countries have given some $2 trillion in aid.** And yet

years represents just eleven percent of the money found for financial
institutions in one year.**

Subject: Financial Industry Receives 10 Times More Money in 1 year than Poor
Countries Receive in 49 Years


Ahead of UN General Assembly's high-level summit on the economic crisis on
June 24-26, UN Millennium Campaign says new analysis indicates that finding
money for aid is a matter of political will - not lack of resources - and
calls on donors to finally meet their aid commitments

June 23, 2009 - The United Nations Millennium Campaign today released an
analysis showing that since the inception of aid (overseas development
assistance) almost 50 years ago, donor countries have given some $2 trillion
in aid. And yet over the past year, $18 trillion has been found globally to
bail out banks and other financial institutions. The amount of total aid
over the past 49 years represents just eleven percent of the money found for
financial institutions in one year. The UN Millennium Campaign is urgently
calling on rich countries gathering at this week's high-level summit on the
economic crisis to make no further excuses that they lack resources and to
urgently deliver on their aid commitments.

&quot;The stark contrast between the money dispersed to the world's desperately
poor after 49 years of painstaking summits and negotiations and the
staggering sums found virtually overnight to bail out the creators of the
global economic crisis makes it impossible for governments to any longer
claim that the world can't find the money to help the 50,000 people who are
dying of extreme poverty every day,&quot; said Salil Shetty, Director of the
United Nations Millennium Campaign. &quot;This is a straightforward question of
political will. Rich countries' priorities will become crystal clear at this
week's summit on the economic crisis, where we hope they will finally
deliver on the aid they have repeatedly pledged but not delivered to those
who need it most.&quot;

Worse still, the global economic crisis is expected to further impact the
delivery of aid to poor countries at a time when the need is greatest.
Already, the consequences of the crisis, caused by the richest people in the
richest countries, are being disproportionately borne by poor countries.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the economic crisis has
resulted in 100 million more people going hungry, taking the total number of
hungry people in the world to a staggering one billion. At the same time,
only $9.4 billion of the $28.3 billion -- less than a third -- pledged at
the Gleneagles Summit in 2005 to be delivered to Sub-Saharan Africa by 2010,
has actually been delivered.

The Millennium Campaign believes any discussions of a new financial
architecture must be inclusive of the voices and needs of the poor. *The
Campaign is therefore calling on donor countries to immediately and
unconditionally do the following:*

   - Urgently agree to a timetable to accelerate delivery of their aid
   commitments.
   - Make rapid progress toward achieving the Paris Declaration and Accra
   Agenda to simplify and streamline aid, including a clear timetable for
   implementation of existing commitments.
   - Reduce and/or eliminate all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies.
   - Ensure that poor countries are fully represented in all decision making
   bodies and in the restructuring of the global financial infrastructure.

*The Millennium Campaign is calling on poor countries to immediately do the
following:*

   - Ensure that national development policies and plans are pro-poor and
   focused on women and excluded groups.
   - Prioritize expenditures on the Millennium Development Goals.
   - Ensure accountability and transparency in the management of public
   money.
   - Prioritize domestic resource mobilization.

 Note to editors:
The UN Millennium Campaign was established by the UN Secretary General in
2002. The Campaign supports citizens' efforts to hold their governments to
account for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The
Millennium Development Goals were adopted by 189 world leaders from the
north and south, as part of the Millennium Declaration which was signed in
2000. These leaders agreed to eradicate extreme poverty and its root causes
by 2015. Our premise is simple: we are the first generation that can end
poverty and we refuse to miss this opportunity. For more information, visit
