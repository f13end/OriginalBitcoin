</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After some consideration, I've decided that the post-capitalism talk is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; largely Utopian fantasy:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, a lot of it depends on what you mean by &quot;post-capitalism,&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> hinges on just how much things would have to deviate from the current
</I>&gt;<i> model of corporate capitalism before it qualifies as fundamentally
</I>&gt;<i> different.  I believe that within a generation we're going to see a
</I>&gt;<i> radical shortening of supply and distribution chains from Peak Oil, a
</I>&gt;<i> combined relocalization of most production and an explosion of LETS
</I>&gt;<i> and barter networks as official money and wage employment dry up for a
</I>&gt;<i> major part of the population, and a collapse of the old corporate
</I>&gt;<i> proprietors in the culture and software industries.  I believe
</I>&gt;<i> there'll still be some long-distance trade (albeit a fraction of the
</I>&gt;<i> present value), and things called stock markets and corporations will
</I>&gt;<i> still exist (albeit at a fraction of their present importance in the
</I>&gt;<i> overall economy); if this means that &quot;capitalism&quot; will exist in your
</I>&gt;<i> terminology, well and good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Current financial assets are considerably more than all non-cash
</I>&gt;<i> assets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the world.  Over the counter derivatives alone in 2007 were over 600
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trillion USD.  (that's trillion with a T).  The innovation that has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; financial markets goes on strong and the wealth created is anything but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fictitious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The growth of the financial sector compared to physical assets is a
</I>&gt;<i> major symptom of the problem.   Given corporate capitalism's chronic
</I>&gt;<i> tendency toward overproduction and overinvestment, you can't invest
</I>&gt;<i> the surplus in plant and equipment that will generate even more goods
</I>&gt;<i> when people can't consume existing output.  So you pile up the surplus
</I>&gt;<i> investment capital in a FIRE sector that only works until the ponzi
</I>&gt;<i> scheme collapses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. The total global gross product (GDP of the world in 2007) was about 47
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trillion USD (almost 14 trillion of that in the USA).  So far in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recession/depression, it has sunk globally by about 2% and certainly not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more than 4%.  Total stock market valuations were 51 trillion in 2007 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are perhaps slightly less than that now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The U.S. stock market valuations a couple of months ago were about 50%
</I>&gt;<i> of their 2007 high, and still less than two-thirds.  Real estate
</I>&gt;<i> prices have plummeted as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7. Unemployment in the US is just reach 10% where it has been sustained
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years in other nations like Germany.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When adjusted realistically for underemployed and discouraged workers,
</I>&gt;<i> it's more like 15% or 16%, which is about the equilibrium FDR managed
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve in the late '30s, and would probably have continued
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely had not WWII saved corporate capitalism.  That's not a
</I>&gt;<i> very high bar for success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8. Capitalism in Asia and Africa is taking off considerably.  The
</I>&gt;<i> potential for growth is     &gt; probably only bound by climate change issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a big &quot;only.&quot;  First of all, one reason for the growth of the
</I>&gt;<i> FIRE economy from the '90s on was that the export of industrial
</I>&gt;<i> capital had reached its limits as a strategy for solving the crisis of
</I>&gt;<i> overinvestment.  China is saturated with more industrial capital than
</I>&gt;<i> there is a market for.  And second, there's not much future in
</I>&gt;<i> shipping goods overseas from Chinese factories when fuel costs two or
</I>&gt;<i> three--or more--times what it did this time last year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 12. Even with a collapse of the dollar, oil exploding to several hundred
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dollars a barrel (both of which are reasonably feasible), there is little
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest that this would be more than a hiccup for markets and capitalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is hard to believe.  Had oil stayed at its summer 2008 prices
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely, some 20% of airline routes would have shut down and a
</I>&gt;<i> comparable percentage of long-haul trucks left the market.  And this
</I>&gt;<i> was indeed a &quot;hiccup&quot; compared to what we can expect from Peak Oil in
</I>&gt;<i> the future.  Even a supply shortfall of a few percent can cause prices
</I>&gt;<i> at the pump to double.  What can we expect when supply falls by half
</I>&gt;<i> or two-thirds over the next generation?  I expect we'll see a total
</I>&gt;<i> collapse of intercontinental supply chains except in vital minerals,
</I>&gt;<i> and an order of magnitude of reduction of continental supply chains
</I>&gt;<i> for most manufactured goods.  The factories in China and Vietnam will
</I>&gt;<i> become useless for anything but producing goods for people in--well,
</I>&gt;<i> in China and Vietnam.  Production of spare parts and modular
</I>&gt;<i> accessories will grow massively at the expense of production of new
</I>&gt;<i> goods, and the growth in such production of spare parts and modular
</I>&gt;<i> accessories will occur mainly in flexible manufacturing nets in
</I>&gt;<i> relocalized industrial economies.  In-season produce will be almost
</I>&gt;<i> entirely relocalized by backyard gardening and market gardening, and a
</I>&gt;<i> much larger percentage of our diets will be either in-season or canned
</I>&gt;<i> local stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're barely two years into the real crisis:  two years from when real
</I>&gt;<i> estate prices began to slide, a year from when Peak Oil first became a
</I>&gt;<i> household word, and nine months since inventories and employment began
</I>&gt;<i> a free-fall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To say &quot;everything's OK so far&quot; this early in the process is IMO about
</I>&gt;<i> like saying, immediately after Alaric's first repulse from the gates
</I>&gt;<i> of Rome, &quot;Well, the system's still got a lot of life in it.&quot;  Or the
</I>&gt;<i> old joke about the optimist who fell off a 100-story skyscraper and
</I>&gt;<i> shouted to the people on the 99th floor, &quot;OK so far!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That said, I think P2P is exciting, vital and an excellent tonic to
</I>&gt;<i> excesses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of capitalism and markets.  However, I am convinced the main issue is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; climate change.  If there is an Achilles' heel of capitalism, it is
</I>&gt;<i> climate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, yeah.   But that's a biggie.  The whole export-oriented pattern
</I>&gt;<i> of growth you keep appealing to in China, and possibly in Africa in
</I>&gt;<i> the future, was becoming increasingly untenable even with oil at
</I>&gt;<i> $140/barrel last year, when McKinsey Quarterly was running articles
</I>&gt;<i> about corporations looking to shorten their supply chains from China
</I>&gt;<i> to Mexico.  What happens to that &quot;warehouses in container ships&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> distribution model when oil is $1000/barrel?  My guess is the ships
</I>&gt;<i> will be rusting, the shipping containers will serve as houses, and the
</I>&gt;<i> industry in China will be redirected to the Chinese domestic market if
</I>&gt;<i> it survives at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To say that things look good for capitalism except for Peak Oil is a
</I>&gt;<i> bit like saying your uncle is just like your aunt except for his
</I>&gt;<i> testicles.
