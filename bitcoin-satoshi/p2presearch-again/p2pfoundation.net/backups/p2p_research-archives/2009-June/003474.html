<PRE>Stan,

By definition, any private good is a rival good.  A non-rival good is, by
definition, public and non-material.  What is material is not always clear,
but ideas even if written down are probably always non-material.  However,
some public, non-material goods can be rival goods as is well understood.

A public idea can never be a rival good.  Writers produce so-called public
ideas.  Any code is a rival good if someone says it is private.  Rival and
private are very nearly synonyms in intellectual property.

Frankly, I'm not sure what rival and non-rival--basic microeconomic
ideas--has to do with anything.

Stallman is a good if ill man.  He is quite capable of nihilism and I have
been in the room when he spews it.  But my point was not about Stallman.  My
point was about absurdity and the anti-market tedium that really, to my
mind, has nothing whatsoever to do with P2P.

Ryan

&gt;<i> Ryan, I can't find much to agree with in the email thread, but wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> comment regarding Stallman:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, Stallman usually does not comment on &quot;intellectual property&quot; outside
</I>&gt;<i> of software patents and copyright.  On occasion he makes general statements,
</I>&gt;<i> but we should consider his perspectives about other areas &quot;loose,&quot; while his
</I>&gt;<i> perspectives on software are quite focused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, this statement is unclear, if not incorrect: &quot;He suggests that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone should be able to be paid so long as the borders and boundaries they
</I>&gt;<i> create are not destructive.&quot;  In this context &quot;should be able to be paid&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> suggests some sort of obligation others have to the creator, or idealistic
</I>&gt;<i> scenario.  Stallman says nothing about being &quot;able to be paid,&quot; only asking
</I>&gt;<i> to be paid, wanting to be paid, and wanting to maximize income; an important
</I>&gt;<i> distinction.  Again, this is within the explicit context of programming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third, since Stallman's statement was offered in the context of
</I>&gt;<i> programming, your statements about rival goods and services such as
</I>&gt;<i> universities, eating and sleeping, and so on, are outside the scope of his
</I>&gt;<i> comment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fourth, Stallman's software philosophy is fairly simple and consistent:
</I>&gt;<i> people should be free to share and use software.  Since others disagree, and
</I>&gt;<i> possess the legal means to exclude, Stallman created a legal wrapper to
</I>&gt;<i> apply his philosophy to all software he writes by securing the freedom to
</I>&gt;<i> use and share that software.  He strongly encourages everyone to consider
</I>&gt;<i> his philosophy of software freedom, and use the legal tools created to
</I>&gt;<i> secure that freedom, whether user or programmer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To accuse Stallman of &quot;nihilism&quot; should be a huge red flag indicating
</I>&gt;<i> hyperbole.  Stallman is the father of P2P software production, with very
</I>&gt;<i> clear and outspoken P2P values of voluntary contribution and software
</I>&gt;<i> commons-safeguarding.  He put his labor where his mouth was, and continues
</I>&gt;<i> to do so, with significant results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Stan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Stallman also wrote the following before them...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&#8220;Shouldn't a programmer be able to ask for a reward for his creativity?&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to maximize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one's income, as long as one does not use means that are destructive. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the means customary in the field of software today are based on destruction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and the ways that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program can be used. This reduces the amount of wealth that humanity derives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the program. When there is a deliberate choice to restrict, the harmful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consequences are deliberate destruction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means to become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become poorer from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mutual destructiveness. This is Kantian ethics; or, the Golden Rule. Since I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do not like the consequences that result if everyone hoards information, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am required to consider it wrong for one to do so. Specifically, the desire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be rewarded for one's creativity does not justify depriving the world in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general of all or part of that creativity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _____
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He suggests that anyone should be able to be paid so long as the borders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and boundaries they create are not destructive.  But then isn't all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> admissions to universities destructive by such logic?  Isn't any barrier to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any given use by anyone destructive in the same thread?  Shouldn't we all be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to sleep where we want and eat whatever is grown?  If maximum use is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the criteria of value, then any restriction on any property is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absurd--intellectual or not.  Surely professors don't own their research
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notes, their journal articles, their books or their lectures.  And the idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of security on all machines should be given over to simply a write-only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem--everything everywhere should be readable so that it can be used!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And no one need cite another author because that limits value!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Aren't all books and journals that are not open to any publication or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewing destructive?  Isn't the failure to share any thought or idea that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might have value to anyone a failure by such standards?  Stallman's writing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggests the absence of intellectual property--not the freedom to share.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once again, nihilism and fantasy instead of logic, responsibility and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sharing.  P2P deserves better.
