&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't look like that's true. Wikipedia again:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Arthur Young[45] first used the term capitalist in his work Travels in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; France (1792).[46] Samuel Taylor Coleridge,[45] an English poet, used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capitalist in his work Table Talk (1823).[47] Pierre-Joseph Proudhon used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capitalist in his first work What is Property? (1840) to refer to the
</I>&gt;<i> owners
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of capital. Benjamin Disraeli[45] used capitalist in the 1845 work Sybil.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels also used capitalist (Kapitalist) as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; private owner of capital in The Communist Manifesto (1848).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But all those references are to the use of &quot;capital-IST&quot; as someone
</I>&gt;<i> performing a particular economic function, whereas Dmytri's claim is
</I>&gt;<i> for the use of &quot;capital-ISM&quot; as a social system.  I was vaguely aware
</I>&gt;<i> that the &quot;capitalist&quot; usage predated &quot;capitalism&quot;;  but I still think
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capitalism&quot; came into widespread use by radical critics of the
</I>&gt;<i> system, and initially carried a largely pejorative connotation.  I get
</I>&gt;<i> the impression that both Mises' and Rand's preference for &quot;capitalism&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> over &quot;free enterprise&quot; reflected a deliberate intention to scandalize
</I>&gt;<i> by reclaiming what had been a slur (much like gay rights activists
</I>&gt;<i> using the term &quot;queer,&quot; etc.).
</I>

Yes, I realized after posting that I'd copied the wrong bit. The etymology
of &quot;Capitalism&quot; in Wikipedia is more ambiguous. It still doesn't seem to be
owned or innovated by socialist commentators, though.

Michel:

I think the central claim of Marx in terms of defining capitalism is the
&gt;<i> insistence that it can only exist after divorcing producers from the means
</I>&gt;<i> of production, giving rise to a specialized class that owns those means.
</I>

Not having read Marx, I probably can't comment intelligently, but I don't
think that's how things played out in the 20th century. While divisions of
wealth remained large, a middle-class formed which was able to engage in
business to a significant degree. Small businesses didn't come to dominate
the economy (probably for a range of reasons including economies of scale
and the design of business regulations) though some became big businesses -
it would be interesting to see statistics on these things.



The forms of this 'ownership' have changed quite a bit, they have become
&gt;<i> almost exclusively financial, but the basic expropriation remains. If there
</I>&gt;<i> were no workers to sell their labour, the system would instantly collapse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure of the significance of &quot;If there were no workers to sell their
labour, the system would instantly collapse.&quot; If there are no sellers in a
market, then there is no market, but I'm not sure whether that demonstrates
anything.


&gt;<i> However, there is one big change, and this is what we address at the p2p
</I>&gt;<i> foundation, which is that knowledge workers now own the means of immaterial
</I>&gt;<i> production, that represents a real shift.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree, that looks like a fundamental shift in work &amp; employment.
