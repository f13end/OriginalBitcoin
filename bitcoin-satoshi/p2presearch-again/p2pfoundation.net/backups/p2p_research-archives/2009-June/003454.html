As Eben Moglen said anecdotally during a
talk yesterday at the University of Iceland: &quot;Under capitalism, man
exploits man. Under communism it's the other way around.&quot; (there's a
partial audio recording at <A HREF="http://notendur.hi.is/~annaj/audio/">http://notendur.hi.is/~annaj/audio/</A> btw)

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Sorry for the late reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan Merten wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have frequently been asked what the difference is between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; libertarianism and anarchism, in light of the fact that anarchists have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; adopted the moral that libertarians have claimed ownership of, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; individual freedom is only limited by the equal freedom of others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with your description. But I expected that you describe an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anarchist alternative to libertarians instead of changing to their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The anarchist side is thoroughly documented from the angle of property
</I>&gt;<i> rights, whereas the libertarian stance takes property mostly as a given
</I>&gt;<i> and indulges itself only in discussion about the relative merits of
</I>&gt;<i> various forms of property. Thus my elaboration in that direction rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In light of recent events it is dilligent to ask of currency: is it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; scarce? Yes. Is it rival? Yes. Need this be the case?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This last question is important not least because it is so rarely asked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The monetary system has been constructed around the belief that all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; things are scarce and that all things are rival.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I'd go one step further: Money *encodes* scarcity (where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scarcity means a man-made limitation). If you want to end up at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commons (i.e. absense of scarcity) you have simply no more use for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your mistake here is that you confuse commons with abundance, which is
</I>&gt;<i> something I previously thought not to be possible, but it is exactly for
</I>&gt;<i> this reason that I urge people to consider the difference between the
</I>&gt;<i> abundance/scarcity axis and the rivalry/sociality axis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many commons are scarce, in the sense that with sensible use they may
</I>&gt;<i> yet be depleted. Further, a multitude of things are abundant but do not
</I>&gt;<i> exist in the commons, for example ideas, which have been appropriated
</I>&gt;<i> and commoditised by them who we now call owners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Because of this, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; monetary system is incapable of properly estimating the value of things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that are abundant or social.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. If it encodes scarcity it can not encode non-scarcity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, and this has been discussed before at length and was very aptly
</I>&gt;<i> summarized by Kevin Carson recently on the p2p foundation blog, there
</I>&gt;<i> exist many forms of money that do not assume scarcity. Mutual credit is
</I>&gt;<i> a very fine example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The assumption of scarcity is built into our current monetary system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At some point the lords realized that these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; commons were quite valuable, and suddenly realized that which has come
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to be known as the tragedy of the commons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the &quot;tragedy&quot; of the commons is of course capitalist propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is pretty obvious. It was not a tragedy but the appropriation at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the beginning of an era.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the way you put this. It's not entirely accurate, historically,
</I>&gt;<i> but I agree that the tragedy of the commons was capitalist propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i> The concept is itself pure bullshit, born out of rampant unchecked
</I>&gt;<i> Malthusianism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Usury, or interest, creates an interesting situation in the monetary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here your analysis starts to get wrong. Interest does not create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation in the monetary system but is created by a monetary system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the contrary. As Michel pointed out in his previous reply to this,
</I>&gt;<i> usury is by no means the norm. See my post to the Oekonux mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> on the 6. may 2009 for a theological overview of usury and its many bans
</I>&gt;<i> through time. See also how interest is not assumed in many currencies,
</I>&gt;<i> specifically LETS systems and many other alternative currencies. (In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, LETS systems have the absence of usury as a rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you probably mean is that usury comes into effect in monetary
</I>&gt;<i> systems because money lenders want increase or return on their loans,
</I>&gt;<i> and the competition isn't good enough to eliminate it. But the truth is
</I>&gt;<i> that state and/or central bank interference with the monetary system and
</I>&gt;<i> their monopoly over given monetary systems forces banks and other
</I>&gt;<i> lenders to charge increase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The means of production of money are in the hands of centralized
</I>&gt;<i> monopolies. If money could be produced by all, scarcity would not be
</I>&gt;<i> assumed, and market dynamics would make usury unreasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Simple: We stop assuming that everything is scarce, and that all things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; are rival.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But then: What do we need money for at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because money does not encode scarcity, it encodes trust, and by way of
</I>&gt;<i> that, it encodes merit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First, we stop accepting centralization of the means of production, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; allow everybody to create credit, the value of which is determined by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their merit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And merit is of course scarce. So you are introducing a new scarcity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the attempt to remove scarcity. This makes no sense. But it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflects how much your thinking is still bound to a scarcity based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system. I wholeheartedly suggest that you just look at peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production. Scarcity is no part of peer production. And thus money is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Merit is not scarce. It is finite, meaning that there is a limited
</I>&gt;<i> amount of it available, but it is not scarce in the sense that
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable use of merit will not deplete it. Further, merit is not
</I>&gt;<i> rival, so many people can make use of the same merit simultaneously
</I>&gt;<i> without causing deadlocks. Because of this, the dynamics of merit are
</I>&gt;<i> very much different from the dynamics of currencies defined completely
</I>&gt;<i> by central bank estimates of monetary value, or by market adaptations to
</I>&gt;<i> that value system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; By using computers we can make this fast, simple and safe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By using computers you move the authorities into the machine. Code is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; law - already forgotten? You can not remove authorities by moving them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into a computer program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am aware with Lawrence Lessig's statement to that affect. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with my reversal of it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Law is code
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seen from a software engineering perspective, the legal system is little
</I>&gt;<i> more than a piece of software that defines rules and heuristics that
</I>&gt;<i> determine the acceptable operational parameters of society. It is
</I>&gt;<i> self-modifying code in that it adapts on runtime to the output of the
</I>&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're not removing authority by putting it into a computer program.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather, we're acknowledging the existence of authority and the
</I>&gt;<i> structures that enforce it, and using computer technology as a modest
</I>&gt;<i> means of leveling out the playing field by using advanced mathematics to
</I>&gt;<i> give everybody the means of production of money. I personally wish I
</I>&gt;<i> could see an easy way to do it without computers, but unless we can
</I>&gt;<i> teach everybody to calculate RSA in their head, I can't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  &#339;&#244;&#242;&#252;Abundant cheap credit would drastically alter the balance of power
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; between capital and labor, and returns on labor would replace returns on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; capital as the dominant form of economic activity.&#339;&#244;&#242;&#253; - Kevin Carson,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Mutualist Political Economy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I never understood: When I can create as much money as I want -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which above is already impossible by the merit thing - for what do I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need money then at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Money is either scarce or it makes no sense. It follows that if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to overcome scarcity money makes no sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, wrong. Money encodes value, trust or merit. When I pay you for a
</I>&gt;<i> good, you are accepting that there is a high chance that you will be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use that payment's implicit trust statement to procure other
</I>&gt;<i> goods. This has NOTHING to do with scarcity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; strong encryption these statements will be nigh impossible to forge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are moving the policemen into the computer. Probably you also like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DRM methods - they are doing the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How the hell do you manage to equate strong encryption with DRM? That is
</I>&gt;<i> the most absurd thing I have heard, and it's also borderline offensive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, strong encryption eliminates the need for &quot;policemen&quot; by
</I>&gt;<i> providing everybody with a method of ensuring their privacy and proving
</I>&gt;<i> their identity. Notice how this e-mail will be digitally signed with my
</I>&gt;<i> PGP key when I send it; this is a mathematically strong way of helping
</I>&gt;<i> you be able to trust that the message is from me. There is no policing
</I>&gt;<i> involved, just a piece of smart mathematics coupled up with a p2p trust
</I>&gt;<i> model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DRM methods on the other hand aim to prevent the copying or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> realistic use of digital information, which is both impossible and
</I>&gt;<i> stupid. This has nothing to do with trust models: with DRM you have to
</I>&gt;<i> supply the user of the DRMed technology with both the product and the
</I>&gt;<i> key to unlock it, and then somehow make it impossible to use the key
</I>&gt;<i> outside of a certain context, which of course is impossible to enforce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Property is weaker now than often before, as it goes against the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; morality of those who have nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorry, but morality was always the same largely. So there is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but there are way more people who have nothing now than there
</I>&gt;<i> were a couple of years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The monetary system is weak now, because it was designed around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; assumptions that no longer apply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, when I look at the rate with which monetary systems are proposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can not really see that the monetary system is weak. In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contrary: At the point in history where money really becomes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; superfluos people are so shocked by this vision that they do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *everything* to save their old certainties. Sorry, but this is too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conservative for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please understand that &quot;monetary systems&quot; - plural, no article - is
</I>&gt;<i> different from &quot;the monetary system&quot; - singular, definite article.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we say &quot;the monetary system&quot; we are referring to the monetary
</I>&gt;<i> system that is currently being used throughout the world, which is a
</I>&gt;<i> fiat credit model with centralized credit authority, explicit usury and
</I>&gt;<i> implicit geographical bindings (in some cases more explicit than others).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anarchism is the future: freedom for all to live in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; equality and cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No. Anarchism is a concept related to capitalism. For instance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equality is a fundamental value in capitalist societies. Equality is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept to deal with scarcity and limitations. The future is peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production. Equality will simply be no topic any more in peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anarchism is related to capitalism in the way a kiwi is related to a
</I>&gt;<i> range rover. Sure, they're both political models, but that's where the
</I>&gt;<i> similarity ends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalism relies on property, and property generates inequality, as
</I>&gt;<i> does communism - with most implementations of communism being nothing
</I>&gt;<i> more than state capitalism. As Eben Moglen said anecdotally during a
</I>&gt;<i> talk yesterday at the University of Iceland: &quot;Under capitalism, man
</I>&gt;<i> exploits man. Under communism it's the other way around.&quot; (there's a
</I>&gt;<i> partial audio recording at <A HREF="http://notendur.hi.is/~annaj/audio/">http://notendur.hi.is/~annaj/audio/</A> btw)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, you claimed to be familiar with anarchism. Why then do you not
</I>&gt;<i> understand that anarchism is the political model for peer production,
</I>&gt;<i> and what we're dealing with is merely a technological phenotype?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can only appeal to all of you that you open your eyes and really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *watch* these things which happen all around us. And open you mind and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overcome this outdated thinking in money / scarcity categories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If you open your mind too much, your brain will fall out.&quot; -- Tim Minchin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're watching. Trust me, we are.
