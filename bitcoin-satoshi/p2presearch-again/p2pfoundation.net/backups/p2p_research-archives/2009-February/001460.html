<PRE>Dear Tere,

It's so bad that &quot;deletionpedia&quot; has better quality articles (in a
growing number of areas) at this point

See this in regards to corruption:
<A HREF="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/12/04/0333252.shtml?tid=267">http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/12/04/0333252.shtml?tid=267</A>

The fish rots from the head down.

Also, Jimmy Wales has a conflict of interest in running Wikia, a
commercial venture that aims to apply semantic web technology to a
wikipedia like service. Wikia was started after I had written about
applying semantic tech to Wikipedia itself. But he actually not only
applying the concept to a commercial for-profit venture but in doing
so he's sucking creative ideas away from wikipedia and funneling them
into what makes him money. Wikia now hosts &quot;semantic mediawiki&quot; which
was designed originally with the hope of its adoption by Wikipedia.
But on a more broader scale, Wales is leveraging wikipedia and his
status there to make money with Wikia. If no one else gets this, then
oh well... But I can write a 3 page article on it, easily with
researched facts and links.

</I>&gt;<i> Tere,

</I>&gt;<i> since you ask, here's the overview of the main arguments
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/is-something-fundamentally-wrong-with-wikipedia-governance-processes/2008/01/07">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/is-something-fundamentally-wrong-with-wikipedia-governance-processes/2008/01/07</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> point 4, 5 and 6 are key, and have only worsened since it was written,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm no longer optimistic, I think the Wikipedia's flawed governance is
</I>&gt;<i> beyond repair, there is no social force that could reform it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my key argument: after the victory of the deletionist created artificial
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity and therefore an allocation problem, but without any democratic
</I>&gt;<i> governance structure to accompany it, the problems became structurally
</I>&gt;<i> entrenched
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is something fundamentally wrong with Wikipedia governance processes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikipedia is often hailed as a prime example of peer production and peer
</I>&gt;<i> governance, an example of how a community can self-govern very complex
</I>&gt;<i> processes. Including by me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is also increasingly showing the dark side and pitfalls of purely
</I>&gt;<i> informal approaches, especially when they scale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia is particularly vulnerable because its work is not done in teams,
</I>&gt;<i> but by individuals with rather weak links. At the same time it is also a
</I>&gt;<i> very complex project, with consolidating social norms and rules, and with an
</I>&gt;<i> elite that knows them, vs. many occasional page writers who are ignorant of
</I>&gt;<i> them. When that system then instaures a scarcity rule, articles have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &#226;&#8364;&#732;notable&quot; or they can be deleted. It creates a serious imbalance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the Wikipedia remains a remarkable achievement, and escapes any easy
</I>&gt;<i> characterization of its qualities because of its sheer vastness, there must
</I>&gt;<i> indeed be hundreds of thousands of volunteers doing good work on articles,
</I>&gt;<i> it has also created a power structure, but it is largely invisible, opaque,
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore particularly vulnerable to the well-known tyranny of
</I>&gt;<i> structurelessness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the orginal thoughts of Jo Freeman:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a
</I>&gt;<i> 'structureless' group. Any group of people of whatever nature coming
</I>&gt;<i> together for any length of time, for any purpose, will inevitably structure
</I>&gt;<i> itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible, it may vary over
</I>&gt;<i> time, it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over
</I>&gt;<i> the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities,
</I>&gt;<i> personalities and intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we
</I>&gt;<i> are individuals with different talents, predispositions and backgrounds
</I>&gt;<i> makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever could we approximate 'structurelessness' and that is not the
</I>&gt;<i> nature of a human group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider also this warning:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every group of people with an unusual goal - good, bad, or silly - will
</I>&gt;<i> trend toward the cult attractor unless they make a constant effort to resist
</I>&gt;<i> it. You can keep your house cooler than the outdoors, but you have to run
</I>&gt;<i> the air conditioner constantly, and as soon as you turn off the electricity
</I>&gt;<i> - give up the fight against entropy - things will go back to &quot;normal&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the same sense that every thermal differential wants to equalize itself,
</I>&gt;<i> and every computer program wants to become a collection of ad-hoc patches,
</I>&gt;<i> every Cause wants to be a cult. It's a high-entropy state into which the
</I>&gt;<i> system trends, an attractor in human psychology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cultishness is quantitative, not qualitative. The question is not &quot;Cultish,
</I>&gt;<i> yes or no?&quot; but &quot;How much cultishness and where?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikicult website asserts that this stage has already been reached:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the systems, policies, procedures, committees, councils, processes and
</I>&gt;<i> appointed authorities that run Wikipedia, a lot of intrinsic power goes
</I>&gt;<i> around. While most serious contributors devotedly continue to contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> the implied idealism, there are those with the communication and political
</I>&gt;<i> skill to place themselves in the right place at the right time and establish
</I>&gt;<i> even more apparent power. Out of these, a cabal inevitably forms; the rest,
</I>&gt;<i> as they say, is history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specialized sites have sprung up, such as the Wikipedia Review, monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> power abuse in general, or in particular cases
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikipedia Review offers an interesting summary of the various criticisms
</I>&gt;<i> that have been leveled agains the Wikipedia, which I'm reproducing here
</I>&gt;<i> below, but I'm adding links that document these processes as well. Spend
</I>&gt;<i> some time on reading the allegations, their documentation, and make up your
</I>&gt;<i> own mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My conclusion though is that major reforms will be needed to insure the
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia governance is democratic and remains so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Wikipedia disrespects and disregards scholars, experts, scientists, and
</I>&gt;<i> others with special knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wikipedia specifically disregards authors with special knowledge,
</I>&gt;<i> expertise, or credentials. There is no way for a real scholar to distinguish
</I>&gt;<i> himself or herself from a random anonymous editor merely claiming scholarly
</I>&gt;<i> credentials, and thus no claim of credentials is typically believed. Even
</I>&gt;<i> when credentials are accepted, Wikipedia affords no special regard for
</I>&gt;<i> expert editors contributing in their fields. This has driven most expert
</I>&gt;<i> editors away from editing Wikipedia in their fields. Similarly, Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> implements no controls that distinguish mature and educated editors from
</I>&gt;<i> immature and uneducated ones.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Critique of Wikipedia's open source ideology, as opposed to free software
</I>&gt;<i> principles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Wikipedia's culture of anonymous editing and administration results in a
</I>&gt;<i> lack of responsible authorship and management.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wikipedia editors may contribute as IP addresses, or as an ever-changing
</I>&gt;<i> set of pseudonyms. There is thus no way of determining conflicts of
</I>&gt;<i> interest, canvassing, or other misbehaviour in article editing. Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;<i> adminsitrators are similarly anonymous, shielding them from scrutiny for
</I>&gt;<i> their actions. They additionally can hide the history of their editing (or
</I>&gt;<i> that of others).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Wikipedia's administrators have become an entrenched and over-powerful
</I>&gt;<i> elite, unresponsive and harmful to authors and contributors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Without meaningful checks and balances on administrators, administrative
</I>&gt;<i> abuse is the norm, rather than the exception, with blocks and bans being
</I>&gt;<i> enforced by fiat and whim, rather than in implementation of policy. Many
</I>&gt;<i> well-meaning editors have been banned simply on suspicion of being
</I>&gt;<i> previously banned users, without any transgression, while others have been
</I>&gt;<i> banned for disagreeing with a powerful admin&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s editorial point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no clear-cut code of ethics for administrators, no truly
</I>&gt;<i> independent process leading to blocks and bans, no process for appeal that
</I>&gt;<i> is not corrupted by the imbalance of power between admin and blocked editor,
</I>&gt;<i> and no process by which administrators are reviewed regularly for
</I>&gt;<i> misbehaviour.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overview of developments
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The blog Nonbovine ruminations critically monitors Wikipedia governance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikipedia has stopped growing because of the deletionists: Andrew Lih ;
</I>&gt;<i> Slate
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia's abusive bio-deletion process: case by Tony Judge
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Wikipedia's numerous policies and procedures are not enforced equally on
</I>&gt;<i> the community, popular or powerful editors are often exempted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Administrators, in particular, and former administrators, are frequently
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to trangress (or change!) Wikipedia's numerous policies, such as
</I>&gt;<i> those prohibiting personal attacks, prohibiting the release of personal
</I>&gt;<i> information about editors, and those prohibiting collusion in editing.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The undemocratic practices of its investigative committee
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A personal experience
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The badsites list of censored sites belonging to Wikipedia's enemies
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lack of transparency and accountability
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Judd Bagley case
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> InformationLiberation on Wikipedia's totalitarian universe
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Wikipedia's quasi-judicial body, the Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) is at
</I>&gt;<i> best incompetent and at worst corrupt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ArbCom holds secret proceedings, refuses to be bound by precedent, operates
</I>&gt;<i> on non-existant or unwritten rules, and does not allow equal access to all
</I>&gt;<i> editors. It will reject cases that threaten to undermine the Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> status quo or that would expose powerful administrators to sanction, and
</I>&gt;<i> will move slowly or not at all (in public) on cases it is discussing in
</I>&gt;<i> private.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Monitoring of ArbCom's activities
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary of criticisms
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The case of the secret mailing list for top insiders
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), the organization legally responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia, is opaque, is poorly managed, and is insufficiently independent
</I>&gt;<i> from Wikipedia's remaining founder and his business interests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The WMF lacks a mechanism to address the concerns of outsiders, resulting
</I>&gt;<i> in an insular and socially irresponsible internal culture. Because of
</I>&gt;<i> inadequate oversight and supervision, Wikimedia has hired incompetent and
</I>&gt;<i> (in at least one case) criminal employees. Jimmy Wales for-profit business
</I>&gt;<i> Wikia benefits in numerous ways from its association with the non-profit
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Foundation's budget
