<PRE>Hi Patrick,

I think I follow your argument.  What about when we are dealing with a
commons (as many wikis can be understood)?  There is no owner, and no sale
of goods, as far as I can see.  How would you interpret that situation
within your theory?

Best,
Matt

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matt,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since communities are dynamic* across time, insuring members remain
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;actual and only owners&quot; of the Material Means of Production needs
</I>&gt;<i> a non-static solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This temporal complexity requires we consider factors that are
</I>&gt;<i> traditionally outside the scope of limitations for simple property
</I>&gt;<i> ownership.  While regular property ownership can be a stepping-stone
</I>&gt;<i> toward such an organization, there is also a 'bad' side to ownership
</I>&gt;<i> that we must guard against lest we arrive in the typical centralized
</I>&gt;<i> configuration...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have identified the primary factor in need of adjustment, and credit
</I>&gt;<i> most of that 'generalizing' the concepts of User Freedom as outlined
</I>&gt;<i> by Richard Stallman, and specifically the requirement that Object
</I>&gt;<i> Users (Product Consumers) gain &quot;at cost&quot; access to the Sources
</I>&gt;<i> (Material Means) of that product even when they do NOT know how to
</I>&gt;<i> 'operate' those Sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Observe that 'Profit' (literally &quot;Consumer Price&quot; - &quot;Owner Costs&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> arises only when the Consumer does not yet have enough Ownership.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example: when you own an apple tree, you might pay workers to tend it,
</I>&gt;<i> but those wages are but a cost that any Owner must pay.  But every
</I>&gt;<i> Owner is able to 'escape' the payment of profit - for who would they
</I>&gt;<i> pay it to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, when a current Owner/Member sells something to someone else that
</I>&gt;<i> has insufficient ownership, that Owner has the 'opportunity' to charge
</I>&gt;<i> a price above cost (to profit).  [[remember, Wages are not Profit,
</I>&gt;<i> Wages are a Cost of production]].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if such a community allows Profit to be treated as a 'reward' for
</I>&gt;<i> that current owner (as Capitalism does), then that current owner will
</I>&gt;<i> aquire even *more* property as he invests that profit into more
</I>&gt;<i> Material Means of Production, while the Consumer who made that
</I>&gt;<i> overpayment will be left with nothing but the product he overpaid for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Profit can be thought of as a &quot;plea for growth&quot; from the Consumer who
</I>&gt;<i> paid it.  It is the Consumer's dependence upon the current Owners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He is saying &quot;look, I'll pay you more than it really cost (costs
</I>&gt;<i> include wages) to make this beer because I don't own the equipment,
</I>&gt;<i> and am not organized enough to hire those with the skills - otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> I could get it &quot;at cost&quot;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying we shouldn't charge Profit (for to do so would stop
</I>&gt;<i> growth altogether), but only that profit should be understood as a
</I>&gt;<i> measure of consumer dependence that needs to be 'balanced' if we are
</I>&gt;<i> to remain &quot;Member Managed&quot; - for otherwise only the originators will
</I>&gt;<i> Own (and therefore manage), while the latecomers will be a dependent
</I>&gt;<i> group that can only beg for recognition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In conclusion: While real property ownership appears to be a direct
</I>&gt;<i> solution to &quot;Member Managed&quot; problem, it is incomplete unless &quot;price
</I>&gt;<i> above cost&quot; (profit) is treated as an investment from the Consumer who
</I>&gt;<i> paid it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;<i> (*) Some of the dynamism we must consider:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) The total number of members grows and shrinks as members join or leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) Members desire different *types* of &quot;goods and services&quot; which may
</I>&gt;<i> require the purchase of different (more) Material Means of Production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) Members desire different quantities of &quot;goods and services&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> requires their ownership rise and fall to match their consumption.
