<PRE>&lt;&lt;
Are you saying there is not enough benefit from co-ownership to make
it worth these complexities?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Not at all. Co-ownership is a choice people should be able to make just like
any other choice.

But people should be able to decide between collective and individual choice
making or other types of choice making.

So I may choose individual choice fr one thing and collective choice for
another thing, even completely arbitrarily. It's my choice.

In the immaterial world of digital content, ownership has zero meaning.
Maybe that is because digital content is abundant and if open software
production (and open software as a product) is made sustainably abundant
(see one proposal on 'discussion tab' of the P2P Energy Economy wiki) then
we will get rid of ownership both explicit and implicit (the corporations
that fund free software production basically are the implicit owners, e.g.
Google and Firefox. Google even hired the top talent from Firefox team to
work on Chrome!!! so they can have even more control over the browser)

So we need to move toward systems that enable sustainable abundance as much
as possible. It's a uniting theme and one that makes a lot of sense
analytically and politically, although it's perceived as 'new age nonsense'
by most people who cannot think for themselves and are stuck to the idea
that scarcity is only natural, when in fact the biggest reasons for scarcity
are the way human economy is designed and the fact that everyone assumes
that it's the way it has to be. In other words, we're running against eons
of ingrained assumptions on the other side... So we need to simplify the
argument and recognize the paces where people are hurting (e.g. interest and
gambling) and start rallying people against those two 'evils' ... a moral
revolution not an intellectual one.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you saying there is not enough benefit from co-ownership to make

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I say &quot;co-ownership&quot; I am talking about some group choosing to
</I>&gt;<i> invest and hold some physical property for their own benefit.  I'm NOT
</I>&gt;<i> talking about every human on Earth having a say in that investment -
</I>&gt;<i> only those who paid would have a say (a vote), and that vote would
</I>&gt;<i> naturally be weighted by the amount of ownership they paid for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some examples that already occur:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Some people joint-purchase an RV (Motor Home) so they can pay only
</I>&gt;<i> costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) People used to co-own vacation homes before the Time-Share
</I>&gt;<i> industry organized to take that over for the purpose of charging more
</I>&gt;<i> than cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) Co-purchasing an airplane allows the group of owners to share it
</I>&gt;<i> amongst themselves - hiring a pilot to operate it if necessary, but
</I>&gt;<i> realizing great savings compared to rental.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Co-ownership allows each of us to invest in industry that would
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise be out of reach because of financial constraints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The capitalists are already using the strength of co-ownership against
</I>&gt;<i> us when the joint-invest in for-profit corporations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without co-ownership we will be forced to do everything on our own,
</I>&gt;<i> without any intradependence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Capitalists will infiltrate any community we try to establish -
</I>&gt;<i> just as they currently do - when they buy the land, water rights,
</I>&gt;<i> networks, restaurants, meeting places, grocery stores, shopping malls,
</I>&gt;<i> farms, factories, etc. that are more efficiently owned by more than
</I>&gt;<i> one person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once they own that infrastructure, and if we are not &quot;pushing against
</I>&gt;<i> it&quot; by organizing and co-owning for ourselves, then we will be overrun
</I>&gt;<i> as usual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Single-ownership is important for Personal property, but for as long
</I>&gt;<i> as we continue to resist solving this problem we will be at the mercy
</I>&gt;<i> of those that use it against us.
