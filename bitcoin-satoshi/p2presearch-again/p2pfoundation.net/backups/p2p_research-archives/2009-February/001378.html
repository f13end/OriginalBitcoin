<PRE>A little rewording never hurt anyone :-)
An Economy for Human Beings, Not Insects

Most insects are designed to be specialized.

Most humans are designed to be generalists.

But in today's economy, most humans are taught to behave exactly like
insects.

The economic and globalization theories in use today (which are based in
part on Adam Smith's antiquated treatise) encourage specialization.

They say let India be the IT provider and let the USA be the creative force.
This pattern of specialization is fractal in that it is reflected in each
part within such specialized economies, including the USA, where the
majority of organizations are highly matrixed containers (or bee hives) of
worker bees, with true generalists competing for the one and only true
generalist position, that of the queen bee.

As to why there aren't more true generalists in today's organizations, those
who happen to be true generalists but are not &quot;controlling&quot; AND
&quot;manipulative&quot; enough to hold power over their own peers, find no place in
the bee hive unless they demonstrate a particular specialized skill, which
turns them into specialists, and while they may continue to think of
themselves as generalists, they are rewarded according to a specific set of
goals, which continuously moves them away from generalization and into
greater degree of specialization.

Thus, the only truly autonomous (or free) bees in today's economy are the
self-governing bees roaming freely on their own outside the bee hive, i.e.
without a hive of their own, but such self-governing peers are greatly
disempowered by the design of today's economy.

There is an ideological movement today that promotes the idea of one being
their own queen bee by being a self sufficient entity with no critical
dependencies. Yet, as argued in the previous section true autonomy can only
be achieved through increased inter-dependence between equally empowered
peers (see: Increased Autonomy Through Increased Inter-Dependence.)

Since every peer in the P2P Energy Economy is equally empowered as a
producer of energy, goods and service, and since the system promotes maximum
inter-dependence, everyone is guaranteed a level of security that is based
on their work energy, efficiency and creativity, so no one should need to
work _for_ someone else.

However, peers with energy surplus, goods or services needed for the
production of other goods or services by others may equitably exchange their
surplus energy, goods or services with peers who need them (to get the goods
and services they need for themselves and those they need for producing
their own goods and services,)

Since, when trading, peers are matched automatically and anonymously per the
buying peer's search criteria, selling peer's lender credits, and the
affinity in social, ecological and environmental values between the peers,
ad-hoc production hierarchies, with equally empowered members, are
constantly formed and dissolved.

Therefore, the P2P Energy Economy empowers every peer to be their own queen
bee by continuously breaking the hive structure and by promoting increased
inter-dependence between equally empowered peers.
