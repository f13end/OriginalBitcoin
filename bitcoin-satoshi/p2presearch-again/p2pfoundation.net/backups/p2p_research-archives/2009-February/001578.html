FYI - the new conference of Chaos Computer Club, more on politics and less
on geekdom. I've been asked to invite foreign colleagues from the NGO
world. Some travel funding is available for speakers. CU there?

SIGINT.ccc.de &lt;<A HREF="http://sigint.ccc.de/">http://sigint.ccc.de/</A>&gt; 2009 Call for Proposals

Friday May 22nd through Sunday May 24th, 2009

Komed, Im Mediapark, Cologne, Germany

<A HREF="http://events.ccc.de/sigint/2009">http://events.ccc.de/sigint/2009</A>

Important Dates

   * CFP Submission Deadline March 27th, 2009
   * Early Acceptance Notifications March 29th, 2009
   * Presenter Notification by April 19th, 2009
   * Schedule finalized by May 1st, 2009

Purpose and Scope

SIGINT is a conference on discourse in the digital age, brought to you by
the Chaos Computer Club, one of the biggest and most influential hacker
organizations in Europe. Its stated purpose is to bring together,
surprise, and enlighten those interested in playful and clever
interactions with computers, networks, art, politics, and society. SIGINT
is about participation and making the world a better place. The conference
takes place in Cologne, Germany, in close proximity to the Ruhr area in
Western Germany and not far from the borders of the Netherlands, Belgium,
and Luxemburg.

The name SIGINT stands for intelligence-gathering by interception of
signals in the world of secret services and should also be immediately
recognized as short for &quot;signal interrupt&quot; by Unix geeks -- just grep for
SIGINT in /usr/include/asm/signal.h in your Linux source. No matter what
angle you look at it from, SIGINT the conference is about meaningful
signals in the stream of information, about what is relevant and what is
entropy and chaos.

SIGINT will feature invited talks, keynotes, and performances. Discussions
and workshops will get every participant involved throughout the day.
However, we also want you to contribute your ideas for talks and send in
your submissions!

Each of the three days of SIGINT has a theme. Submissions should be
related to one of the themes.

Day 1: Control and Surveillance

We would love to hear about international security architectures and the
emerging &quot;Homeland Security Industrial Complex&quot; in the EU, deep packet
inspection at ISPs, Internet censorship, crowd control and surveillance
technology, philosophical reflections on the shift from the disciplinary
society to the society of control, data retention, and state repression.
The first day is on the state of society and its tendencies of control.

Day 2: Pranks, Bugs, and Insecurities

We want submissions on the hacking of and interventions in urban spaces,
anonymity and pseudonymity hacks, creative pranks for your computer and
those of others, embarrassing security holes, hacktivism, and safe havens
for hackers and pirates. The second day is the antithesis to the first day
and celebrates deviants in society with their tactics and lifestyles
against the current mainstream idea of security.

Day 3: The Future of Everything

We want to hear about promising and disturbing visions of the future, from
genetic hacking to the post-copyright society, 3D printers, new forms of
democracy, the changing roles of privacy and individuality, robots and
human rights, and a critique of the current economy. The third day
concludes the conference. We are interested in answers to pressing
problems, but we also want to hear new questions asked.

Proposal Submission

All proposals must be submitted online using our online lecture submission
system at <A HREF="https://cccv.pentabarf.org/submission/SIGINT09.">https://cccv.pentabarf.org/submission/SIGINT09.</A> Please follow

submission, feel free to contact us at <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">sigint09 at cccv.de</A> but do NOT submit
your lecture via e-mail.

Please make sure to include the following information in your submission:

   * Your name or a handle or pseudonym if you would like to be referred
to by that instead of your real name on our website and publications.
   * A title for your proposal.
   * A brief biography of you or your group as it pertains to your work.
   * The theme of the day your proposal is related to
   * A picture of yourself
   * Brief description/abstract explaining in detail what you will be
performing or presenting on. 150 WORDS OR LESS. NO EXCEPTIONS.
   * A more verbose explanation of your topic
   * Any additional A/V needs you may have over and above what we provide
   * A reliable email address that you can be reached at

Conference languages are German and English. We will provide
interpretation services, so please hand in your submission in the language
you feel most comfortable in.

Venue and Facilities

SIGINT takes place at the Komed conference center at Cologne's Mediapark.
Beautifully located next to a lake, the Mediapark is in the center of the
city. Two modern buildings offer space for presentations and room for ideas.

The main presentation spaces will each be equipped with at least the
following equipment/accessibility:

   * A laptop computer (you may bring your own if you like)
   * LCD projector with a standard VGA input (Note to Mac users: please
bring a converter)
   * Projection screen or sheet
   * Whiteboard and markers or other appropriate writing surface
   * Microphone and audio line-in as well as small PA system
   * A video and audio recording of your presentation
   * At least one power outlet for your use

If you have a need for something not listed above, make sure to let us
know in your proposal. We can likely provide most A/V equipment if it's
necessary.

Notification of Acceptance and Reimbursements

Presenters will be notified by April 19th 2009.

SIGINT is a non-profit oriented event and speakers are not paid. However,
financial help on travel expenses and accommodation is possible. It needs
to be agreed upon after acceptance of the submission though. Don't be shy
and state your requirements in the application when submitting your
lecture and we'll work something out!
