<PRE>Marc,

I wonder if your example is a good one,

what you describe has high transaction and uncertainty costs, and I think
this is why people rely on trust networks, or on hierarchical
recommendations or filtering systems, etc ...

But I think that ancient and medieval systems of democracy relied on random
elections, as schemes to make sure that power would not accrue,

however, I'm not an expert in these alternative schemes

</I>&gt;<i> You can have a functional hierarchy (not a political one that keeps
</I>&gt;<i> power at the top) between equally empowered peers where the structure
</I>&gt;<i> of the hierarchy is known but where the nodes are occupied by randomly
</I>&gt;<i> picked peers from a set of all peers that meet a given functional
</I>&gt;<i> criteria.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In such a hierarchy, all the peers are equally empowered AND no
</I>&gt;<i> built-in dependency is created on any peer in particular.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would such hierarchy be known as?  It exists today due to Search
</I>&gt;<i> technology. When someone running some business goes out to find
</I>&gt;<i> suppliers they go to Google and search for e.g. Python developer. They
</I>&gt;<i> find tons of links. They pick one or pick one that leads them to
</I>&gt;<i> another search engine which ultimately leads them to some supplier.
</I>&gt;<i> Now we have a hierarchy of two levels: the business owner and the
</I>&gt;<i> supplier. If the business owner repeats this every time she needs a
</I>&gt;<i> Python developer, which some people do, and uses the same criteria but
</I>&gt;<i> picks another supplier from the range of all potential suppliers
</I>&gt;<i> (those matching the criteria) then that is power to the business owner
</I>&gt;<i> and power to the developer. Neither is stuck with each other, and
</I>&gt;<i> neither develops a dependency on each other. I ran a number of
</I>&gt;<i> projects like that in the past with higher reliability than depending
</I>&gt;<i> on the same developer for all projects. Every developer had to prove
</I>&gt;<i> themselves and I had to prove my ability to manage the project.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks David,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; David Graeber has written a whole book examining 'value' throughout
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different (anthropological) societies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the other David must have had the same experience as me during my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; university years, I was explicitely taught the barter-leads-to-market
</I>&gt;<i> story,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with no mention at all of the gift economy, a notion I only encountered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years ago. Perhaps neoclassical economists have evolved over time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrated other types of knowledge ..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still, there is a difference between saying, early economies had barter,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which was complicated, so they invented tokens which became money and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ultimately resulted in capitalism and the other story which is: we had
</I>&gt;<i> gift
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economies, but when force intervened, we created debt, which eventually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resulted in the necessity of inventing money ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether force is constituent to the human experience, even before the
</I>&gt;<i> advent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of unequal class societies, is  perhaps difficult to resolve, but I tend
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that it is inherent to the human condition; this is why I think
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state cannot be simply abolished, and I'm not an anarchist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are right about 'economies' being a misleading term, and I have read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remarks of Graeber in the same sense, it's an industrial concept we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projecting backwards, but perhaps also a distinction we have learned to
</I>&gt;<i> see;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I think it is okay to use by analogy, as long as we know its
</I>&gt;<i> limitations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This brings me to the crux of the debate: the role of networks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like hierarchies, and markets, I do not see them in a univocal way.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hierarchies can be feudal, or meritocratic; markets can be capitalist, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not; and similarly for networks: they cannot be divorced from the class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure of society, even as they have their own 'independent' effect of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; society which adapt these forms. But these forms will be thoroughly
</I>&gt;<i> adapted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and changed through the process of differential adoption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, my view is the following: networks first arose for the privileged
</I>&gt;<i> elite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through private networks (multinationals and such), then became
</I>&gt;<i> democratized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and peer to peer. This leads to widespread adoption of new economic,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political and social practices, which are more productive in many ways
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the earlier modes. Hence, peer production, governance and property, as 3
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modes. As more productive ways of doing things, they are not only
</I>&gt;<i> practiced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the bottom of society, but by all sectors, which initially use them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within the existing dominant mode, just as early capitalist practices
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used to strengthen an ailing feudal order. But as it is adapted it also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes the order, and new social forces are organizing around it.
</I>&gt;<i> Chiefly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the knowledge workers and other associated producers on one hand, but
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I call 'netarchical capitalists', who created new forms of activity
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; business based on 'enabling and empowering social production'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As our infinite growth mechanism is hitting its limits, it is groping for
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change towards markets which include former externalities (green
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capitalism), but also realizing it can't be done, or much less
</I>&gt;<i> effectively,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without adopting much wider participatory practices (co-creation,
</I>&gt;<i> co-design,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crowdsourcing, peer production and sharing modes of all kinds), hence,
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; force of the new modes of peer production, governance and property are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; growing, from emergence to eventual equivalence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the current infinite growth system succeeds in being a natural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capitalism, that may be the end of the story, otherwise, a phase
</I>&gt;<i> transition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will eventual occur, with the former core mode becoming a subsystem in a
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meta-system based on peer to peer dynamics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will this totally eliminate force? I do not think so, but it may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; significantly reduce their centrality to social life. But we can already
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that successful networks or peer production efforts also deal with
</I>&gt;<i> threats
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to their existence, i.e. to violence directed at them (even if through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spamming, trolling, etc...). So there are three elements to network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production: 1) enabling participation; 2) finding mechanisms for
</I>&gt;<i> selection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of excellence that are no threat to that universal participation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; availability; and 3) defense against threats.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; many thanks, michel, for including me on this.  but i find it confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  i also find it confused, for i think the author is conflating.  i'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; aware that any major social theorist has grandly claimed that societies
</I>&gt;<i> once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; had economies based solely on barter.  that barter may have been an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; important element, yes.  and that barter preceded money, yes.  but
</I>&gt;<i> that's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; narrower and different kind of claim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; perhaps there are economists who claim that barter came first, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; conceptual hinge for them may be that, from their perspective, economies
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not exist unless material trade is taking place.  however, the
</I>&gt;<i> economists i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; happened to see at lunch today, though not historians, saw no particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason to start economic history with barter, and a couple thought it
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; start with gifts, esp if the gifts had an exchange aspect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but that raises another matter.  early tribes depend significantly on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gifting.  we've agreed on that before, citing mauss in particular, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; graeber seems to be in agreement too.  but are we really talking about a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;gift economy&quot; with ancient tribes.  not exactly.  especially not if
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is no economy per se that is separable from what else goes on in a
</I>&gt;<i> tribe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  and particularly not if the purpose of the gifting is to create
</I>&gt;<i> honorable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; relationships and social solidarity, rather than just to engage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; potentially equal material exchanges.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but perhaps i'm not seeing the point you wanted me to see.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in any case, i took a look at his long article and something else caught
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; my eye:  he claims that &quot;neither states nor markets can exist without
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; constant threat of force.&quot;  he repeats this at various points, once or
</I>&gt;<i> twice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; referring to &quot;societies&quot; instead of &quot;states&quot; since &quot;Societies' are
</I>&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; states.&quot;  i'd question this, but i'd rather raise another point:  tribes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; also have not existed without the threat of force.  tribes often get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; idealized, perhaps especially by people fed up with states/hierarchies
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; markets.  but tribes can turn out to be as based on force and violence
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; other forms of organization.  if the author were to add this to his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; analysis, i wonder where it would lead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which leads to a question:  what about the kinds of information-age
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; networks that you and i are hopefully counting on?  as an emerging form
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; organization, they look marvelous and necessary (in my timn view, as
</I>&gt;<i> much so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; as tribes, hierarchies, and markets).  but their present-day emergence
</I>&gt;<i> is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in many areas, tied to the nature of force.  and some networks may turn
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in practice, once embedded in future multiform societies, to reflect the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; roles of force, even though many networks will be directed at the public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; good.  does this end up meaning that all forms of societal organization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; depend, to some extent, on the possibility of force?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; just a thought.  and i'm not entirely sure about it.  but it relates to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some propositions for the timn framework i'm trying to develop.  i'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; eventually get around to elaborating.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; meanwhile, i'll leave you with two quotes i happen to have handy that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; relate a bit to all this and get at contrasting dynamics that underlie
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; civilization (though i'm not sure the author above approves much of what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; others know as civilization):
