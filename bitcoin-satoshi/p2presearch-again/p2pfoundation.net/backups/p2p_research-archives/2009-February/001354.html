<PRE>Vinay,

any chance that you formulate this in a reaction I can post?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This is one of the most riveting and interesting essays I have read in a
</I>&gt;<i> long while. I strongly recommend it as a indispensable must-read.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This essay by Mike Davis has two parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the first, Pessimism of the Intellect, he reviews the evidence for
</I>&gt;<i> climate change, as well as attempts to change the situation and finds that
</I>&gt;<i> most worst-case scenarios imagined by the scientists have already been
</I>&gt;<i> exceeded, which means that we may have already reached the tipping point
</I>&gt;<i> which makes dislocation inevitable. Because the solution would demand an
</I>&gt;<i> enlightened reaction by the privileged, it is highly unlikely that the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary changes will take place. In fact, there is evidence that the
</I>&gt;<i> elites are already preparing lifeboat scenarios for their entrenched
</I>&gt;<i> survival amidst global chaos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the second part, the author switches to the Optimism of the Imagination
</I>&gt;<i> and finds an unlikely possibility: the greening and democratic reform of
</I>&gt;<i> city life. He outlines both the negative and positive aspects of cities from
</I>&gt;<i> an environmental point of view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Here are the positive ones:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *urban growth preserves open space and vital natural systems*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *well-defined boundaries between city and preserved countryside;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *waste is recycled, not exported downstream*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *strict regulation of automobile use*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *environmental economies of scale in transportation and residential
</I>&gt;<i> construction;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *the substitution of public luxury for privatized consumption;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *the socialization of desire and identity within public space;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *affordable access to city centers from periphery*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *egalitarian public services*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *large domains of public or non-profit housing*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *ethnic and income heterogeneity at fractal scales of city*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *powerful capacities for progressive taxation and planning in the public
</I>&gt;<i> interest*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *high levels of political mobilization and civic participation*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *public landscapes designed with children, seniors and special needs in
</I>&gt;<i> mind*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *rich dialectics of neighborhood and world culture;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *the priority of civic memory over proprietary icon;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *spatial integration of work, recreation and home-life.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Mike Davis:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Such sharp demarcations between 'good' and 'bad' features of city life
</I>&gt;<i> are redolent of famous attempts in the previous century to distill a
</I>&gt;<i> canonical urbanism or anti-urbanism: Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs, Frank
</I>&gt;<i> Lloyd Wright and Walt Disney, Corbusier and the CIAM manifesto, the 'New
</I>&gt;<i> Urbanism' of Andres Duany and Peter Calthorpe, and so on. But no one needs
</I>&gt;<i> 'urban theorists' to have eloquent opinions about virtues and vices of the
</I>&gt;<i> urban built environments and the kinds of social interactions they foster or
</I>&gt;<i> discourage. Especially here in Munich, with a rich conjugation of different
</I>&gt;<i> periods and conditions.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What often goes unnoticed in such moral inventories, however, is the
</I>&gt;<i> consistent affinity between social and environment justice, between the
</I>&gt;<i> communal ethos and a greener urbanism. Their mutual attraction is magnetic
</I>&gt;<i> if not inevitable. The conservation of urban green spaces and waterscapes,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, serves simultaneously to preserve vital natural elements of
</I>&gt;<i> urban metabolism while providing leisure and cultural resources for the
</I>&gt;<i> popular classes. Reducing suburban gridlock with better planning and more
</I>&gt;<i> public transit turns traffic sewers back into neighborhood streets while
</I>&gt;<i> reducing greenhouse emissions.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *There are innumerable examples and they all point toward to a single
</I>&gt;<i> unifying principle: namely, that the cornerstone of the low-carbon city, far
</I>&gt;<i> more than any particular green design or technology, is the priority given
</I>&gt;<i> to public affluence over private wealth. As we all know, several additional
</I>&gt;<i> Earths would be required to allow all of humanity to live in a suburban
</I>&gt;<i> house with two cars and a lawn, and this obvious constraint is sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> evoked to justify the impossibility of reconciling finite resources with
</I>&gt;<i> rising standards of living. Most contemporary cities, in rich countries or
</I>&gt;<i> poor, repress the potential environmental efficiencies inherent in human
</I>&gt;<i> settlement density. The ecological genius of the city remains a vast,
</I>&gt;<i> largely hidden power.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *But there is no planetary shortage of 'carrying capacity' if we are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to make democratic public space, rather than modular, private
</I>&gt;<i> consumption, the engine of sustainable equality. Public affluence -
</I>&gt;<i> represented by great urban parks, free museums, libraries, and infinite
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities for human interaction - represents an alternative route to a
</I>&gt;<i> rich standard of life based on earth-friendly, carnivalesque sociality.
</I>&gt;<i> Although seldom noticed by academic urban theorists, university campuses are
</I>&gt;<i> often little quasi-socialist paradises around rich public spaces for
</I>&gt;<i> learning, research, performance, and human reproduction.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The utopian ecological critique of the modern city was pioneered by
</I>&gt;<i> socialists and anarchists, beginning with Guild Socialism's dream
</I>&gt;<i> (influenced by the bioregionalist ideas of Kropotkin, and later, Geddes) of
</I>&gt;<i> garden cities for re-artisanized English workers, and ending with the
</I>&gt;<i> bombardment of the Karl-Marx-Hauf - Red Vienna's great experiment in
</I>&gt;<i> communal living - during the Austrian Civil War in 1934. In between are the
</I>&gt;<i> invention of the kibbutz by Russian and Polish socialist, the modernist
</I>&gt;<i> social housing projects of the Bauhaus, and the extraordinary debate over
</I>&gt;<i> urbanism conducted in the Soviet Union during the 1920s.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This radical urban imagination was a victim of the tragedies of the 1930s
</I>&gt;<i> and 1940s. Stalinism, on one hand, veered toward a monumentalism in
</I>&gt;<i> architecture and art, inhumane in scale and texture, that was little
</I>&gt;<i> different from the Wagnerian hyperboles of Albert Speer in the Third Reich.
</I>&gt;<i> Postwar Social Democracy, on the other hand, abandoned alternative urbanism
</I>&gt;<i> for a Keynesian mass housing policy that emphasized economies of scale in
</I>&gt;<i> high-rise projects on cheap suburban estates, and thereby uprooted
</I>&gt;<i> traditional working-class urban identities.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Yet the late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth century conversations
</I>&gt;<i> about the 'socialist city' provide invaluable starting points for thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about the current planetary crisis. Consider, for example, the
</I>&gt;<i> Constructivists. El Lissitzy, Melnikov, Leonidov, Golosov and the Vesnin
</I>&gt;<i> brothers are probably not familiar names, but these brilliant socialist
</I>&gt;<i> designers - constrained by early Soviet urban misery and a drastic shortage
</I>&gt;<i> of public investment - proposed to relieve congested apartment life with
</I>&gt;<i> splendidly designed workers clubs, people's theaters, and sports complexes.
</I>&gt;<i> They gave urgent priority to the emancipation of proletarian women through
</I>&gt;<i> the organization of communal kitchens, day nurseries, public baths, and
</I>&gt;<i> cooperatives of all kinds. Although they envisioned workers clubs and social
</I>&gt;<i> centers, linked to vast Fordist factories and eventual high-rise housing, as
</I>&gt;<i> the 'social condensers' of a new proletarian civilization, they were also
</I>&gt;<i> elaborating a practical strategy for leveraging poor urban workers' standard
</I>&gt;<i> of living in otherwise austere circumstances.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In the context of global environmental emergency, this Constructivist
</I>&gt;<i> project could be translated into the proposition that the egalitarian
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of city life consistently provide the best sociological and physical
</I>&gt;<i> supports for resource conservation and carbon mitigation. Indeed, there is
</I>&gt;<i> little hope of mitigating greenhouse emissions or adapting human habitats to
</I>&gt;<i> the Anthropocene unless the movement to control global warming converges
</I>&gt;<i> with the struggle to raise living standards and abolish world poverty. And
</I>&gt;<i> in real life, beyond the IPCC's simplistic scenarios, this means
</I>&gt;<i> participating in the struggle for democratic control over urban space,
</I>&gt;<i> capital flows, resource-sheds, and large-scale means of production.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I think the inner crisis in environmental politics today is precisely the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of bold concepts that address the challenges of poverty, energy,
</I>&gt;<i> biodiversity, and climate change within an integrated vision of human
</I>&gt;<i> progress. At a micro-level, of course, there have been enormous strides in
</I>&gt;<i> developing alternative technologies and passive energy housing, but
</I>&gt;<i> demonstration projects in wealthy communities and rich countries will not
</I>&gt;<i> save the world. The more affluent, to be sure, can now choose from an
</I>&gt;<i> abundance of designs for eco-living: but what is the ultimate goal: to allow
</I>&gt;<i> well-meaning celebrities to brag about their zero-carbon lifestyles or to
</I>&gt;<i> bring solar energy, toilets, pediatric clinics and mass transit to poor
</I>&gt;<i> urban communities?&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Tackling the challenge of sustainable urban design for the whole planet,
</I>&gt;<i> and not just for a few privileged countries or social groups, requires a
</I>&gt;<i> vast stage for the imagination, such as the arts and sciences inhabited in
</I>&gt;<i> the May days of Vhutemas and the Bauhaus. It presupposes a radical
</I>&gt;<i> willingness to think beyond the horizon of neo-liberal capitalism toward a
</I>&gt;<i> global revolution that reintegrates the labor of the informal working
</I>&gt;<i> classes, as well as the rural poor, in the sustainable reconstruction of
</I>&gt;<i> their built environments and livelihoods.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Of course, this is an utterly unrealistic scenario, but one either
</I>&gt;<i> embarks on a journey of hope, believing that collaborations between
</I>&gt;<i> architects, engineers, ecologists, and activists can play small, but
</I>&gt;<i> essential roles in making an alter-monde more possible, or one submits to a
</I>&gt;<i> future in which designers are just the hireling imagineers of elite,
</I>&gt;<i> alternative existences. The planetary 'green zones' may offer pharaonic
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities for the monumentalization of individual visions, but the moral
</I>&gt;<i> questions of architecture and planning can only be resolved in the tenements
</I>&gt;<i> and sprawl of the 'red zones.'*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *From this perspective, I believe that only a return to explicitly utopian
</I>&gt;<i> thinking can clarify the minimal conditions for the preservation of human
</I>&gt;<i> solidarity in face of convergent planetary crises. I think I understand what
</I>&gt;<i> the Italian Marxist architects Tafuri and Dal Co meant when they cautioned
</I>&gt;<i> against &quot;a regression to the utopian,&quot; but to raise our imaginations to the
</I>&gt;<i> challenge of the Anthropocene, we must be able to envision alternative
</I>&gt;<i> configurations of agents, practices and social relations, and this requires,
</I>&gt;<i> in turn, that we suspend the politico-economic assumptions that chain us to
</I>&gt;<i> the present.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I speak, of course, as an aging Socialist, who still believes in the
</I>&gt;<i> self-emancipation of labor with the same fervor with which Governor Palin
</I>&gt;<i> believes in shooting caribou. But utopianism isn't necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> millenarianism, nor is it confined just to the soapbox or pulpit. One of the
</I>&gt;<i> most encouraging developments in that emergent intellectual space where
</I>&gt;<i> researchers and activists discuss the impacts of global warming on
</I>&gt;<i> development has been a new willingness to advocate the Necessary rather than
</I>&gt;<i> the merely Practical. A growing chorus of expert voices warn that either we
</I>&gt;<i> fight for 'impossible' solutions to the increasingly entangled crises of
</I>&gt;<i> urban poverty and climate change, or become ourselves complicit in a de
</I>&gt;<i> facto triage of humanity.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Thus I think we can be cheered by a recent editorial (11 September 2008)
</I>&gt;<i> in Nature. Explaining that the &quot;challenges of rampant urbanization demands
</I>&gt;<i> integrated, multidisciplinary approaches, and new thinking,' the editors
</I>&gt;<i> challenge the rich countries to finance a zero-carbon revolution in the
</I>&gt;<i> cities of the developing world. &quot;It may seem utopian,&quot; they write, &quot;to
</I>&gt;<i> promote these innovations in emerging and developing-world megacities, many
</I>&gt;<i> of whose inhabitants can barely afford a roof over their heads. *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *But those countries have already shown a gift for technological
</I>&gt;<i> fast-forwarding, for example, by leapfrogging the need for landline
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure to embrace mobile phones. And many poorer countries have a
</I>&gt;<i> rich tradition of adapting buildings to local practices, environments, and
</I>&gt;<i> climates - a home-grown approach to integrated design that has been all but
</I>&gt;<i> lost in the West. They now have an opportunity to combine these traditional
</I>&gt;<i> approaches with modern technologies.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Similarly, the 2007/2008 United Nations Human Development Report warns
</I>&gt;<i> that the 'future of human solidarity' depends upon a massive aid program to
</I>&gt;<i> help developing countries adapt to climate shocks. The Report calls for
</I>&gt;<i> removing the &quot;obstacles to the rapid disbursement of the low-carbon
</I>&gt;<i> technologies needed to avoid dangerous climate change. &#8230; the world's poor
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be left to sink or swim with their own resources while rich countries
</I>&gt;<i> protect their citizens behind climate-defence fortifications.&quot; *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Put bluntly,&quot; it continues,&quot; the world's poor and future generations
</I>&gt;<i> cannot afford the complacency and prevarication that continues to
</I>&gt;<i> characterize international negotiations on climate change.&quot; The refusal to
</I>&gt;<i> act decisively on behalf of all humanity would be &quot;a moral failure on a
</I>&gt;<i> scale unparalleled in history.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *If this sounds like a sentimental call to the barricades, an echo from
</I>&gt;<i> classrooms and studios of forty years ago, then so be it. Because if you
</I>&gt;<i> accept any of the evidence presented in the first half of this talk, then
</I>&gt;<i> taking a 'realist' view of the human prospect, like seeing Medusa's head,
</I>&gt;<i> would simply turn you into stone.&quot;*
