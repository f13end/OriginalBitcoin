Chris,

Your argument that PageRank promotes sensationalism while wikipedia
process promotes quality is self defeating because for every search on
google on any given topic available in Wikipedia the first link in the
PageRank result point to Wikipedia.

In his case, you are frustrating yourself as you argue against your own logic.

big difference - between results and means.

Are you saying that Wikipedia games the Google Pagerank algorithm or
that Google treats wikipedia favorably due to political bias rather
than based on an impartial algorithm?

Both conclusions have negative implications on Wikipedia, but I doubt
that they are true.

What I know is true is that PageRank simply works and that is based on
the fact that Google is favored by more users than any other search
engine.

So for any wikipedia competitor that allows multiple versions per
topic the highest ranking version should have the same chance
eventually as the Wikipedia page for that topic assuming it simply
copies the Wikipedia entry, and if iy manages to have higher quality
content according to PageRank then it should rank higher than the
Wikipedia page for the same topic.

In otherwords, having it done in an impartial way by an algorithm is
better for freedom of knowledge.

Having a few admins dictate what knowledge is has the smell of dictatorship.

Neither.

Good quality, useful sites are often popular, so it gets a high
PageRank. Wikipedia benefits from this. Also that it's easy for blogs
to link to Wikipedia for explanations of things.

Popular sites are not automatically good quality or useful in the same sense.

But they don't, in the cases I'm aware of. There are rules, and some
people don't like those rules, especially those promoting their own
theories. That's behind much (not all) of the resentment towards
admins.

Your argument is clearly in favor of the established order.

doesn't matter much what it's in favor of - it matters whether the
argument is sound.

I don't think its sound today. Maybe a 100 years ago. That is my opinion.

This brings the list up to date on the Wikiversity/Wikipedia debate...
