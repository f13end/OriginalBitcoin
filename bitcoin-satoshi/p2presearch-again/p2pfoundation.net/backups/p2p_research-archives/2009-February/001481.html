<PRE>Hi Tere,

&lt;&lt;
&gt;<i> I also want to add re: Marc's point &quot;It's simple demand-supply math. If

</I>&gt;<i> production and *delaying* or *abandoning* new production because of the low
</I>&gt;<i> price.) This might very well result in more oil being left in the ground
</I>&gt;<i> despite the fact that it at the same time relatively &quot;runs out&quot;. All of this
</I>&gt;<i> is happening despite the fact that everybody knows that oil will run out in
</I>&gt;<i> the time of some decades.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Let me explain why I do not fully buy the above stated argument.

In the US, Oil is 2X more expensive now than it was 10 years ago. So
in 10 years it has doubled.

I am speaking of prices as of today (after the economic meltdown) and
they may continue to rise despite the economic meltdown.

However, while I don't have the data, I can infer that the price of
gallium has not doubled in the last 10 years and this is based on the
fact that IR laser diodes and other products using gallium have
continued to decrease in price. In other words, I know the price of
things that use gallium has continued to go down.

So while the wedge thesis is correct to some extent it does not
account for the increase in prices of oil. So it's an imperfect thesis
in this sense.

Price of oil is higher than it was 10 years ago (double the price)
while the price of gallium (as inferred from the price of goods that
use gallium and where gallium is the most costly part, e.g. IR laser
diodes) has gone down in the last 10 years.

So demand and supply math would still hold even if there was a wedge
as you describe (as in the case of oil)

But since price of gallium has not risen, I argue that there is no
shortage YET and that any papers written that claim such shortage
MAYBE an attempt by some suppliers to hype up scarcity to get in early
on the massive profits.

Note that the oil companies made over $40 Billion dollars in profit.

Fear is a big business.

Marc
