<PRE>Kevin,

I find this a great explanation of what your mutualist tradition is about,
so I will publish it on the blog on the 17th,

<A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/unequal-exchange-of-labor-at-the-heart-of-the-mutualist-argument/2009/02/17">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/unequal-exchange-of-labor-at-the-heart-of-the-mutualist-argument/2009/02/17</A>

excerpt will start from: Unequal exchange was built into the labor market
from the beginning.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; I agree with most of the LTV and by &quot;normative&quot; I meant that the LTV
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; provides an objective notion of &quot;fair price&quot; (if price exceeds the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; average cost of production it is a sign that some barrier prevents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; competitors from entering).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  That's true, but if that's your ideal, it's not much different from what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  things are now, since in most areas, the barriers of entry are
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  weak to make the actual prices quite similar to the &quot;fair price&quot;, as you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  call it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The problem with capitalism isn't that prices are &quot;unfair&quot;--most prices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  aren't. There are other problems. First, production only takes place if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  there is _profit._ The goal of all capitalist production is to make
</I>&gt;<i> profit,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  i.e. to turn money into more money. So, in order to get the things you
</I>&gt;<i> need,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  you have to convince some capitalist that they need you, i.e. that
</I>&gt;<i> employing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  you allows them to make more profit than they would make otherwise. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  capitalists only need a limited number of personnel, much less than
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  are people on Earth, so that's the big hurdle which most people fail to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  overcome (when speaking on a global scale).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  A second problem is that, as a worker, you don't sell the results of
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  labor, you sell your _labor power_ (workers, or would-be workers, are
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  who don't have anything to sell than their labor power--most people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  haven't). The deal by selling your labor power is: you get paid the
</I>&gt;<i> value of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  your labor power (NOT the value of your labor--labor doesn't _have_
</I>&gt;<i> value,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  it _produces_ values), and the value of your labor power is what you
</I>&gt;<i> need in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  order to survive (according to your local community standard of living).
</I>&gt;<i> In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  return, you have to give your full labor power (according to the local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  standard for the length of they work day/week, say, 8 hours a day/40
</I>&gt;<i> hours a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  week). If the production of the goods you need for your standard of
</I>&gt;<i> living
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  takes 20 hours a week, you still have to work 40 hours--the other 20
</I>&gt;<i> hours
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  are the &quot;surplus&quot;--they go to the capitalist, become their profit and
</I>&gt;<i> are,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  in fact, the only reason why they employed you in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  So the problem isn't unfair prices, it's the fact that people have to
</I>&gt;<i> sell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  their labor power, because they don't have anything else to sell. And
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  situation will necessarily arise in a market system (even in a
</I>&gt;<i> fictitious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  scenario where initially everybody had some means to
</I>&gt;<i> production--inevitable,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  some people would go bankrupt and again have only their labor power to
</I>&gt;<i> sell).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was at the heart of Marx's conflict with Proudhon and
</I>&gt;<i> market-oriented Ricardian socialists like Thomas Hogskin.  As Maurice
</I>&gt;<i> Dobb pointed out in his introduction to Contribution to the Critique
</I>&gt;<i> of Political Economy, &quot;unequal exchange&quot; was &quot;the kind of explanation
</I>&gt;<i> that Marx was avoiding rather than seeking&quot;:  &quot;It did not make
</I>&gt;<i> exploitation consistent with the law of value and with market
</I>&gt;<i> competition, but explained it by departures from, or imperfections in,
</I>&gt;<i> the latter.&quot;  And this explanation left him vulnerable to a response
</I>&gt;<i> from left-wing classical liberals, including market socialists like
</I>&gt;<i> Hodgskin and the American individualist anarchists:  &quot;join with us in
</I>&gt;<i> demanding really free trade and then there can be no 'unequal
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges' and exploitation.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This defensive posture was indicated, I think, by Engels' argument
</I>&gt;<i> against the &quot;force theory&quot; in Anti-Duhring that the development of the
</I>&gt;<i> wage system would have followed the same path even had there been no
</I>&gt;<i> land expropriations, slavery, authoritarian state controls on labor,
</I>&gt;<i> etc., involved in the primitive accumulation process.  In so doing, he
</I>&gt;<i> essentially backtracked (apparently with Marx's approval, given that
</I>&gt;<i> Marx is supposed to have examined the manuscripts) from Marx's
</I>&gt;<i> brilliant historical analysis in vol. 1 of Capital.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an individualist anarchist, obviously, I believe Hodgskin et al got
</I>&gt;<i> it right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unequal exchange was built into the labor market from the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> That unequal exchange results not from the sale of labor-power as
</I>&gt;<i> such, but from the fact that privilege (state-enforced scarcity of
</I>&gt;<i> land and capital) makes land and capital artificially costly and
</I>&gt;<i> forces labor to sell itself in a buyer's market, paying a premium for
</I>&gt;<i> access to the means of production.  The natural price of labor in a
</I>&gt;<i> free market is not, as Ricardo and Marx argued, its reproduction cost
</I>&gt;<i> (however that argument is qualified by the cultural definition of
</I>&gt;<i> reproduction cost).  The natural price of labor results from its
</I>&gt;<i> disutility:  the fact that only labor, of all the &quot;factors of
</I>&gt;<i> production,&quot; must be forced to contribute itself to the production
</I>&gt;<i> process. This is why effort is the source of all exchange value.  As
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Tucker argued, in a free market only what has cost
</I>&gt;<i> contributes to cost; and in the end, what but labor has any real cost?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The prices of all the non-labor factors, over and above amortization
</I>&gt;<i> costs of embedded past labor, result from monopoly rents attending to
</I>&gt;<i> artificial property rights.  They are examples of Dobb's privileged
</I>&gt;<i> tollgate keepers, engaged in what Veblen called &quot;capitalized
</I>&gt;<i> serviceability.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Were such forms of artificial scarcity not enforced by the state, and
</I>&gt;<i> were labor allowed free access to vacant land and allowed to mobilize
</I>&gt;<i> credit at cost without the state banking system's entry barriers, then
</I>&gt;<i> a much larger portion of the labor force would be self-employed,
</I>&gt;<i> either in individual and family businesses or in worker co-ops.  More
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, where wage employment continued, the rate of profit would
</I>&gt;<i> be driven down by competition from the possibility of self-employment.
</I>&gt;<i>  As a wide range of thinkers have pointed out, it is only possible to
</I>&gt;<i> get labor to work for less than its full product only when it is
</I>&gt;<i> deprived of independent access to the means of subsistence and
</I>&gt;<i> production.  That's why it has been such a central focus of the
</I>&gt;<i> employed classes to close off such access, and to eliminate
</I>&gt;<i> competition from the possibility of self-employment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even so, under the old and conventionally (but wrongly) named
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;laissez-faire&quot; regime, you are at least right that commodities tended
</I>&gt;<i> toward their actual value.  The main form of exploitation took place
</I>&gt;<i> within the production process, through the sale of labor-power at less
</I>&gt;<i> than its natural rate (which was its full product).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this is not at all true of commodity prices under monopoly
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism.  Economic exploitation in the exchange process has,
</I>&gt;<i> arguably, superceded exploitation in the employment process in
</I>&gt;<i> importance.  It's quite likely that the total of super-profits
</I>&gt;<i> extracted from the consumer through oligopoly markup, embedded rents
</I>&gt;<i> on artificial property rights like &quot;intellectual property,&quot; etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> exceed the amount of surplus value extracted through the production
</I>&gt;<i> process.
