This explanation makes complete sense to me.

But the question I asked is more of a political one than an analytical one.

It is possible to simplify the problem in order to gain traction. That's
what I was thinking. You can rally people against &quot;gambling&quot; (don't even
elevate it philosophically to &quot;speculation&quot;) but you cannot rally people
against the fractional reserve system because it is an abstraction that
obstructs the archetypes (or basic patterns) people familiar with: slavery,
or owing to a master ( as in paying &quot;interest&quot;) and carelessness born of
greed (as in gambling.)

I think there is a better chance of popular support for a movement that
simply calls for abolishing interest and gambling on moral basis than
analytical basis.

Marc



*&quot; Why don't we see a grassroots movement to abolish financial gambling
&gt;<i> markets? &quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to very much an extent, you will find such kind of alter-globalization&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter-globalization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter-globalization</A>&gt;grassroot ( or
</I>&gt;<i> netroots &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netroots">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netroots</A>&gt; ? or rhizomatic ? )
</I>&gt;<i> movements converging through ecologies/brands such as ATTAC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATTAC">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATTAC</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which initially was created to demand taxation of speculation on stock
</I>&gt;<i> markets ( &quot;tobin tax&quot; ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then, it may not simply be the stock market, but also the current
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream monetary creation architecture - the way money is created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> further notes :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I currently understand it:
</I>&gt;<i> fiat currency created through fractional reserve&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking</A>&gt;banking ; debt with interest needing ever more economic growth ( and new
</I>&gt;<i> markets, including speculative markets ) to create more debt with interest
</I>&gt;<i> to cover the interest owed to the banks,
</I>&gt;<i> monopolized by a few currencies by a globalized banking system cartel;
</I>&gt;<i> This, from my current point of view, creating the foundations, and even the
</I>&gt;<i> need for such pyramidal gambling structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might also be interesting to understand what we would want to define as
</I>&gt;<i> speculation &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> Simply by accepting fiat currency&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency</A>&gt;for a service or a product I offer, I might, through trusting the potential
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee on such units ( as for example the guarantee to pay taxes with it
</I>&gt;<i> ? ) , be speculating that these units can be used for other exchange
</I>&gt;<i> purposes in a near or distant future ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence it might be interesting to have monetary creation systems with full
</I>&gt;<i> transparency to all as to what or who guarantees, and what we deem being of
</I>&gt;<i> value for a guarantee.  It also opens up the question of property, and
</I>&gt;<i> accumulation of property, hence also the question of the commons. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, Can individuals or entities accumulating property beyond their own
</I>&gt;<i> use value needs responsibly guarantee / speculate (?)  their property in the
</I>&gt;<i> interest of social and ecological well being and sustainability for all ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel such questions lead us back to ecologies such as p2pfoundation or
</I>&gt;<i> the transitioner , which serve as aggregators for individuals with questions
</I>&gt;<i> and potential alternatives for ( holoptic? - as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</A> ) distributed systems, towards
</I>&gt;<i> increased ( emergent ? ) collective intelligence ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ps: I mentionned ATTAC, just to name one of the possibly current best known
</I>&gt;<i> alter-globalization convergence &quot;brands&quot; focusing on questions of finance in
</I>&gt;<i> western europe and beyond / apparently active in about 40 countries in the
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there are others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly one may also want to mention other thinkthanks / thinknets
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/">http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/">http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also ... some of us here connected through p2pf ecologies ? ( around
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/">http://p2pfoundation.net</A> , <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net</A> ,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/">http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and ( perhaps ? ) one may also mention some of our friends working on
</I>&gt;<i> complementary currencies / alternative monetary creation systems - might be
</I>&gt;<i> worth double checking what kind of speculative aspects might be included in
</I>&gt;<i> various financial architectures proposed by each - :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/">http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/</A> , open coin, bit coin, lietaer with

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Someone had come up with a probabilistic formula to estimate the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> probability of risk associated with a given random pool of derivative
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> securities. It worked 99% of the time in predicting the probability of risk
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> by making the flawed assumption that a high degree of correlation between
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> independent random variables (across different types of derivatives) was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actually expressing some hidden causality (some magic in the way nature
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> worked that no one had yet understood) when in fact all it was expressing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was a very high degree of correlation between completely independent random
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variables.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When statisticians play physicist they use the term &quot;copula&quot; which is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bundling of independent random variables with high correlation into a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> constant. This &quot;copula&quot; method assumes that there is some hidden causality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that no one really understands but that can be used to calculate with high
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certainty the probability of risk associated with a random pool of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> derivative securities each with it's own set of independent random
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variables, without analyzing each derivative security individually, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without having to put only derivatives of the same type in the same pool. As
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if statistics had found some hidden causality in nature, which happens all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the time, e.g. Gaussian distribution is common in nature but not universal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> yet it is assumed to be universal by some statisticians as if it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> physical law. In other words, high degree of correlation is often confused
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with causation or is taken to be hidden causation in order to simplify some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> probabilistic calculation (at the expense of misleading the user.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So bankers were able to bundle all sorts of derivatives into the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pools and rate them together using the said magic formula, which allowed a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> massive increase in the volume of trading in securities (went from double
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> digit billions to double digit trillions in just over 10 years.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When the market conditions changed this copula (or assumed hidden
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> causality) went out of the window and the magic formula's ability to predict
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the probability of risk associated with pools of derivatives went out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> window with it. So what we ended up with were credit securities pools that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were rated AAA but had dog shit in them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ~~
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That satisfies my personal curiosity as to what happened.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It could have been avoided if the person responsible for the now-infamous
