<PRE>*&quot; Why don't we see a grassroots movement to abolish financial gambling
markets? &quot;*

to very much an extent, you will find such kind of
alter-globalization&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter-globalization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter-globalization</A>&gt;grassroot
( or
netroots &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netroots">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netroots</A>&gt; ? or rhizomatic ? )
movements converging through ecologies/brands such as ATTAC

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATTAC">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATTAC</A>

which initially was created to demand taxation of speculation on stock
markets ( &quot;tobin tax&quot; ).

But then, it may not simply be the stock market, but also the current
mainstream monetary creation architecture - the way money is created.

further notes :

As I currently understand it:
fiat currency created through fractional
reserve&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking</A>&gt;banking
; debt with interest needing ever more economic growth ( and new
markets, including speculative markets ) to create more debt with interest
to cover the interest owed to the banks,
monopolized by a few currencies by a globalized banking system cartel;
This, from my current point of view, creating the foundations, and even the
need for such pyramidal gambling structure.

It might also be interesting to understand what we would want to define as
speculation &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation</A>&gt;.
Simply by accepting fiat
currency&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency</A>&gt;for a service or a
product I offer, I might, through trusting the potential
guarantee on such units ( as for example the guarantee to pay taxes with it
? ) , be speculating that these units can be used for other exchange
purposes in a near or distant future ?

Hence it might be interesting to have monetary creation systems with full
transparency to all as to what or who guarantees, and what we deem being of
value for a guarantee.  It also opens up the question of property, and
accumulation of property, hence also the question of the commons. For
example, Can individuals or entities accumulating property beyond their own
use value needs responsibly guarantee / speculate (?)  their property in the
interest of social and ecological well being and sustainability for all ?

I feel such questions lead us back to ecologies such as p2pfoundation or the
transitioner , which serve as aggregators for individuals with questions and
potential alternatives for ( holoptic? - as opposed to
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</A> ) distributed systems, towards
increased ( emergent ? ) collective intelligence ?

ps: I mentionned ATTAC, just to name one of the possibly current best known
alter-globalization convergence &quot;brands&quot; focusing on questions of finance in
western europe and beyond / apparently active in about 40 countries in the
world.

But there are others.

Possibly one may also want to mention other thinkthanks / thinknets

<A HREF="http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/">http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/</A>

<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/">http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/</A>

Also ... some of us here connected through p2pf ecologies ? ( around
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/">http://p2pfoundation.net</A> , <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net</A> ,
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/">http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/</A> )

and ( perhaps ? ) one may also mention some of our friends working on
complementary currencies / alternative monetary creation systems - might be
worth double checking what kind of speculative aspects might be included in
various financial architectures proposed by each - :

<A HREF="http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/">http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/</A> , open coin, bit coin, lietaer with
terra's&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Currency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Currency</A>&gt;, ... you, me ?
... :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is based on something I read recently but cannot locate atm....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone had come up with a probabilistic formula to estimate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probability of risk associated with a given random pool of derivative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> securities. It worked 99% of the time in predicting the probability of risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by making the flawed assumption that a high degree of correlation between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent random variables (across different types of derivatives) was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually expressing some hidden causality (some magic in the way nature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worked that no one had yet understood) when in fact all it was expressing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was a very high degree of correlation between completely independent random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variables.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When statisticians play physicist they use the term &quot;copula&quot; which is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bundling of independent random variables with high correlation into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant. This &quot;copula&quot; method assumes that there is some hidden causality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that no one really understands but that can be used to calculate with high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainty the probability of risk associated with a random pool of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> derivative securities each with it's own set of independent random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variables, without analyzing each derivative security individually, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without having to put only derivatives of the same type in the same pool. As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if statistics had found some hidden causality in nature, which happens all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time, e.g. Gaussian distribution is common in nature but not universal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet it is assumed to be universal by some statisticians as if it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical law. In other words, high degree of correlation is often confused
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with causation or is taken to be hidden causation in order to simplify some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probabilistic calculation (at the expense of misleading the user.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So bankers were able to bundle all sorts of derivatives into the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pools and rate them together using the said magic formula, which allowed a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> massive increase in the volume of trading in securities (went from double
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> digit billions to double digit trillions in just over 10 years.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the market conditions changed this copula (or assumed hidden
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> causality) went out of the window and the magic formula's ability to predict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the probability of risk associated with pools of derivatives went out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window with it. So what we ended up with were credit securities pools that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were rated AAA but had dog shit in them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ~~
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That satisfies my personal curiosity as to what happened.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It could have been avoided if the person responsible for the now-infamous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> derivatives valuation formula did not treat causality (or lack of) in such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shallow and stupid way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some kids have an imaginary friend. Some statisticians have an imaginary
