 Israel as Idolatry&lt;<A HREF="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=wh4wuqABkGtbafjZwQ2gxfeyFuLDnSr%2B">http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=wh4wuqABkGtbafjZwQ2gxfeyFuLDnSr%2B</A>&gt;
Sep 21, 2009 05:25 pm | Rabbi Michael Lerner

Blind loyalty to Israel is the primary form of idolatry today in the Jewish
world. Go into any synagogue in the US or Israel and you can tell people
that you don't believe in God, don't observe the commands of Torah, don't
observe the Sabbath, or even that you plan to be eating a pig sandwich ...

Amazing article in my local newspaper about a national phenomenon I had
totally missed: a nonprofit out of Massachusetts called NACA (Neighborhood
Assistance Corporation of America) has been organizing massive mortgage
restructuring events across the country. NACA's Save the Dream tour has
become a nationwide phenomenon, drawing more than 180,000 desperate people
this summer to gigs ...

President Obama told Congress he would not sign a health care bill that
added any amount to the national debt - a criterion he does not use when
considering escalating war in Afghanistan or bailouts to banks. In a recent
article for Tikkun, Dr. Arnold Relman argues that there is no way to meet
that criterion ...

I had the opportunity to interview New Mexico Congressman Ben Ray Lujan in
his Washington office on Thursday September 17. Limited internet access
while traveling, unfamiliarity with mp3 files, Rosh Hashanah and the
complete failure of our household plumbing conspired to prevent me from
posting the interview and transcript until today. I apologize in advance ...

Today an email arrived that bowled me over. It's from Shailja Patel. I love
the synchronicity of its arrival. Balmurli Natrajan has been blogging about
Hindu fascism from a secular perspective. Shailja Patel enlarges that point
of view by adding a Goddess perspective. It's especially appropriate to post
this letter today, for as Shailja states, ...

I have been lucky this summer to be a partial witness to an upheaval at a

Marcus Buckingham has caused a stir in the blogosphere by reporting on the
United States General Social Survey about American women's happiness. The
long and short of it is that women are unhappier than they were 40 years ago
(and men are happier). Nobody can figure this out. People have their own pet
theories (See ...

Louise Cankar, an assistant professor of sociology at Marquette University,
recently published a book in which she argues that, while anti-Muslim
suspicion existed prior to 9/11, 9/11 created an environment in which
hostility toward Muslims could thrive and their political and social
exclusion could be legitimated by both the government and nativist
Americans. ...
