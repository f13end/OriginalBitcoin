<PRE>Matt,

I was the one that wrote what you quoted, below.

A parallel to consider is the use of nonviolence struggle methods to oppose
regimes.  When one person gets away with a daring display of defiance, and
the next time a dozen people, and the next time a hundred people, well...
hey, maybe it's doable.  But how many people have the &quot;right stuff&quot; for that
first daring display?  Usually, few.  Further, the initial action may well
be an innovation in some way, or performed by someone with &quot;nothing left to
lose.&quot;  Tragically, when opposing regimes, that could be a person like a
mother whose son was &quot;disappeared&quot; by the government.  It could also be
teenagers with &quot;more courage than sense&quot; poking fun at the government.  Once
a movement has started, people join up because the barrier to entry has
lowered, whether because they figure they're less likely to get arrested, or
they know that the GPL provides a solid legal wrapper for their software.

Moral imperative may drive initial adoption, but it will only gain masses of
followers if it's effective in producing good results for the peer or larger
social group.  This may be up-and-coming politicians that want a position in
the new government in an overthrow, or someone that doesn't want to write a
packet sniffer from scratch.  These results may vary from person to person,
and of course there's nothing stopping someone from benefiting in very
substantive ways and simultaneously feeling they're on moral high ground.

However, we cannot assume that the motivations surrounding the birth of the
movement continue to be--for the majority--the primary motivators during
subsequent adoption.  I would argue that we should reject any such
assumption.

The courageous/zealous/eccentric/brilliant/naive pioneers demonstrate the
method can work.  The ideal that &quot;something better is possible&quot; drives the
pioneers, and the rest follow from a combination of social proof and proof
found in the tasting of the pudding.  To mix metaphors further, while some
truly believe in the values surrounding the initial use of the method, for
the rest that moral high ground is just gravy.  They may self-report the
moral ground as being important, and they likely believe it.  The real test
of mettle is measuring their actual behavior (but of course, it's far easier
to survey people than monitor them).  Please note, I'm not saying they're
being consciously dishonest or deceptive.

Someone might think that &quot;selling&quot; a movement would fare better if benefits
rather than ideals were &quot;sold&quot; to the masses.  I don't think so: it looks
better to others--and even ourselves--to be &quot;sold&quot; on moral high ground
while we quietly detect more substantive benefits.  This is all likely to be
mostly subconscious, but can be an important consideration in working toward
adoption of something.

In the case of a publically-traded companies, one would want to make the
substantive benefits more salient, because it's ok to value them above moral
concerns in that situation.  Nothing personal, it's just business.  However,
the movement may very well may be sending the wrong signal to the company as
well: that they're willing to compromise in order to secure adoption.  I
think this is a grave mistake, too often made, and I think the history of
attempts to compromise free software licenses pushes this point home.
