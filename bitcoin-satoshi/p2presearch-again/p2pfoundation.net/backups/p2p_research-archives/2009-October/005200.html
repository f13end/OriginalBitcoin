Forum)

The first International Free Culture Forum will take place in Barcelona from
October 29 to November 1 2009. This event will bring together the main
organizations and most active voices in the world of Free Culture and Free
Knowledge to set common agendas and strategies.

The Free Knowledge Institute co-organises the Free Culture Forum and invites
you to be part of this unique and historical moment.

&quot;The battle for access to information and the Internet is the mother of all
battles, the one that will allow us to keep going autonomously and
creatively in crisis times, regardless of what the powers that be &quot;organise&quot;
for their own interest...&quot;
/Zaphod Beeblebrox, Digital Thoughts/

Because in times of crisis, the European Parliament is discussing how to
take away one of the few remaining ways that allow citizens to get ahead &#8211;
open access to the Internet &#8211; and to hand it over to the multinationals
(this is not science fiction; it is happening now - follow the links below
[1]);

Because we must be able to benefit from spreading our works without
middlemen;

Because we are fed up with plundering by royalties management organisations;

Because artists are being used as an excuse to restrict legal rights to
expression and development;

Because copying and sharing information is our right to culture, to
knowledge and to communication, and they want to give it away to the
entertainment industry  (this isn&#8217;t science fiction either &#8211; the American
Chamber of Commerce is pressuring worldwide for changes to the Intellectual
Property Laws to prevent the right to copy and share information [2]);

Because their business is not our culture;

Because it is important for artists to be able to make a living from their
work if they wish to;

Because &#8220;greed breaks the sack&#8221; as we saw in this crisis that has shown us
that we live in a system that expects us to protect the interests of banks
and multinationals, in the hope that they might one day give us a job in
exchange for the crumbs of their profits.
The philosophy of free culture, inherited from the free software movement,
is the best empirical proof that a new kind of ethics and a new kind of
business are possible. It has already created an alternative production
space that works, based on an artisan or trade model in which the
author-producer doesn't lose control of his or her output and doesn't need
the mediation of big monopolies. A kind of production that is committed to
autonomous initiatives in solidarity with others, to sharing based on each
person's abilities and opportunities, to the democratisation of knowledge,
education and the means of production and to fair distribution of earnings
based on work carried out. *

And because actions speak louder than words, thousands of individuals and
organisations, hundreds of artists, have joined forces...

we welcome back to Barcelona, Spain...

*

*The oXcars*
*29 October 2009*
*the biggest free culture event of all time*
<A HREF="http://oxcars09.exgae.net/">http://oxcars09.exgae.net</A>

And, for the first time, we introduce

*The International Free Culture Forum*
*Organisation and Action*
*30 October to 1 Novembre 2009*
where we will put down in black and white the politics of the digital age as
demanded by citizens, by you and by me (this is not science fiction!)
<A HREF="http://fcforum.net/">http://fcforum.net/</A>

This is an invitation extended to everybody, and an invitation extended to
over 1000 institutions that legislate on our rights worldwide, an invitation
to listen and to understand, because the way of life and development of
citizens is at stake.
On October 25th we will reveal how each and every one of them has responded.

The oXcars and The Free Culture Forum are open to everybody. Come along,
find out about absolutely everything and participate.
This is unstoppable, we can only win. The civil society has its word to say
on access to knowledge and culture in the digital age.

Please, spread the info.

&quot;It was the same with the inquisition: digital progress is also unstoppable,
the only issue is how many years of suffering, stagnation and obscurantism
we will have to but up with before they admit that their interests are not
the centre of the universe&quot;.

The Free Culture Forum is organised by eXgae, Network Politics and the Free
Knowledge Institute in collaboration with many organisations that work for
the protection of digital freedom, privacy, open innovation and access to
knowledge. For regular communication in the context of the Forum we will be
using the autonomous microblogging platform identi.ca:

*Related material of interest*

[1] During the Free Culture Forum you will be able to collaborate, in flesh
and blood, with the organisations that are lobbying the European Parliament
exactly during these days in which the fearsome EU Telecoms Package is being
debated.
You can see what it's all about here:
<A HREF="http://www.laquadrature.net/en/we-must-protect-net-neutrality-in-europe-open-letter-to-the-european-parliament">http://www.laquadrature.net/en/we-must-protect-net-neutrality-in-europe-open-letter-to-the-european-parliament</A>
<A HREF="http://www.euopeninternet.eu/">http://www.euopeninternet.eu</A>

Here is information about who is on the committee, how they have voted (from
red to green, from more favourable to citizens to more favourable to
multinationals), and who we have to lobby in each country (if you know some
of them, talk to them; if you don&#8217;t know them, ring them up. These links
show you how):
<A HREF="http://werebuild.eu/wiki/index.php/Operation_revelation">http://werebuild.eu/wiki/index.php/Operation_revelation</A>
<A HREF="http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Telecoms_Package-Conciliation_Committe-Parliament_Delegation#Political_Memory:_MEPs_ranking_by_score">http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Telecoms_Package-Conciliation_Committe-Parliament_Delegation#Political_Memory:_MEPs_ranking_by_score</A>

What do we tell them?: to defend the original article 138, not the &quot;soft&quot;
version. That is: no private entity can monitor your digital
communication&quot;prior ruling by the judicial authorities&quot;.

Send to the Europarliamentarians the following sentence (this action is
carried out all over Europe):
&quot;&quot;*Prior ruling by the judicial authorities*&quot; is a condition of democracy.
Don't restrict basic freedoms. Using internet access is now instrumental to
basic freedoms. Defend the real Amendment 138&quot;. (Don't insult them if not
they will spam you. Here their telephone and emails:
