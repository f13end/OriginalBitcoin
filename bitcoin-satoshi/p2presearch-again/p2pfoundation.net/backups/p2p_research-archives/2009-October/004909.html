<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Here is one concern about a book award contest -- or, alternatively, 
consider this as a book nomination for the contest: :-)
   &quot;No Contest: The Case Against Competition&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/No-Contest-Case-Against-Competition/dp/0395631254">http://www.amazon.com/No-Contest-Case-Against-Competition/dp/0395631254</A>
&quot;Contending that competition in all areas -- school, family, sports and 
business -- is destructive, and that success so achieved is at the expense 
of another's failure, Kohn, a correspondent for USA Today, advocates a 
restructuring of our institutions to replace competition with cooperation. 
He persuasively demonstrates how the ingrained American myth that 
competition is the only normal and desirable way of life -- from Little 
Leagues to the presidency -- is counterproductive, personally and for the 
national economy, and how psychologically it poisons relationships, fosters 
anxiety and takes the fun out of work and play. He charges that competition 
is a learned phenomenon and denies that it builds character and self-esteem. 
Kohn's measures to encourage cooperation in lieu of competition include 
promoting noncompetitive games, eliminating scholastic grades and 
substitution of mutual security for national security.&quot;

So, if there must be a contest, how about a &quot;contest&quot; where people can 
nominate any book that is vaguely p2p (maybe have a filtering process of 
yes/no that it includes p2p themes) and then pick a winner randomly from the 
list of entries? :-)

Anyway, what exactly is the point of this award and this contest? Is it to 
promote p2p cooperation on making books? :-) Or to promote individual 
authors? Or to promote people writing new books? What are we trying to 
accomplish here?

People also have various abilities that are strengths and weaknesses in 
different situations, so even encouraging an author after-the-fact may not 
be a success, as I wrote here: :-)
   &quot;Post-Scarcity Princeton, or, Reading between the lines of PAW for 
prospective Princeton students, or, the Health Risks of Heart Disease &quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Plus, the very skills I use to write this essay are the very height of the 
old &quot;Princeton&quot; in some ways: alienation (elitism?), destructiveness 
(competitiveness?), dissatisfaction (excellence?), and so on. These are not 
the things Princeton most needs most going forward, but rather 
inclusiveness, cooperation, and effectiveness. Often our greatest strengths 
are also our greatest weaknesses, depending on the context. For another 
example, the same habits of mind that help me be a great programmer in some 
contexts -- perfectionism (great code), paranoia (useful for debugging), 
isolation (great for concentrating) and so on -- are also often huge 
weaknesses in dealing with people, where acceptance, trust, and 
gregariousness are usually key. So, being able to write this essay may prove 
my incompetence to do anything with the ideas in it. :-)
&quot;&quot;&quot;

(I'm not nominating that book unless the prize is selected randomly. :-)

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Prizes have been proposed as a much better solution than grants, and it&#8217;s 
not hard to see why: With a prize, the donor does not have to try to predict 
in advance who can achieve the proposed goal, nor how it will be achieved. 
Likewise, applicants don&#8217;t have to prove anything to the donor about their 
past performance&#8212;they just have to step up to the task at hand and do it. 
That means there&#8217;s no &#8220;artificial&#8221; barrier to entry. The success of the 
Ansari X-Prize, recently won by Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites with Space 
Ship One is a good example of how well prizes can work.[10, 11]
   Except for one problem, of course: money. Winning prizes is usually only 
an option for people already rich enough to fund their own research. Prizes 
do not provide money when it is most needed&#8212;during the development process, 
so they do little for people with ideas but no money. True, you can look for 
investors, but you still have to convince them in advance that you can do 
the job. It&#8217;s no coincidence that so many entrepreneurs started out in 
marketing!
   It&#8217;s also instructive to note some less-appealing details of the X-prize 
competition: once Space Ship One emerged as the clear leader, some 
competitors began to slack off, because there was no second place to strive 
for. Prizes fundamentally encourage competition and discourage cooperation, 
and they have all the benefits and dangers of competition as a result. In a 
field where effective cooperation seems to be essential to produce real 
quality, they can be seriously detrimental, as can be seen by the problems 
encountered by both Source Exchange and Co-Source -- the two &#8220;reverse 
auction&#8221; funding sites Raymond mentions in &#8220;The Magic Cauldron&#8221;, which are 
now long dead.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Two related Google searches:

Example result, and it is another book to nominate:
   &quot;Guide to Cooperative Games for Social Change&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm">http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Everyday  in communities around the world, youth activists, youth workers 
and educators are looking for powerful, purposeful activities that can 
change the world. At the same time, young people want to connect with adults 
in powerful relationships where they can actually change the world. The 
Guide to Cooperative Games for Social Change  provides a resource for people 
who want more from youth activities.
   The Guide features a powerful introduction to cooperative games, 
carefully detailing their relevance for activists and educators. It 
continues to provide clear, concise summaries of more than two dozen 
activities, including icebreakers, &quot;funners,&quot; and closers. Each description 
details exactly how the activity can be facilitated, as well as the 
equipment, time, and space needed.
   Since 2003 this document has been downloaded more than 10,000 times from 
The Freechild Project website. This revision features a clean, crisp layout 
and a fast download. Also, for the first time Freechild's parent 
organization offers print versions of this booklet for practitioners.
    <A HREF="http://www.commonaction.org/gamesguide.pdf">http://www.commonaction.org/gamesguide.pdf</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

An example from that book:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Human Scissors, Paper, Rock
Props: None
Purpose: Fun, energy-building
  Procedure: This is the human-size version of scissors/paper/rock. The end 
zones need  to be clearly defined. To begin, each team huddles and decides 
on which play to run- either rock, paper or scissors. Then the two teams 
meet in the playing area. If your team&#8217;s symbol wins, you chase the other 
team back into its end zone, trying to tag the team members before they get 
there. If your team&#8217;s symbol loses, you must dash back to your own end zone 
before you&#8217;re caught. Those people who get caught change to the other team. 
The game ends when everyone is on the same team.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

So, Tomas' idea is already a big success as we cooperate in building on it. 
:<i>-) I had never seen that book before. Or that game. I'm learning something 
</I>already. :-)

Here is a small company in Canada that makes and sells cooperative board 
games, BTW, which I will nominate as they have a book:
   <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/">http://www.familypastimes.com/</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/together.html">http://www.familypastimes.com/together.html</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Play as friends, not as enemies! Our games foster the spirit of 
co-operation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, 
bring in the harvest, complete a space exploration... They are never against 
each other.
   After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we 
bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then 
that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, 
destroy their armies &#8212; in other words, to get rid of one another! We soon 
learn how to pick on the other person's weaknesses in order to win the game.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Their book:
   &quot;Co-op Games Manual&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/Books/gamesmanual.html">http://www.familypastimes.com/Books/gamesmanual.html</A>
&quot;This softcover book includes over 170 co-op games and activities for ages 3 
to 12+. Little or no equipment is required. For small and large groups, from 
pre-schoolers through primary ages and also junior high level. Play these 
games in open spaces such as a farm, park or street, or the indoor spaces of 
a home living room, a school classroom, gym, etc. Try a co-op birthday 
party, co-op recess time, even a co-op play day.&quot;

A book co-written by someone with a &quot;Humor Project&quot; based near me:
   &quot;Playfair: A sampling of cooperative games&quot; by Matt Weinstein &amp; Joel Goodman
   <A HREF="http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC13/Playfair.htm">http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC13/Playfair.htm</A>
&quot;THE POSSIBILITIES FOR COOPERATIVE PLAY ARE VAST. In our book, we describe 
over sixty different games and activities we use in our PLAYFAIRS, and those 
sixty are just a small corner of a very large field. We don't have space for 
anything like that here, but we would like to share six of these games to 
give you a flavor for what is possible.&quot;

Although it is true that some of the books above are not available for free 
online. :-( So, maybe three categories of nominations (maybe with 
sub-categories like Tomas said of fiction/non-fiction)? Free to change, free 
to copy, and proprietary, with a random pick from each list? :-)
