<PRE>Another example of a &quot;clueless&quot; puzzle about skin color and health, from 2007:
   &quot;Schizophrenia in black Caribbeans living in the UK: an exploration of 
underlying causes of the high incidence rate&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2418996">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2418996</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
The incidence of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans living in the UK is 
substantially higher than in the white British population. When first 
reported, these findings were assumed to be a first-generation migrant 
effect or merely the result of methodological artefacts associated with 
inconsistencies in the diagnosis of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans and 
doubts about population denominators. More recently, it has become clear 
that the incidence of schizophrenia, based on standardised diagnosis and 
sophisticated census methods, is higher still in second-generation black 
Caribbeans. The largest study to date has demonstrated a ninefold higher 
risk of schizophrenia in UK-resident black Caribbeans: findings that are of 
concern to black Caribbean communities, to their GPs, and to health service 
managers responsible for resource allocation. A literature search was 
carried in order to explore possible reasons for the reported excess 
incidence of schizophrenia in UK-resident black Caribbeans. Competing 
hypotheses are reviewed and the paper concludes with a summary of specific 
social and psychological risk factors of significance within the black 
Caribbean community. Awareness of the factors associated with the onset and 
presentation of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans may help early diagnosis 
and rapid access to appropriate treatment which, in turn, appear to be 
related to improved long-term outcomes. ....
   CONCLUSION
   The high level of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans living in the UK 
probably reflects the interaction of multiple risk factors, many of which 
cluster in the black Caribbean community in the UK. Particularly significant 
factors appear to be the combination of isolation and exclusion, both within 
society (living in areas of low ethnic density and reduced participation in 
society) and within the family (family break-up and paternal separation). 
These factors seem to be more powerful than socioeconomic disadvantage, 
which is more likely to be a consequence than causal. Racism itself may 
contribute to social exclusion, increasing the vulnerability to 
schizophrenia. Biological or genetic susceptibility do not appear to explain 
high rates of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans. More research is needed 
about the role of cannabis, particularly in its more potent forms, and 
whether this contributes to the excess of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans.
   Understanding of high rates of schizophrenia in some ethnic groups may be 
enhanced by an exploration of protective factors. South Asians have 
experienced migration, problems with cultural assimilation, and 
sociodemographic disadvantage, and yet they experience only marginally 
higher rates of schizophrenia than those of the white British population. 
Further study is needed on whether social cohesion and strong family support 
or other factors within the South Asian community confer a protective effect.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

No mention there of Vitamin D.

To repeat: &quot;The largest study to date has demonstrated a ninefold higher 
risk of schizophrenia in UK-resident black Caribbeans: findings that are of 
concern to black Caribbean communities, to their GPs, and to health service 
managers responsible for resource allocation.&quot;

Such needless suffering. I'm not saying Vitamin D is the only issue -- but 
what if it is even just 10% of the issue?

There are more than half a million British African-Caribbean in the UK:
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_African-Caribbean_community">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_African-Caribbean_community</A>

Consider:
   <A HREF="http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm">http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder for most people who are afflicted, 
and very costly for families and society. The overall U.S. 2002 cost of 
schizophrenia was estimated to be $62.7 billion, with $22.7 billion excess 
direct health care cost ($7.0 billion outpatient, $5.0 billion drugs, $2.8 
billion inpatient, $8.0 billion long-term care). (source: Analysis Group, 
Inc.) ... Rates of schizophrenia are generally similar from country to 
country&#8212;about .5% to 1 percent of the population (there are variations - but 
the variance is difficult to track due to differing measuring standards in 
many countries, etc.).
&quot;&quot;&quot;

So, in the USA, with a three hundred million population, at 1% incidence, 
that's about three million cases, or about US$20,000 per year per person 
cost for management.

Let's assume (I don't know the exact figure for the UK) the lower bound 
there of 0.5% rate for UK for schizophrenia. That would mean 4.5% rate for 
schizophrenia for Afro-Carribeans in the UK. If all the excess was all due 
to Vitamin D deficiency (maybe not), that is an extra 4% of the population 
above a baseline 0.5%, or about 30,000 individuals in the UK Afro-Carribean 
community suffering from this issue, along with their families and 
communities. Given the high cost to deal with schizophrenia on families and 
communities, that helps explain some poverty. By the US costs, that would be 
about US$600 million in costs per year, for something than could perhaps be 
mostly prevented by US$20 in Vitamin D pills times about half a million 
people, or US$10 million a year. Not to mention the enormous personal 
suffering and family suffering.

But, the article just says we need more other drugs etc. to deal with this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Race is always a hot topic here but people always seem to neglect

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always a matter of stating that Blacks or other minorities are not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting enough treatment and early detection particularly in the realm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of cancer. It is true though, that Blacks do have higher rates of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every other disease you can think of. And money does not fix this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> health epidemic amongst Blacks as we have seen rich Black celebrities 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes die from degenerative and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preventable diseases. However Blacks and Whites do have different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> health concerns and challenges. It is not because Blacks are inferior 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or have bad genes. Blacks have different diets and a large percentage 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Blacks are on the low end of the economic bracket and do not have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access to healthy foods (That is not to excuse bad dietary habits by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blacks). Historically, Blacks have also been unable to receive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treatments from the medical establishment and have even been subject 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to crimes like the Tuskegee Experiment. So as a health researcher 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while researching general topics on health and wellness, I definitely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sought to know why Blacks have a myriad of health problems. One of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main reasons for poor Black health is a Vitamin D deficiency. One of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the main reasons a Vitamin D deficiency is so common in Blacks is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because Black skin absorbs more sunlight making more it more difficult 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to produce Vitamin D. Blacks have to spend more time in the sun in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to produce Vitamin D. The implication of Blacks, like Michelle 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obama, not having adequate amounts of Vitamin D are severe. My video 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> below explains those consequences as it pertain to Black women ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   I believe in keeping it real when it comes to health and we cannot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> act like race does not play when it comes to health. Blacks must also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realize that the sick care system does not give a hoot about Black 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Americans and has traditionally been anti-Black. The existence of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Black doctors means nothing. Black doctors operate in the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fraudulent system which has done nothing for Blacks and other ethnic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> groups for that matter. I say everyone avoid the sick care system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (doctors, hospitals, etc) unless you have been shot, been stabbed or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffered some really severe incident or accident.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Curtis Duncan talks in the video about why Vitamin D is not a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> profitable solution for the health care industry.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reminds me a little of Jacques Fresco's point that scientists and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineers often do more for society than politicians and political 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems. Not to say a good politician can't make a difference

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, Vitamin D promotion seems to be a mostly p2p-driven meme at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe Vitamin D might be an good signature issue for Michelle Obama 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related to wellness and health care reform?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> === on skin color issues as they relate to Vitamin D
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hope this doesn't come across as racist, but in the USA, I've seen 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> references to the fact that people of darker skins living in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> north of the USA have more problems with some specific health issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (including higher rates of some mental illness etc.) perhaps because 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of this Vitamin D issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, skin color is adapted to latitude (distance from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> equator). The farther north or south you are of the equator, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lighter you skin should be to get more Vitamin D (as a tradeoff 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> against increased skin cancer risk and sunburn risk if you lived 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nearer the equator with lighter skin). Of course, Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> supplements and sunscreen mean anyone of any skin darkness can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> healthily live anywhere they want to (and I think they should. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But if this Vitamin D issue is not understood, with pregnant mothers 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *not* getting enough Vitamin D (and babies after birth, and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> couple before they conceive), it may mean lots of needless suffering 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for dark skinned families living in more northern climates. And the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem is getting worse, since everyone spends more time indoors 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now, so presumably the Vitamin D deficiency issue is made even worse 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for people with darker skins with continued cultural changes to spend 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more time indoors and who may have had low levels of Vitamin D to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> begin with.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Clearly, something is known about this scientifically; something from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2006:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/136/4/1126">http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/136/4/1126</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D insufficiency is more prevalent among African Americans 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (blacks) than other Americans and, in North America, most young, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> healthy blacks do not achieve optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> concentrations at any time of year. This is primarily due to the fact 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that pigmentation reduces vitamin D production in the skin. Also, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from about puberty and onward, median vitamin D intakes of American 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> blacks are below recommended intakes in every age group, with or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without the inclusion of vitamin D from supplements. Despite their 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> low 25(OH)D levels, blacks have lower rates of osteoporotic 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fractures. This may result in part from bone-protective adaptations 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that include an intestinal resistance to the actions of 1,25(OH)2D 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and a skeletal resistance to the actions of parathyroid hormone 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (PTH). However, these mechanisms may not fully mitigate the harmful 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> skeletal effects of low 25(OH)D and elevated PTH in blacks, at least 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> among older individuals. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> apparent that vitamin D protects against other chronic conditions, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers, all of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which are as prevalent or more prevalent among blacks than whites. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Clinicians and educators should be encouraged to promote improved 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vitamin D status among blacks (and others) because of the low risk 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and low cost of vitamin D supplementation and its potentially broad 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> health benefits.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The new report about swine flu&#8217;s variable racial and ethnic impact 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opens yet another window into a novel virus that has killed at least 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 447 across the country. But disease specialists cautioned that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> preliminary data from Boston provide clues but no definitive answer.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a very important observation that we need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> track,&#8217;&#8217; said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, top disease tracker at the state 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Department of Public Health. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to overinterpret it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> until we have more and better information.&#8217;&#8217; ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   The Boston disease specialists found that of the 71 city residents 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hospitalized with swine flu, 49 percent were African-American, and 28 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> percent were Hispanic. In both cases, the hospitalization rates were 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> double each group&#8217;s overall presence in Boston&#8217;s population. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   The city investigators said the higher rates may also be a legacy 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of poverty and the demands of low-wage work. Parents in such jobs, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Barry said, find themselves unable to stay home to care for ailing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> children because a day away from work means a day without pay. As a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> result, ill children are sometimes sent to school.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But isn't this fascinating? The public health people say they do not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have a clue about why there would be any difference, and here we are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with one possible obvious answer. So, a simple thing like Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deficiency might be leading to all sorts of racially related issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which are otherwise linked to other explanations.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, how does this move from the blogosphere to public health people 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considering it? How can people in public health be missing stuff like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this? Maybe the focus on vaccination instead of nutrition or other 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wellness aspects (like sunlight exposure) has clouded and narrowed 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their perceptions?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Although, now that I look, I see this:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Despite Anti-Vitamin D Bias, CDC Stumbles on Deficiency Link to H1N1 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Deaths&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/22/Low-Vitamin-D-Increases-Flu-Death-Risk-in-Kids.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/22/Low-Vitamin-D-Increases-Flu-Death-Risk-in-Kids.aspx</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So far, Swine flu, H1N1, has killed thirty-six children in U.S. and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> analysis of CDC data indicates Vitamin D deficient children at higher 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> risk of death. The CDC did not realize they discovered this. However, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anyone familiar with the Vitamin D literature will recognize it. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Almost two-thirds of the dead children had epilepsy, cerebral palsy, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or other neurodevelopmental conditions like mental retardation. All 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of these neurological conditions are associated with childhood 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D deficiency. Exacerbating the problem further, many of these 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kids take anticonvulsant drugs, which lower Vitamin D levels. 58 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> million American children are Vitamin D deficient; 7.6 million are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> severely deficient. When researchers looked at more than 6,000 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> American kids (age one to 21) who were carefully selected to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representative of the average American child. 9 percent of the kids 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> had 25(OH)D levels less than 15 ng/mL and 70 percent had levels less 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than 30 ng/mL.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe this skin color issue is another too big kettle of worms, like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arguing over the science and cost-effectiveness and risk of vaccines? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But clearly, the skin color issue just makes this more extreme. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone is effected. And pediatricians can be clueless. When our 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> child was an infant, I asked my pediatrician if we should give extra 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D because it was winter and we live in the North, and she 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> said not to. How much was my child limited by that &quot;advice&quot; by a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> health care professional?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, here is a historic related example of possible political 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correctness perhaps preventing the understanding of Vitamin D issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (assuming this is true):

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Schizophrenia more common in those with dark skin
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Before I describe the remarkable paper from Harvard, I want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compliment researchers at the Saint Barthomew's Hospital in England 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for almost saying what most psychiatrists already know; the incidence 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of schizophrenia is much higher in people with dark skin. In the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1970s and 80s, that was an accepted fact, until charges of racism 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were leveled against the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spineless APA promptly did retrospective chart analyses and announced 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the incidence of schizophrenia is exactly &#8212; precisely &#8212; the same for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Blacks as it is for Whites. The ethnicity question is important as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Vitamin D theory is not tenable unless darker skin means a higher 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> incidence.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Actually, in 2007, a group at Columbia University appears to be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first to break with the APA's political correctness. Dr. Michaeline 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Bresnahan and her colleagues followed 12,000 children for up to 28 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> years after birth. African Americans were 3 (three) times more likely 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to develop schizophrenia than whites and socioeconomic factors could 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not explain away their findings.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also mentioned here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/005560.html">http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/005560.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The International Journal of Epidemiology states in the study 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> published in a recent issue, that: &quot;The data indicate substantially 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elevated rates of schizophrenia among African Americans in comparison 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with whites in this birth cohort&quot;.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;African Americans are over-represented in high-need populations that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are particularly at risk for mental illnesses: ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now, granted, as with any study, there can be reasons of bias in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> results. But, let's assume there is not for the moment, and there is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a genuine difference for some reason.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the more distant past, genetic reasons were blamed for racial 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differences, which was claimed to justify eugenics and racism. Thus 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the emphasis to show no disparities in something like schizophrenia, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even to the point of redoing data or analysis, as suggested above. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Still, this is an odd conclusion because if you look around, there 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are plenty of countries run for a long time by people with darker 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> skins than most US Americans, and often doing a better job of it. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now people see the issues as more social related to ongoing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discrimination, and as a legacy of slavery and poverty. For example, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> who would not get depressed more often if you had to deal with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> driving-while-black?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It will be controversial to suggest Vitamin D is a big factor in any 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differences, because, first it means admitting differences (which has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> become politically incorrect), and then suggesting some of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differences are related to a physical cause will mean other arguments 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> over other social spending being curtailed as if everything was 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> solved with some vitamins. There will also be arguments over whether, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> due to a Vitamin D deficiency, people of darker skins in the USA may 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be more at risk of mental issues leading to anti-social behavior, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whether that would justify racial profiling. That would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> potentially an explosive issue. That's an issue which would be a very 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hard to discuss socially for all sorts of reasons (including whether 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> political correctness stopped an examination of this issue that might 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have decades earlier led to improvements in the health of people with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dark skins). There are all sorts of ironic twists there, and all 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sorts of potential for racism and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For the record, I advocate a basic income for everyone of any age and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any color, as an economic equalizer: :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I think the US prison system has at least ten times too many 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prisoners than should be in there, of whatever colors:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The United States has the highest documented incarceration 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rate,[3][4] and total documented prison population in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world.[3][5][6] As of year-end 2007, a record 7.2 million people were 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behind bars, on probation or on parole. Of the total, 2.3 million 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were incarcerated.[7] More than 1 in 100 American adults were 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> incarcerated at the start of 2008. The People's Republic of China 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ranks second with 1.5 million, while having four times the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> population, thus having only about 18% of the US incarceration rate&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Still, what if not *all* the reasons for these health disparities or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crime disparities were socially caused by discrimination?  What if a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> significant part of it were just such a simple thing as people with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> darker skins living in the USA needing more Vitamin D than they get? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If that were true, this would be a tremendous ongoing tragedy of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> miscommunication from political correctness and embarrassment and so 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on. It might even involve a tremendously complex discussion of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> political correctness sometimes harming people it was trying to help, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> by, as above, forcing scientists to ignore obvious issues, while at 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the same time not trying to let them off the hook when they justify 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> racism:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=science+and+racism">http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=science+and+racism</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Still, even differences related to Vitamin D may well be considered 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> yet another continuation of the brutal legacy of slavery, from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ripping people from their homes and dumping them in another climate 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they were unfamiliar with in order to exploit them. So, even if there 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were differences in mental and physical health, including ones not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fixable by getting more Vitamin D now, the question of how any 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differences should be handled is a complex one.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And maybe something too awkward for most to discuss face-to-face? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I've been editing and re-editing this, and it still no doubt has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't want to suggest the USA does not have many social 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issues that need to be resolved; it does, big ones. Though often 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these days they are more problems of class than of race, based on 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this analysis by a black woman:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   &quot;Why Anti-Racism Will Fail, by Thandeka&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But, what if Vitamin D were an aspect of all this, anyway?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's controversial to suggest people with darker skins in the USA are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> statistically suffering more physical and mental issues of specific 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> types from birth, because that in turn might become fuel for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discrimination, including claims of bad genes or bad culture or bad 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attitude and so on. That is of course not my intent, even as I raise 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the issue of differences. So, it's a difficult issue to address, to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even admit to any disparities related to skin color.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Still, I bring it up anyway despite that risk because I don't want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> see anyone of any color denied their potential because of such a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simple and cheap thing like Vitamin D pills if that should prove 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> important (and, if this research on Vitamin D is to be believed, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is, very important).

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Your Health: Skin color matters in the vitamin D debate&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2009-04-19-your-health_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2009-04-19-your-health_N.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Can dark skin be a health hazard? It might be &#8212; if you are a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dark-skinned person who lives far from the equator, gets little sun 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exposure and consumes little vitamin D.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Just how much vitamin D Americans need and how they should get it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is under debate. Scientists also are debating evidence that vitamin 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> D, best known for building bones, can lower the risk of cancer, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> diabetes, heart disease and other ailments.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   And they are asking this intriguing question: Could varying vitamin 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> D levels contribute to the health gap between black and white Americans?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   John Flack, principal investigator at the Center for Urban and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> African American Health at Wayne State University, Detroit, says: &quot;I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think it's potentially a very important explanation for some of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differences, from hypertension to cancer to heart failure. The actual 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proof is not there, but it's plausible.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   But Flack adds that many factors contribute to African Americans' 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> poorer health. Studies suggest those factors include reduced access 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to health care, pervasive barriers to healthful living (for example, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> neighborhoods that lack fresh groceries), differences in income and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> education and the stress of racial inequality itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Solving those problems will be difficult, he says. Closing the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vitamin D gap could be easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   It won't be as easy as recommending more sun exposure, however. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Though someone in Boston with pale skin can get adequate vitamin D by 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exposing their arms and legs to the sun for 10 to 15 minutes twice a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> week in the summer, someone with the darkest skin might need two 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hours of exposure each time, Holick says. &quot;It's impractical,&quot; he 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> says, and it also darkens skin, which many people find cosmetically 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unacceptable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Dermatologists also warn that sun exposure increases the risk of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> skin cancer and wrinkling, even in dark-skinned people. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, lots of cans of worms here.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And obviously, there are nutritional issues that have nothing to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with race but may have everything to do with poverty or culture, like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> getting enough Omega-3 fatty acids or various other nutrients. So, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there are all sorts of interactions in the USA between race, class, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> poverty, discrimination, and health. So, there is unlikely to be just 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one issue that explains everything, even if this Vitamin D issues may 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be important.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If there is any truth to too little Vitamin D leading to more 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> physical and mental problems, and that this may have affected the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> African American experience in the USA negatively, then African 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Americans have been the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; of vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deficiency in the USA? And, maybe there will eventually need to be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deep rethinking of many aspects of US history? And even, one can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wonder what to make of the fact that President Obama (who just won a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Nobel Peace Prize today) was conceived and raised as a young boy in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sunny Hawaii? What would the USA have been like if more people with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dark skins could have reached their potential? How many more &quot;peace 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prizes&quot; would the USA have won?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, it seems like almost everyone needs more Vitamin D. As we all 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spend more time indoors in front of screens, it would seem that skin 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> color won't matter much, and we will all need to take the same amount 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of Vitamin D supplements, whatever our skin color. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps this need for Vitamin D supplements will more and more even 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> include people with dark skins living near the equator and spending 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more and more time indoors?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, a big, big can of worms for all sorts of reasons.
