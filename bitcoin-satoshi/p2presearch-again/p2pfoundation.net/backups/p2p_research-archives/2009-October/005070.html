<PRE>Just sent a note on this to the White House, via their public email form.

Not saying it won't be ignored, but sometimes the easiest things are worth 
trying first. :-)

Policy Comment on Health Care

There is a growing awareness that Vitamin D deficiency may have serious 
health impacts, especially among African Americans. Increasing the amount of 
Vitamin D a person gets through more sunlight exposure or supplements may 
reduce a variety of illnesses including the flu. This may be an important 
signature issue that Michelle Obama could help with.

Anyway, this is a note from a Princeton classmate of Michelle (we're both 
class of 1985). I hope it can help prevent illness among many people and 
allow many more people to live a long life of abundance and joy.

All the best in continuing to work towards world peace and prosperity.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Race is always a hot topic here but people always seem to neglect 
</I>&gt;<i> discussing the topic of race and health. If it is discussed, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> always a matter of stating that Blacks or other minorities are not 
</I>&gt;<i> getting enough treatment and early detection particularly in the realm 
</I>&gt;<i> of cancer. It is true though, that Blacks do have higher rates of every 
</I>&gt;<i> other disease you can think of. And money does not fix this health 
</I>&gt;<i> epidemic amongst Blacks as we have seen rich Black celebrities such as 
</I>&gt;<i> Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes die from degenerative and preventable 
</I>&gt;<i> diseases. However Blacks and Whites do have different health concerns 
</I>&gt;<i> and challenges. It is not because Blacks are inferior or have bad genes. 
</I>&gt;<i> Blacks have different diets and a large percentage of Blacks are on the 
</I>&gt;<i> low end of the economic bracket and do not have access to healthy foods 
</I>&gt;<i> (That is not to excuse bad dietary habits by Blacks). Historically, 
</I>&gt;<i> Blacks have also been unable to receive treatments from the medical 
</I>&gt;<i> establishment and have even been subject to crimes like the Tuskegee 
</I>&gt;<i> Experiment. So as a health researcher while researching general topics 
</I>&gt;<i> on health and wellness, I definitely sought to know why Blacks have a 
</I>&gt;<i> myriad of health problems. One of the main reasons for poor Black health 
</I>&gt;<i> is a Vitamin D deficiency. One of the main reasons a Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;<i> deficiency is so common in Blacks is because Black skin absorbs more 
</I>&gt;<i> sunlight making more it more difficult to produce Vitamin D. Blacks have 
</I>&gt;<i> to spend more time in the sun in order to produce Vitamin D. The 
</I>&gt;<i> implication of Blacks, like Michelle Obama, not having adequate amounts 
</I>&gt;<i> of Vitamin D are severe. My video below explains those consequences as 
</I>&gt;<i> it pertain to Black women ...
</I>&gt;<i>   I believe in keeping it real when it comes to health and we cannot act 
</I>&gt;<i> like race does not play when it comes to health. Blacks must also 
</I>&gt;<i> realize that the sick care system does not give a hoot about Black 
</I>&gt;<i> Americans and has traditionally been anti-Black. The existence of Black 
</I>&gt;<i> doctors means nothing. Black doctors operate in the same fraudulent 
</I>&gt;<i> system which has done nothing for Blacks and other ethnic groups for 
</I>&gt;<i> that matter. I say everyone avoid the sick care system (doctors, 
</I>&gt;<i> hospitals, etc) unless you have been shot, been stabbed or suffered some 
</I>&gt;<i> really severe incident or accident.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Curtis Duncan talks in the video about why Vitamin D is not a profitable 
</I>&gt;<i> solution for the health care industry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reminds me a little of Jacques Fresco's point that scientists and 
</I>&gt;<i> engineers often do more for society than politicians and political 
</I>&gt;<i> systems. Not to say a good politician can't make a difference sometimes. 
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, Vitamin D promotion seems to be a mostly p2p-driven meme at this 
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe Vitamin D might be an good signature issue for Michelle Obama 
</I>&gt;<i> related to wellness and health care reform?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This Vitamin D issue affects everybody's health and happiness, whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> the color of your skin. From:

</I>&gt;<i> to get a lot more Vitamin D.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No one yet has a theory as to why Vit D works on flu. Of course it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most likely is something to do with calcium channels in cells, but we 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't know how or why yet. It is widely understood it has major 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> influence on heart disease, breast cancer, bowel cancer, bone 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> density, and several other cancers. It has emerged as sort of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;real&quot; vitamin C...which was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  hyped for a decade based on Linus Pauling's early understanding of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anti-oxidants and their implications. C is good too, but has nowhere 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> near
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  the health benefits of Vitamin D3 which if regularly supplemented 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would probably cut national health costs by 20% (and that number is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> widely circulated and discussed--some say as high as 25%). D3 is not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an anti-oxidant, but rather is really best described as a hormone.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed I would go so far as to say that if an adult did no other 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  aid their health, the science suggests that taking 4000-8000 IU of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> gelcap (not solid) Vitamin D3 ...not D2, is about the best thing you 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can do for yourself and it will cost less than 1/4 of a US dollar a day.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> === on skin color issues as they relate to Vitamin D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope this doesn't come across as racist, but in the USA, I've seen 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> references to the fact that people of darker skins living in the north 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the USA have more problems with some specific health issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (including higher rates of some mental illness etc.) perhaps because 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of this Vitamin D issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, skin color is adapted to latitude (distance from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equator). The farther north or south you are of the equator, the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lighter you skin should be to get more Vitamin D (as a tradeoff 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against increased skin cancer risk and sunburn risk if you lived 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nearer the equator with lighter skin). Of course, Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supplements and sunscreen mean anyone of any skin darkness can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> healthily live anywhere they want to (and I think they should. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if this Vitamin D issue is not understood, with pregnant mothers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *not* getting enough Vitamin D (and babies after birth, and the couple 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before they conceive), it may mean lots of needless suffering for dark 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skinned families living in more northern climates. And the problem is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting worse, since everyone spends more time indoors now, so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presumably the Vitamin D deficiency issue is made even worse for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people with darker skins with continued cultural changes to spend more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time indoors and who may have had low levels of Vitamin D to begin with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Clearly, something is known about this scientifically; something from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2006:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/136/4/1126">http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/136/4/1126</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D insufficiency is more prevalent among African Americans 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (blacks) than other Americans and, in North America, most young, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> healthy blacks do not achieve optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concentrations at any time of year. This is primarily due to the fact 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that pigmentation reduces vitamin D production in the skin. Also, from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about puberty and onward, median vitamin D intakes of American blacks 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are below recommended intakes in every age group, with or without the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inclusion of vitamin D from supplements. Despite their low 25(OH)D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> levels, blacks have lower rates of osteoporotic fractures. This may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result in part from bone-protective adaptations that include an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intestinal resistance to the actions of 1,25(OH)2D and a skeletal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resistance to the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanisms may not fully mitigate the harmful skeletal effects of low 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 25(OH)D and elevated PTH in blacks, at least among older individuals. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly apparent that vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protects against other chronic conditions, including cardiovascular 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disease, diabetes, and some cancers, all of which are as prevalent or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more prevalent among blacks than whites. Clinicians and educators 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be encouraged to promote improved vitamin D status among blacks 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and others) because of the low risk and low cost of vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supplementation and its potentially broad health benefits.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The place where I saw that first was in reference to minority families 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the North being blamed for abuse because of broken bones in their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> children, when the problem may really just be rickets (Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deficiency).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The debate: Rickets or child abuse?&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, is there a possibility of increased H1N1 flu severity related to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skin color and Vitamin D? See:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Cases of swine flu higher among city blacks, Hispanics&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/08/18/cases_of_swine_flu_higher_among_bostons_blacks_hispanics/">http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/08/18/cases_of_swine_flu_higher_among_bostons_blacks_hispanics/</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The new report about swine flu&#8217;s variable racial and ethnic impact 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opens yet another window into a novel virus that has killed at least 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 447 across the country. But disease specialists cautioned that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preliminary data from Boston provide clues but no definitive answer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a very important observation that we need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> track,&#8217;&#8217; said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, top disease tracker at the state 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Department of Public Health. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to overinterpret it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until we have more and better information.&#8217;&#8217; ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The Boston disease specialists found that of the 71 city residents 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hospitalized with swine flu, 49 percent were African-American, and 28 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> percent were Hispanic. In both cases, the hospitalization rates were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> double each group&#8217;s overall presence in Boston&#8217;s population. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The city investigators said the higher rates may also be a legacy of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poverty and the demands of low-wage work. Parents in such jobs, Barry 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said, find themselves unable to stay home to care for ailing children 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because a day away from work means a day without pay. As a result, ill 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> children are sometimes sent to school.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But isn't this fascinating? The public health people say they do not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a clue about why there would be any difference, and here we are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with one possible obvious answer. So, a simple thing like Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deficiency might be leading to all sorts of racially related issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which are otherwise linked to other explanations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, how does this move from the blogosphere to public health people 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considering it? How can people in public health be missing stuff like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this? Maybe the focus on vaccination instead of nutrition or other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wellness aspects (like sunlight exposure) has clouded and narrowed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their perceptions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although, now that I look, I see this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Despite Anti-Vitamin D Bias, CDC Stumbles on Deficiency Link to H1N1 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deaths&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/22/Low-Vitamin-D-Increases-Flu-Death-Risk-in-Kids.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/22/Low-Vitamin-D-Increases-Flu-Death-Risk-in-Kids.aspx</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So far, Swine flu, H1N1, has killed thirty-six children in U.S. and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis of CDC data indicates Vitamin D deficient children at higher 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risk of death. The CDC did not realize they discovered this. However, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone familiar with the Vitamin D literature will recognize it. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Almost two-thirds of the dead children had epilepsy, cerebral palsy, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or other neurodevelopmental conditions like mental retardation. All of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these neurological conditions are associated with childhood Vitamin D 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deficiency. Exacerbating the problem further, many of these kids take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anticonvulsant drugs, which lower Vitamin D levels. 58 million 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> American children are Vitamin D deficient; 7.6 million are severely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deficient. When researchers looked at more than 6,000 American kids 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (age one to 21) who were carefully selected to be representative of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the average American child. 9 percent of the kids had 25(OH)D levels 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less than 15 ng/mL and 70 percent had levels less than 30 ng/mL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe this skin color issue is another too big kettle of worms, like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguing over the science and cost-effectiveness and risk of vaccines? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But clearly, the skin color issue just makes this more extreme. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone is effected. And pediatricians can be clueless. When our 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child was an infant, I asked my pediatrician if we should give extra 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D because it was winter and we live in the North, and she said 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not to. How much was my child limited by that &quot;advice&quot; by a health 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> care professional?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, here is a historic related example of possible political 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctness perhaps preventing the understanding of Vitamin D issues 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (assuming this is true):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/vitamin-d-and-schizophrenia.shtml">http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/vitamin-d-and-schizophrenia.shtml</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Schizophrenia more common in those with dark skin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Before I describe the remarkable paper from Harvard, I want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compliment researchers at the Saint Barthomew's Hospital in England 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for almost saying what most psychiatrists already know; the incidence 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of schizophrenia is much higher in people with dark skin. In the 1970s 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and 80s, that was an accepted fact, until charges of racism were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leveled against the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spineless APA promptly did retrospective chart analyses and announced 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the incidence of schizophrenia is exactly &#8212; precisely &#8212; the same for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blacks as it is for Whites. The ethnicity question is important as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vitamin D theory is not tenable unless darker skin means a higher 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incidence.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Actually, in 2007, a group at Columbia University appears to be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first to break with the APA's political correctness. Dr. Michaeline 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bresnahan and her colleagues followed 12,000 children for up to 28 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> years after birth. African Americans were 3 (three) times more likely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to develop schizophrenia than whites and socioeconomic factors could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not explain away their findings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also mentioned here:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The International Journal of Epidemiology states in the study 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> published in a recent issue, that: &quot;The data indicate substantially 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elevated rates of schizophrenia among African Americans in comparison 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with whites in this birth cohort&quot;.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;African Americans are over-represented in high-need populations that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are particularly at risk for mental illnesses: ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, granted, as with any study, there can be reasons of bias in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results. But, let's assume there is not for the moment, and there is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> genuine difference for some reason.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the more distant past, genetic reasons were blamed for racial 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences, which was claimed to justify eugenics and racism. Thus 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the emphasis to show no disparities in something like schizophrenia, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even to the point of redoing data or analysis, as suggested above. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, this is an odd conclusion because if you look around, there are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plenty of countries run for a long time by people with darker skins 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than most US Americans, and often doing a better job of it. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now people see the issues as more social related to ongoing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discrimination, and as a legacy of slavery and poverty. For example, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who would not get depressed more often if you had to deal with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> driving-while-black?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It will be controversial to suggest Vitamin D is a big factor in any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences, because, first it means admitting differences (which has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become politically incorrect), and then suggesting some of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences are related to a physical cause will mean other arguments 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over other social spending being curtailed as if everything was solved 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with some vitamins. There will also be arguments over whether, due to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a Vitamin D deficiency, people of darker skins in the USA may be more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at risk of mental issues leading to anti-social behavior, and whether 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would justify racial profiling. That would be potentially an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explosive issue. That's an issue which would be a very hard to discuss 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> socially for all sorts of reasons (including whether political 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctness stopped an examination of this issue that might have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decades earlier led to improvements in the health of people with dark 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skins). There are all sorts of ironic twists there, and all sorts of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potential for racism and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the record, I advocate a basic income for everyone of any age and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any color, as an economic equalizer: :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I think the US prison system has at least ten times too many 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prisoners than should be in there, of whatever colors:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The United States has the highest documented incarceration 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rate,[3][4] and total documented prison population in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world.[3][5][6] As of year-end 2007, a record 7.2 million people were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind bars, on probation or on parole. Of the total, 2.3 million were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incarcerated.[7] More than 1 in 100 American adults were incarcerated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the start of 2008. The People's Republic of China ranks second with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.5 million, while having four times the population, thus having only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about 18% of the US incarceration rate&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, what if not *all* the reasons for these health disparities or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crime disparities were socially caused by discrimination?  What if a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant part of it were just such a simple thing as people with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> darker skins living in the USA needing more Vitamin D than they get? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If that were true, this would be a tremendous ongoing tragedy of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> miscommunication from political correctness and embarrassment and so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on. It might even involve a tremendously complex discussion of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political correctness sometimes harming people it was trying to help, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by, as above, forcing scientists to ignore obvious issues, while at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same time not trying to let them off the hook when they justify 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> racism:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=science+and+racism">http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=science+and+racism</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, even differences related to Vitamin D may well be considered 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet another continuation of the brutal legacy of slavery, from ripping 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people from their homes and dumping them in another climate they were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfamiliar with in order to exploit them. So, even if there were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences in mental and physical health, including ones not fixable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by getting more Vitamin D now, the question of how any differences 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be handled is a complex one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And maybe something too awkward for most to discuss face-to-face? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I've been editing and re-editing this, and it still no doubt has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't want to suggest the USA does not have many social 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues that need to be resolved; it does, big ones. Though often these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> days they are more problems of class than of race, based on this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis by a black woman:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   &quot;Why Anti-Racism Will Fail, by Thandeka&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga99/238thandeka.html">http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga99/238thandeka.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, what if Vitamin D were an aspect of all this, anyway?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's controversial to suggest people with darker skins in the USA are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statistically suffering more physical and mental issues of specific 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types from birth, because that in turn might become fuel for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discrimination, including claims of bad genes or bad culture or bad 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attitude and so on. That is of course not my intent, even as I raise 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the issue of differences. So, it's a difficult issue to address, to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even admit to any disparities related to skin color.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, I bring it up anyway despite that risk because I don't want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see anyone of any color denied their potential because of such a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple and cheap thing like Vitamin D pills if that should prove 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important (and, if this research on Vitamin D is to be believed, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is, very important).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example from this year, showing how this issue is heating up:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Your Health: Skin color matters in the vitamin D debate&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2009-04-19-your-health_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2009-04-19-your-health_N.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Can dark skin be a health hazard? It might be &#8212; if you are a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dark-skinned person who lives far from the equator, gets little sun 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposure and consumes little vitamin D.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Just how much vitamin D Americans need and how they should get it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under debate. Scientists also are debating evidence that vitamin D, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best known for building bones, can lower the risk of cancer, diabetes, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heart disease and other ailments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   And they are asking this intriguing question: Could varying vitamin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> D levels contribute to the health gap between black and white Americans?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   John Flack, principal investigator at the Center for Urban and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> African American Health at Wayne State University, Detroit, says: &quot;I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it's potentially a very important explanation for some of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences, from hypertension to cancer to heart failure. The actual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proof is not there, but it's plausible.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   But Flack adds that many factors contribute to African Americans' 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poorer health. Studies suggest those factors include reduced access to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> health care, pervasive barriers to healthful living (for example, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighborhoods that lack fresh groceries), differences in income and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> education and the stress of racial inequality itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Solving those problems will be difficult, he says. Closing the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vitamin D gap could be easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   It won't be as easy as recommending more sun exposure, however. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Though someone in Boston with pale skin can get adequate vitamin D by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposing their arms and legs to the sun for 10 to 15 minutes twice a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> week in the summer, someone with the darkest skin might need two hours 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of exposure each time, Holick says. &quot;It's impractical,&quot; he says, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it also darkens skin, which many people find cosmetically unacceptable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Dermatologists also warn that sun exposure increases the risk of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skin cancer and wrinkling, even in dark-skinned people. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, lots of cans of worms here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And obviously, there are nutritional issues that have nothing to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with race but may have everything to do with poverty or culture, like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting enough Omega-3 fatty acids or various other nutrients. So, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are all sorts of interactions in the USA between race, class, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poverty, discrimination, and health. So, there is unlikely to be just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one issue that explains everything, even if this Vitamin D issues may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there is any truth to too little Vitamin D leading to more physical 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mental problems, and that this may have affected the African 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> American experience in the USA negatively, then African Americans have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; of vitamin D deficiency in the USA? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, maybe there will eventually need to be a deep rethinking of many 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aspects of US history? And even, one can wonder what to make of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact that President Obama (who just won a Nobel Peace Prize today) was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceived and raised as a young boy in sunny Hawaii? What would the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> USA have been like if more people with dark skins could have reached 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their potential? How many more &quot;peace prizes&quot; would the USA have won?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Negro_College_Fund">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Negro_College_Fund</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In 1972, the UNCF adopted, as its motto, the maxim, &quot;A mind is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrible thing to waste.&quot; This maxim has become one of the most widely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognized slogans in advertising history.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could a few hundred dollars worth of Vitamin D during pregnancy and in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> childhood per dark skinned mother and baby made a bigger difference 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than many thousands of dollars spent later on college? Difficult 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions to explore? And was political correctness the reason this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was not understood decades ago?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, the first three years (four including pregnancy) are very 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important for any child of any skin color:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.zerotothree.org/">http://www.zerotothree.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;We welcome you to ZERO TO THREE&#8217;s website. ZERO TO THREE is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> national nonprofit organization that informs, trains and supports 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> professionals, policymakers and parents in their efforts to improve 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the lives of infants and toddlers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, it's hard to know if Vitamin D really would make such a big 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference compared to other things? No doubt, this will be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contentious issue for years to come.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/treatment.shtml">http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/treatment.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, it seems like almost everyone needs more Vitamin D. As we all 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend more time indoors in front of screens, it would seem that skin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> color won't matter much, and we will all need to take the same amount 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Vitamin D supplements, whatever our skin color. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps this need for Vitamin D supplements will more and more even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include people with dark skins living near the equator and spending 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more and more time indoors?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, a big, big can of worms for all sorts of reasons.
