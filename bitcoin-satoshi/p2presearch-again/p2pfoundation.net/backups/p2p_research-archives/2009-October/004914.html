<PRE>Paul,

just in case, if you could formalize the info on cooperative games, it would
be a great blog entry ... its hard otherwise to you use your interesting
material, because it usually goes in all directions and is really written
for email conversations ...

&gt;<i> Here is one concern about a book award contest -- or, alternatively,
</I>&gt;<i> consider this as a book nomination for the contest: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;No Contest: The Case Against Competition&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/No-Contest-Case-Against-Competition/dp/0395631254">http://www.amazon.com/No-Contest-Case-Against-Competition/dp/0395631254</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Contending that competition in all areas -- school, family, sports and
</I>&gt;<i> business -- is destructive, and that success so achieved is at the expense
</I>&gt;<i> of another's failure, Kohn, a correspondent for USA Today, advocates a
</I>&gt;<i> restructuring of our institutions to replace competition with cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i> He persuasively demonstrates how the ingrained American myth that
</I>&gt;<i> competition is the only normal and desirable way of life -- from Little
</I>&gt;<i> Leagues to the presidency -- is counterproductive, personally and for the
</I>&gt;<i> national economy, and how psychologically it poisons relationships, fosters
</I>&gt;<i> anxiety and takes the fun out of work and play. He charges that competition
</I>&gt;<i> is a learned phenomenon and denies that it builds character and self-esteem.
</I>&gt;<i> Kohn's measures to encourage cooperation in lieu of competition include
</I>&gt;<i> promoting noncompetitive games, eliminating scholastic grades and
</I>&gt;<i> substitution of mutual security for national security.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if there must be a contest, how about a &quot;contest&quot; where people can
</I>&gt;<i> nominate any book that is vaguely p2p (maybe have a filtering process of
</I>&gt;<i> yes/no that it includes p2p themes) and then pick a winner randomly from the
</I>&gt;<i> list of entries? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, what exactly is the point of this award and this contest? Is it to
</I>&gt;<i> promote p2p cooperation on making books? :-) Or to promote individual
</I>&gt;<i> authors? Or to promote people writing new books? What are we trying to
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People also have various abilities that are strengths and weaknesses in
</I>&gt;<i> different situations, so even encouraging an author after-the-fact may not
</I>&gt;<i> be a success, as I wrote here: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Post-Scarcity Princeton, or, Reading between the lines of PAW for
</I>&gt;<i> prospective Princeton students, or, the Health Risks of Heart Disease &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, the very skills I use to write this essay are the very height of the
</I>&gt;<i> old &quot;Princeton&quot; in some ways: alienation (elitism?), destructiveness
</I>&gt;<i> (competitiveness?), dissatisfaction (excellence?), and so on. These are not
</I>&gt;<i> the things Princeton most needs most going forward, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> inclusiveness, cooperation, and effectiveness. Often our greatest strengths
</I>&gt;<i> are also our greatest weaknesses, depending on the context. For another
</I>&gt;<i> example, the same habits of mind that help me be a great programmer in some
</I>&gt;<i> contexts -- perfectionism (great code), paranoia (useful for debugging),
</I>&gt;<i> isolation (great for concentrating) and so on -- are also often huge
</I>&gt;<i> weaknesses in dealing with people, where acceptance, trust, and
</I>&gt;<i> gregariousness are usually key. So, being able to write this essay may prove
</I>&gt;<i> my incompetence to do anything with the ideas in it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not nominating that book unless the prize is selected randomly. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also related:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Towards a free matter economy (Part 1): Information as matter, matter as
</I>&gt;<i> information
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/free_matter_economy?page=0%2C1">http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/free_matter_economy?page=0%2C1</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Prizes have been proposed as a much better solution than grants, and it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> not hard to see why: With a prize, the donor does not have to try to predict
</I>&gt;<i> in advance who can achieve the proposed goal, nor how it will be achieved.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, applicants don&#8217;t have to prove anything to the donor about their
</I>&gt;<i> past performance&#8212;they just have to step up to the task at hand and do it.
</I>&gt;<i> That means there&#8217;s no &#8220;artificial&#8221; barrier to entry. The success of the
</I>&gt;<i> Ansari X-Prize, recently won by Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites with Space
</I>&gt;<i> Ship One is a good example of how well prizes can work.[10, 11]
</I>&gt;<i>  Except for one problem, of course: money. Winning prizes is usually only
</I>&gt;<i> an option for people already rich enough to fund their own research. Prizes
</I>&gt;<i> do not provide money when it is most needed&#8212;during the development process,
</I>&gt;<i> so they do little for people with ideas but no money. True, you can look for
</I>&gt;<i> investors, but you still have to convince them in advance that you can do
</I>&gt;<i> the job. It&#8217;s no coincidence that so many entrepreneurs started out in
</I>&gt;<i> marketing!
</I>&gt;<i>  It&#8217;s also instructive to note some less-appealing details of the X-prize
</I>&gt;<i> competition: once Space Ship One emerged as the clear leader, some
</I>&gt;<i> competitors began to slack off, because there was no second place to strive
</I>&gt;<i> for. Prizes fundamentally encourage competition and discourage cooperation,
</I>&gt;<i> and they have all the benefits and dangers of competition as a result. In a
</I>&gt;<i> field where effective cooperation seems to be essential to produce real
</I>&gt;<i> quality, they can be seriously detrimental, as can be seen by the problems
</I>&gt;<i> encountered by both Source Exchange and Co-Source -- the two &#8220;reverse
</I>&gt;<i> auction&#8221; funding sites Raymond mentions in &#8220;The Magic Cauldron&#8221;, which are
</I>&gt;<i> now long dead.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two related Google searches:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=cooperative+games">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=cooperative+games</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example result, and it is another book to nominate:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Guide to Cooperative Games for Social Change&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm">http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Everyday  in communities around the world, youth activists, youth workers
</I>&gt;<i> and educators are looking for powerful, purposeful activities that can
</I>&gt;<i> change the world. At the same time, young people want to connect with adults
</I>&gt;<i> in powerful relationships where they can actually change the world. The
</I>&gt;<i> Guide to Cooperative Games for Social Change  provides a resource for people
</I>&gt;<i> who want more from youth activities.
</I>&gt;<i>  The Guide features a powerful introduction to cooperative games, carefully
</I>&gt;<i> detailing their relevance for activists and educators. It continues to
</I>&gt;<i> provide clear, concise summaries of more than two dozen activities,
</I>&gt;<i> including icebreakers, &quot;funners,&quot; and closers. Each description details
</I>&gt;<i> exactly how the activity can be facilitated, as well as the equipment, time,
</I>&gt;<i> and space needed.
</I>&gt;<i>  Since 2003 this document has been downloaded more than 10,000 times from
</I>&gt;<i> The Freechild Project website. This revision features a clean, crisp layout
</I>&gt;<i> and a fast download. Also, for the first time Freechild's parent
</I>&gt;<i> organization offers print versions of this booklet for practitioners.
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.commonaction.org/gamesguide.pdf">http://www.commonaction.org/gamesguide.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example from that book:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Human Scissors, Paper, Rock
</I>&gt;<i> Props: None
</I>&gt;<i> Purpose: Fun, energy-building
</I>&gt;<i>  Procedure: This is the human-size version of scissors/paper/rock. The end
</I>&gt;<i> zones need  to be clearly defined. To begin, each team huddles and decides
</I>&gt;<i> on which play to run- either rock, paper or scissors. Then the two teams
</I>&gt;<i> meet in the playing area. If your team&#8217;s symbol wins, you chase the other
</I>&gt;<i> team back into its end zone, trying to tag the team members before they get
</I>&gt;<i> there. If your team&#8217;s symbol loses, you must dash back to your own end zone
</I>&gt;<i> before you&#8217;re caught. Those people who get caught change to the other team.
</I>&gt;<i> The game ends when everyone is on the same team.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, Tomas' idea is already a big success as we cooperate in building on it.
</I>&gt;<i> :-) I had never seen that book before. Or that game. I'm learning something
</I>&gt;<i> already. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a small company in Canada that makes and sells cooperative board
</I>&gt;<i> games, BTW, which I will nominate as they have a book:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/">http://www.familypastimes.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/together.html">http://www.familypastimes.com/together.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Play as friends, not as enemies! Our games foster the spirit of
</I>&gt;<i> co-operation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community,
</I>&gt;<i> bring in the harvest, complete a space exploration... They are never against
</I>&gt;<i> each other.
</I>&gt;<i>  After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring
</I>&gt;<i> out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in
</I>&gt;<i> most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy
</I>&gt;<i> their armies &#8212; in other words, to get rid of one another! We soon learn how
</I>&gt;<i> to pick on the other person's weaknesses in order to win the game.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Their book:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Co-op Games Manual&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.familypastimes.com/Books/gamesmanual.html">http://www.familypastimes.com/Books/gamesmanual.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This softcover book includes over 170 co-op games and activities for ages
</I>&gt;<i> 3 to 12+. Little or no equipment is required. For small and large groups,
</I>&gt;<i> from pre-schoolers through primary ages and also junior high level. Play
</I>&gt;<i> these games in open spaces such as a farm, park or street, or the indoor
</I>&gt;<i> spaces of a home living room, a school classroom, gym, etc. Try a co-op
</I>&gt;<i> birthday party, co-op recess time, even a co-op play day.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A book co-written by someone with a &quot;Humor Project&quot; based near me:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Playfair: A sampling of cooperative games&quot; by Matt Weinstein &amp; Joel
</I>&gt;<i> Goodman
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC13/Playfair.htm">http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC13/Playfair.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;THE POSSIBILITIES FOR COOPERATIVE PLAY ARE VAST. In our book, we describe
</I>&gt;<i> over sixty different games and activities we use in our PLAYFAIRS, and those
</I>&gt;<i> sixty are just a small corner of a very large field. We don't have space for
</I>&gt;<i> anything like that here, but we would like to share six of these games to
</I>&gt;<i> give you a flavor for what is possible.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although it is true that some of the books above are not available for free
</I>&gt;<i> online. :-( So, maybe three categories of nominations (maybe with
</I>&gt;<i> sub-categories like Tomas said of fiction/non-fiction)? Free to change, free
</I>&gt;<i> to copy, and proprietary, with a random pick from each list? :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Selection - people propose books for the first round.  To pass into the
