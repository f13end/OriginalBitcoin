<PRE>Actually, my reply was not about you at all. 100% definitely was not
about you. But, was 100% about the model of spectrums that you were
proposing that we use.

&gt;<i> Hi Sam,
</I>&gt;<i> yes, and yes :-)
</I>&gt;<i> although initially I did not mean it to be a debate on my own motivations
</I>&gt;<i> and situation ,
</I>&gt;<i> but simply some comments encouraging to visualize and position ourselves
</I>&gt;<i> along such inter-related spectrum's,
</I>&gt;<i> as I notice that there may be differences in vision we ( some people on this
</I>&gt;<i> list ) may be building on according to these various&#160;spectrum's.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, Paul or Nathan&#160;mentioning increased automation, in certain
</I>&gt;<i> contexts, ...
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, I imagine we can also use such spectrum's to position not only our
</I>&gt;<i> visions, but our current situations :-)
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to use such spectrum's not to limit ourselves into a linear form,
</I>&gt;<i> but to use various linear forms to position them on a multi-dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> map/graph of such gradual spectrum's, and also understand the non-linear
</I>&gt;<i> relations between these spectrum's ...
</I>&gt;<i> So I believe it can&#160;resonate&#160;with what you seem to express in your last
</I>&gt;<i> reply Sam :-)
</I>&gt;<i> As for replying in relation to me, here goes ( for anyone interested in
</I>&gt;<i> knowing a bit more about Dante :-p &#160;) &#160;:
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> I also believe that there is no lack of &quot;work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It all depends how one defines &quot;work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> When I was younger, at school, I asked myself why &quot;the news&quot; was constantly
</I>&gt;<i> worried about &quot;lack of work&quot; when I saw so many things that needed to be
</I>&gt;<i> done. &#160;So I understood their concern was about &quot;paid work&quot;. &#160;On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, I could see that there was so much money in the social background in
</I>&gt;<i> which I grew in. ( not my parents, but the parents of the kids I went to
</I>&gt;<i> school with ). I understood it was an issue of decision making and power.
</I>&gt;<i> Today, I understand its about artificial scarcity through , for example,
</I>&gt;<i> money hoarding; a need for constantly growing the monetary mass through debt
</I>&gt;<i> as to pay for formerly created debt ( principal ) plus the interest ,
</I>&gt;<i> through creating new markets, as to avoid collapse , requiring growth,
</I>&gt;<i> including speculative growth ( bubbles ), but only if it leads to increased
</I>&gt;<i> profits and power for the ones that already have power and money. &#160;An
</I>&gt;<i> economic system at the service of the status quo of the structures of
</I>&gt;<i> power.
</I>&gt;<i> And so my own question becomes :
</I>&gt;<i> When power structures who have access to monetary creation ( through debt )
</I>&gt;<i> will have their needs satisfied without needing to pay a majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> population , how can the ones outside of the needs of a monetary system
</I>&gt;<i> servicing the power structures best reclaim inter-dependence
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;paid work&quot;, yes, its a lot about &quot;effective communication&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;selling&quot; our work to individuals or organizations that have access to
</I>&gt;<i> resources ( including, as you say, non monetary resources ) , organizations
</I>&gt;<i> of individuals that may see an interest in it.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this is how I was given the laptop computer on which I currently
</I>&gt;<i> write.
</I>&gt;<i> But I do not see this as a structural solution.
</I>&gt;<i> There are various approaches...
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in support at the level of peers...
</I>&gt;<i> I want to participate in the development of a radical solution, by trying to
</I>&gt;<i> envision and implement a software supporting human based computation
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I am not a programmer, I am thinking about this kind of solution (
</I>&gt;<i> draft ) :
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cashwiki.org/en/DebttoIntention">http://cashwiki.org/en/DebttoIntention</A>
</I>&gt;<i> As for me, my motivation , and my living strategy,&#160;after spending several
</I>&gt;<i> years of roaming around by hitch hiking,
</I>&gt;<i> is to re-converge locally, building up social networks and capital locally,
</I>&gt;<i> continue learning and connecting people interested in collaborating locally,
</I>&gt;<i> increasing autonomy through distributed inter-dependence,
</I>&gt;<i> and inspiring myself from what you are doing.
</I>&gt;<i> As I re-establish myself locally, I have more stability to find out about
</I>&gt;<i> funding opportunities, and potentially create local partnerships to fund
</I>&gt;<i> raise. &#160;This mailing list and all the converging work and inspirations from
</I>&gt;<i> the people on this list can empower me in setting up a clear vision for
</I>&gt;<i> implementations at various levels of abstraction :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree. &#160;There are a number of important differentiations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Or rather, I d like to see it as a number of &quot;spectrum's&quot; which ideally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could be visualized in a multidimensional graph :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; See below in bold for a few spectrum's I notice in our conversation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and feel free to suggest added related&#160;spectrum's...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps we could use it to make graphical representations and situate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ourselves ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The first one you reacted to is paid work vs unpaid work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ( or perhaps also &quot;pay to work&quot; ? )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;What is work&quot; ? What is &quot;paid work&quot; ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What is &quot;paid work&quot; in the current dominant monetary paradigm ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; And how is &quot;work&quot; recognized in potential other economic systems ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ( does it still need to be recognized ? will we pay to have our work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; recognized ? such as students in universities ? - unless they are paid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; working on their Phd - &#160;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think these are good questions. I'd also like to add: *Why* are you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing this work? Are you doing it for the pay?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What people are doing is important. Why they are doing what they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing is vital to understanding the system they see themselves as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being part of.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If power structures do not need workers anymore, I imagine it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unlikely a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; majority of the population would get paid for working for what machines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could make cheaper, faster, and without questioning authority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If machines do the work that we do now, we'll &#160;turn our attentions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new types of work (maybe figuring out how to turn all of mass around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us into computers and digital storage). Or, a dystopian outcome is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freed up from the need to labor for survival, we turn on each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps people would get paid for not revolting themselves against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; status quo of power structures ? &#160;Or perhaps it is cheaper to pay police
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; army forces to control parts of the population that are not required to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; service the dominant control/monetary system ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At least here in the US, there is enough work for at least 40 years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just re-making the education system :-) Wait until experience some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more collapses of globalized infrastructure. There's enough work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every human on the planet in recreating our artificially globalized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure into networks of local systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Or perhaps its even &quot;cheaper&quot; ( in terms of coercive control ) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; eradicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; such populations that would become to create their own systems and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; too autonomous ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If we tend towards such a situation, I find it interesting to understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to create an alternative economy where it is possible to produce for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ourselves, preferably by using existing technologies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I already feel I am in such a situation : I do not seem to be servicing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; direct needs of the status quo of power structures, so as a result I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; paid for trying to change it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My approach is to convince them to try something really, really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different, and get them to fund that. It's up to you how you ask to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funded. You can ask for money, or you could ask for them to give you a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> piece of land, and enough materials to build a structure on it. etc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that &quot;spectrum&quot; could be intepreted by some people as meaning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;from one extreme to another&quot;. A finite range, with linear progression
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from one end to another. And so, the inevitble question becomes &quot;where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you you on this spectrum?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if I get payed to produce things that people do not pay for?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where do I fit on this spectrum? Where on the spectrum is the model of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convincing people who rely on enclosed resources to invest in creating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common pool resources that they participate in co-managing and using?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a picture of what I do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want to advocate that there are more possibilities than may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apparent if you view the picture through a &quot;spectrum&quot; of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibilities. The actual nature of the system is non-linear, and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is not easy to see it through a linear lens.
