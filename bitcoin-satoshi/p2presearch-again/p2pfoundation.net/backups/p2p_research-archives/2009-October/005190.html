<PRE>Hi Matt,

thanks for this, I saw this too late though, so it is both added to the old
article, and will be published independently on the 24th,

many thanks again,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  City governance and open-source programming never seemed like a likely
</I>&gt;<i> marriage. However, emerging initiatives have been working towards it, and
</I>&gt;<i> have received a boost of popular support through Obama&#8217;s call for open
</I>&gt;<i> government. When NYC&#8217;s Mayor Bloomberg launched the Big Apps competition
</I>&gt;<i> this past June, he invited individuals and groups to program applications
</I>&gt;<i> that make government data sets accessible to the public &#8212; solidifying that
</I>&gt;<i> technology can contribute to improved quality of life. Applications created
</I>&gt;<i> in response to Bloomberg&#8217;s decisions will join the crowd-sourced initiatives
</I>&gt;<i> that already exist in New York City, and already explore methods that can
</I>&gt;<i> offer residents not only information, but a place to gain a sense of
</I>&gt;<i> community, to exchange ideas and to visualize space digitally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For more read Olivia Chen&#8217;s overview
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/10/07/crowd-sourced-initiatives-to-create-a-more-livable-new-york-city/">http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/10/07/crowd-sourced-initiatives-to-create-a-more-livable-new-york-city/</A>&gt;in
</I>&gt;<i> Inhabitat, on New York&#8217;s crowdsourced open city initiatives.  Below is a
</I>&gt;<i> response from Matt Cooperrider, organizer of the Open Government NYC meetup
</I>&gt;<i> group &lt;<A HREF="http://meetup.com/opengovnyc">http://meetup.com/opengovnyc</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>  While Mayor Bloomberg's recent initiatives are innovative and
</I>&gt;<i> forward-looking, perhaps his most valuable role for the openness movement in
</I>&gt;<i> New York CIty has been as a foil.  This is a mayor so strong that he
</I>&gt;<i> steamrolled the City Council into approving a term limits extension so that
</I>&gt;<i> he could run for a third term, and then made the 2009 mayoral race a
</I>&gt;<i> formality by massively outspending his opponents.  He has consolidated
</I>&gt;<i> executive power at the top of one the most arcane and entrenched municipal
</I>&gt;<i> governments in the United States.  In a way, this has been beneficial to the
</I>&gt;<i> open government and open data movements, as it forces them to make a strong
</I>&gt;<i> case and build real political support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often, the work of New York City activists takes hold in other cities
</I>&gt;<i> before it feeds back home.  Outsiders watch our story unfold, borrow our
</I>&gt;<i> tactics and message, and convince their more progressive officials to adopt
</I>&gt;<i> early.  New York officials get to watch and wait, and implement selectively
</I>&gt;<i> based on successes elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This summer, City Councilmember Gale Brewer &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://council.nyc.gov/d6/html/members/home.shtml">http://council.nyc.gov/d6/html/members/home.shtml</A>&gt;, Chair of the Committee
</I>&gt;<i> on Technology in Government, introduced legislation &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scribd.com/doc/19114971/New-York-City-Council-Int-991-Accessibility-to-Public-Records">http://www.scribd.com/doc/19114971/New-York-City-Council-Int-991-Accessibility-to-Public-Records</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> mandating an open data policy across all city agencies.  Bloomberg has
</I>&gt;<i> fought the bill partly on cost, but his team's core argument has been that
</I>&gt;<i> they take a &quot;customer-focused approach&quot; and will release data streams
</I>&gt;<i> selectively as customers demand them.  (The New York Observer's Future
</I>&gt;<i> Initiative blog has tracked the entire story here &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://nyfi.observer.com/tags/open-data">http://nyfi.observer.com/tags/open-data</A>&gt; under its &quot;open data&quot; tag.)  So,
</I>&gt;<i> even though Brewer's legislation might create an innovation ecology that far
</I>&gt;<i> surpasses anything that Bloomberg's corporate-model government could
</I>&gt;<i> produce, we have not as a movement made a sufficient case.  Meanwhile,
</I>&gt;<i> cities like San Francisco and Portland are aggressively releasing their
</I>&gt;<i> municipal data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Open Planning Project (TOPP) &lt;<A HREF="http://theopenplanningproject.org/">http://theopenplanningproject.org</A>&gt;, one
</I>&gt;<i> of the organizations mentioned in Ms. Chen's article above, has been a major
</I>&gt;<i> driver of the open data movement.  They have produced useful one-off
</I>&gt;<i> applications, such as FixCity.org &lt;<A HREF="http://fixcity.org/">http://fixcity.org/</A>&gt;, which
</I>&gt;<i> crowdsources potential locations for new bike racks thus speeding their
</I>&gt;<i> installation.  They have also acted as stewards of open standards in the
</I>&gt;<i> Geographic Information Systems (GIS) community and, more recently, the Open
</I>&gt;<i> 311 community.  Mayor Bloomberg pioneered the 311 non-emergency
</I>&gt;<i> telephone-based citizen information service, but has been slow to open up
</I>&gt;<i> the data for mashups by eager civic hackers.  Washington D.C. was the first
</I>&gt;<i> to move on this, and TOPP is now stewarding the effort at Open311.org &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://open311.org/">http://open311.org</A>&gt; to create a standard for all Open311 APIs in any city.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As part of this effort, TOPP is hosting an Open311 DevCamp at their home
</I>&gt;<i> office in New York, where officials from more than 7 cities from across the
</I>&gt;<i> Americas will gather to develop best practices.  It wasn't until late last
</I>&gt;<i> week, however, after so many other cities got on board, that NYC officials
</I>&gt;<i> bothered to acknowledge and RSVP for an innovative event in their own
</I>&gt;<i> backyard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another telling example can be found in Ms. Chen's article.  Tom Lowenhaupt
</I>&gt;<i> has been fighting for almost ten years to bring the .nyc top-level domain to
</I>&gt;<i> New York City.  His vision has been to use the revenue generated from this
</I>&gt;<i> civic resource to provide digital literacy and civic education through
</I>&gt;<i> neighborhood-oriented online community spaces.  In that time, Tom has built
</I>&gt;<i> a knowledge base (within a TOPP wiki) that has become a common reference
</I>&gt;<i> point for City TLD initiatives globally.  It contains a wide range of
</I>&gt;<i> information, including arguments for why a TLD needs to be as carefully
</I>&gt;<i> planned as city streets, and the potential civic benefits that can accrue
</I>&gt;<i> through such planning.  Tom has worked with parallel initiatives in global
</I>&gt;<i> cities such as Paris and Barcelona to develop international standards for
</I>&gt;<i> City TLDs, ensuring that non-English speakers can easily access the city's
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, city officials announced their intention to apply for the .nyc
</I>&gt;<i> TLD.  They issued an RFP, seeking vendors who are qualified to manage this
</I>&gt;<i> resource.  The key criterion for choosing the winner?  Who can produce the
</I>&gt;<i> most revenue for the city in the next five years.  There is no mention of
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate planning for the allocation of domain names, or synergies with
</I>&gt;<i> other global cities.  While other cities may benefit from Tom's grassroots
</I>&gt;<i> efforts, New York is looking to make a short term profit from a TLD
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;landrush&quot;, and will soon find themselves lagging behind more
</I>&gt;<i> forward-thinking cities that have benefitted from better digital planning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the .nyc case, there is still time for the usual pattern to unfold.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps officials will look beyond the short-term revenue potential (a
</I>&gt;<i> difficult thing to do in this economy) and learn from other cities some
</I>&gt;<i> lessons that they, ironically, learned in the first place from a determined
</I>&gt;<i> New Yorker.  There is incredible civic innovation in NYC, in some ways
</I>&gt;<i> strengthened by the resistance it faces.  But we don't always reap what we
</I>&gt;<i> sow, and when we do we are often served last.
</I>&gt;<i>
