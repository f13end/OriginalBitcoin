Education in the Creative Economy
Knowledge and Learning in the Age of Innovation

Daniel Araya &amp; Michael A. Peters


Just as the industrial age transformed the agricultural age, so the
industrial age is being transformed in its turn. We are moving into a
different world now. A world in which the raw materials are not coal and
steel produced by machines but creativity and meaning produced by the human
imagination. Beyond conventional discourse on the knowledge economy, many
scholars now suggest that creative work and a rising &#8220;creative class&#8221; are
fomenting a shift in advanced economies from mass production to cultural
innovation. In Education in the Creative Economy we will examine the
contours of the creative economy discourse and consider its implications for
systems of education. Alongside discourse on the knowledge economy, we will
suggest that creative industries form a central pillar in a rising global
cultural economy that is highly informed by information and communications
technologies (ICTs). Much as the assembly line shifted the critical factor
of production from labor to capital, computer networks are now shifting the
critical factor of production from capital to collaborative innovation.
Unlike the hierarchical logic that frames mass industrial society, the
creative economy is being shaped by social networks that criss-cross
nations, cultures and peoples. In this key text, we will explore the need
for new modes of education that can effectively tap the creativity and
collective intelligence that fuels the creative economy.

Made up of a cluster of industries at the crossroads of the arts, culture,
business and technology, the creative economy constitutes a complex and
varied field of business activity, ranging from publishing, music, visual
and performing arts, to more technology-intensive and service-oriented
industries such as film, television, new media, architecture, advertising,
and design. New modes of education are critical to supporting this
socioeconomic transformation. In addition to arguments for investing in the
knowledge economy through STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering
and math), it is equally important to invest in art, design and digital
media as key interlocutors of creativity and innovation. The capacity for
communities and peoples to work creatively with established cultural
artifacts in order to support sustained innovation is emerging as the
central feature of the creative economy. As peoples and governments begin to
ponder the consequences of this emerging economic paradigm, it is becoming
obvious that policy prescriptions that harness collaborative innovation are
now critical to long-term socio-economic prosperity. One of the major
questions that we must begin to answer is: What systems, policies and
structures are most conducive to making it possible for the largest number
of people in a society to participate in the creation and development of new
cultural forms?






Overview

Section One: Educational Policy in the Creative Economy examines the
contours of the creative economy, looking particularly at the rising
importance of creativity and innovation to a global market. Tracing current
socio-economic discourse on the creative economy, this section will examine
the underlying logic of creative innovation and consider its implications
for systems of education.

Key words: National Systems of Innovation; STEM; Art and Design; Human
Capital Development; Lifelong Learning; Digital Divide; Cosmopolitanism;
Learning as Practice; Public Education and the Public Good; Collective
Intelligence; Democratizing Education; Bottom-up Innovation;


Section Two: Technology in the Creative Economy will look closely at ICTs
and their relationship to network-driven collaboration in the creative
economy. While in the industrial age, human creativity was divided into
distinct activities (art, science and business enterprise), today technology
scaffolds so many varied disciplines that their recombination in new forms
is becoming commonplace. Technology is now so critical to such a wide range
of industries and disciplines that it is clear that conventional boundaries
are breaking down.

Key words: Globalization; Information Networks; Many-to-Many collaboration;
Social Networks; Peer-Production; Open Source Software; Open Innovation;
Open Design; Network Organizations; Social Software; Web 2.0; Prosumer
Innovation; Fragmented Production Systems; Creative Clusters;


Section Three: Culture and Curriculum in the Creative Economy will consider
the growing importance of cultural production and explore the interface
between innovation and the tools needed to advance education for a creative
age. While an economy based on mass production could effectively deliver a
single standardized curriculum, it is becoming obvious that education in the
21st century will need to explore the uniqueness of students to better tap
their indigenous talents.

Key words: Open Educational Resources; Multiliteracies; E-Learning; Virtual
Classrooms; Communities-of-Practice; Ubiquitous Learning;
Wikis/Blogs/Podcasts; Learning Communities; Educational Technology; Online
Gaming; Meaning-Making; Cultural Policy; Cultural Hybridity;
