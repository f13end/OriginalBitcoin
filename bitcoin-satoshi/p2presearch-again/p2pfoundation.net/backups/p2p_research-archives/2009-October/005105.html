<PRE>Dante, I like your style, but I have a few counterpoints to some of this.

</I>

I think these are good questions. I'd also like to add: *Why* are you
doing this work? Are you doing it for the pay?

What people are doing is important. Why they are doing what they are
doing is vital to understanding the system they see themselves as
being part of.


&gt;<i> If power structures do not need workers anymore, I imagine it is unlikely a
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the population would get paid for working for what machines
</I>&gt;<i> could make cheaper, faster, and without questioning authority.
</I>
If machines do the work that we do now, we'll  turn our attentions to
new types of work (maybe figuring out how to turn all of mass around
us into computers and digital storage). Or, a dystopian outcome is:
freed up from the need to labor for survival, we turn on each
other....

&gt;<i> Perhaps people would get paid for not revolting themselves against the
</I>&gt;<i> status quo of power structures ? &#160;Or perhaps it is cheaper to pay police and
</I>&gt;<i> army forces to control parts of the population that are not required to
</I>&gt;<i> service the dominant control/monetary system ?
</I>
At least here in the US, there is enough work for at least 40 years
just re-making the education system :-) Wait until experience some
more collapses of globalized infrastructure. There's enough work for
every human on the planet in recreating our artificially globalized
infrastructure into networks of local systems

&gt;<i> Or perhaps its even &quot;cheaper&quot; ( in terms of coercive control ) to eradicate
</I>&gt;<i> such populations that would become to create their own systems and become
</I>&gt;<i> too autonomous ?
</I>&gt;<i> If we tend towards such a situation, I find it interesting to understand how
</I>&gt;<i> to create an alternative economy where it is possible to produce for
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves, preferably by using existing technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> I already feel I am in such a situation : I do not seem to be servicing
</I>&gt;<i> direct needs of the status quo of power structures, so as a result I am not
</I>&gt;<i> paid for trying to change it.
</I>
My approach is to convince them to try something really, really
different, and get them to fund that. It's up to you how you ask to be
funded. You can ask for money, or you could ask for them to give you a
piece of land, and enough materials to build a structure on it. etc
etc

I think that &quot;spectrum&quot; could be intepreted by some people as meaning
&quot;from one extreme to another&quot;. A finite range, with linear progression
from one end to another. And so, the inevitble question becomes &quot;where
you you on this spectrum?&quot;

What if I get payed to produce things that people do not pay for?
Where do I fit on this spectrum? Where on the spectrum is the model of
convincing people who rely on enclosed resources to invest in creating
common pool resources that they participate in co-managing and using?
This is a picture of what I do.

I want to advocate that there are more possibilities than may be
apparent if you view the picture through a &quot;spectrum&quot; of
possibilities. The actual nature of the system is non-linear, and so
it is not easy to see it through a linear lens.
