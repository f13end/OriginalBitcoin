<PRE><A HREF="http://politics.slashdot.org/story/09/10/31/1547221/Lawmakers-Caught-Again-By-File-Sharing-Software">http://politics.slashdot.org/story/09/10/31/1547221/Lawmakers-Caught-Again-By-File-Sharing-Software</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
An anonymous reader writes &quot;A document, apparently a 'confidential House 
ethics committee report,' was recently leaked through file-sharing software 
to the Washington Post. According to the article, 'The committee's review of 
investigations became available on file-sharing networks because of a junior 
staff member's use of the software while working from home.' Of course, P2P 
software is entirely at fault for this incident. If you begin seeing more 
interest in DRM from Congress, you now know why.&quot;
Reader GranTuring points out that the RIAA took the opportunity to make a 
ridiculous statement of their own. They said, &quot;the disclosure was evidence 
of a need for controls on peer-to-peer software to block the improper or 
illegal exchange of music.&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/29/AR2009102904597.html?hpid=topnews">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/29/AR2009102904597.html?hpid=topnews</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Dozens in Congress under ethics inquiry
AN ACCIDENTAL DISCLOSURE
Document was found on file-sharing network
House ethics investigators have been scrutinizing the activities of more 
than 30 lawmakers and several aides in inquiries about issues including 
defense lobbying and corporate influence peddling, according to a 
confidential House ethics committee report prepared in July.
The report appears to have been inadvertently placed on a publicly 
accessible computer network, and it was provided to The Washington Post by a 
source not connected to the congressional investigations. The committee said 
Thursday night that the document was released by a low-level staffer.
The ethics committee is one of the most secretive panels in Congress, and 
its members and staff members sign oaths not to disclose any activities 
related to its past or present investigations. Watchdog groups have accused 
the committee of not actively pursuing inquiries; the newly disclosed 
document indicates the panel is conducting far more investigations than it 
had revealed.
Shortly after 6 p.m. Thursday, the committee chairman, Zoe Lofgren 
(D-Calif.), interrupted a series of House votes to alert lawmakers about the 
breach. She cautioned that some of the panel's activities are preliminary 
and not a conclusive sign of inappropriate behavior.
&quot;No inference should be made as to any member,&quot; she said.
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

<A HREF="http://copyrightsandcampaigns.blogspot.com/2009/10/house-ethics-committee-staffer-used.html">http://copyrightsandcampaigns.blogspot.com/2009/10/house-ethics-committee-staffer-used.html</A>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
The Washington Post just published a great scoop, getting its hands on a 
confidential internal memo compiled by the House Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct (aka the Ethics Committee) that summarizes ongoing 
investigations into possible wrongdoing by 30 members and several staffers. 
And how did such a highly sensitive document become public? According to a 
statement released by the committee's chairwoman and ranking member:
     &quot;Neither the Standards Committee's nor the House's information systems 
have been breached in any way. Our initial review suggests that this 
unlawful access to confidential information involved the use of peer-to-peer 
file sharing software on the personal computer of a junior staffer, who is 
no longer employed by the Committee, while working from home.&quot;
   You heard that right: a staffer on the Ethics Committee was using 
&quot;peer-to-peer file sharing software&quot; at home. Of course, I'm sure this 
highly ethical staffer was simply &quot;sharing&quot; the King James Bible, the works 
of Shakespeare, and The Odyssey...
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Note the disparagement of p2p there on all sides. :-( Email is peer-to-peer.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
  The Recording Industry Association of America said the disclosure was 
evidence of a need for controls on peer-to-peer software to block the 
improper or illegal exchange of music. Some lawmakers have tried for years 
to bring this about.
Mitch Bainwol, the group's chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;It's 
now happening (in) Congress' backyard, and that should be a powerful 
catalyst to enact real reforms to protect consumers.&quot;
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Note how RIAA, whose current business model has been to sue consumers, is 
saying they are all about &quot;protecting&quot; consumers.

To see who else they are &quot;protecting&quot;, see: :-)
   &quot;Courtney Love does the math&quot;

&quot;The controversial singer takes on record label profits, Napster and &quot;sucka 
VCs.&quot; ... Today I want to talk about piracy and music. What is piracy? 
Piracy is the act of stealing an artist's work without any intention of 
paying for it. I'm not talking about Napster-type software. I'm talking 
about major label recording contracts. ...&quot;

(I think someone else wrote something like that first about the music 
industry, the Love borrowed much of it from.)
