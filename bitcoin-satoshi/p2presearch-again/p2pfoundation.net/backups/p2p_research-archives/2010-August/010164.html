<PRE>Andy,

thanks a lot for having engaged with my questions and objections, I'm
learning a lot from your considerations and in-depth knowledge!

I notice a distinct reichian influence in your approach? reminds of the
three years I spent in a reichian intentional community ...

Michel

&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for the delay in responding, I'm busy with work at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;So I reverse the burden of proof. People who deny any human universality
</I>&gt;<i> have to proof that not a single human trait is shared&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I put the burden of proof in the right place, for several reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, the danger of positing as universal something which is not is both
</I>&gt;<i> greater (it leads to dehumanisation) and more pervasive (it is in continuity
</I>&gt;<i> with colonialism and western epistemological privilege) than any cost on the
</I>&gt;<i> other side. Secondly, this kind of claim is constantly falsifiable, and
</I>&gt;<i> hence insecure as a basis for future-oriented actions. Orienting ethically
</I>&gt;<i> towards the future is not the same as trying to deduce scientific cause and
</I>&gt;<i> effect. There is always the possibility that the next human born will
</I>&gt;<i> falsify everything that went before, and ethics has to be alert to this
</I>&gt;<i> possibility. More likely, the revelation or closer listening to formerly
</I>&gt;<i> silenced voices will falsify everything that went before (as it has
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly already).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;... are there any humans which never experience love, hate, mothers who
</I>&gt;<i> are at least challenged by their infants, etc... &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, firstly, this would be a question of whether there are languages in
</I>&gt;<i> which these categories (love, hate, mothers, challenge) do not exist. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, there are many cultures where nothing like the western concept of
</I>&gt;<i> love exists, because attachments are situated and relative; and cultures
</I>&gt;<i> where older female relatives would all be called the same name. But I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect you're actually trying to argue from a supposed universality of
</I>&gt;<i> emotions rather than the language used to describe them. In this case I
</I>&gt;<i> would say that emotional reactions make no sense without specific
</I>&gt;<i> character-structures or bioenergetic structures which are inherently variant
</I>&gt;<i> (remember also that actual neurological structure is different in autism,
</I>&gt;<i> and is altered in schizophrenia). Even if two emotional reactions are
</I>&gt;<i> conventionally called the same name, they might be fundamentally different
</I>&gt;<i> in their real structure. For instance, the &#8220;hate&#8221; a heavily
</I>&gt;<i> character-armoured reactive personality-type feels towards difference &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> which is composed of painful excitation of repressed desires and the
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding activation of superego defences to repress such excitation &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> is fundamentally different from the &#8220;hate&#8221; an active personality-type feels
</I>&gt;<i> towards external agents of control, which is connected to fight-or-flight
</I>&gt;<i> reflexes articulated experientially to certain symbols. With &#8220;love&#8221; we'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to unpack whether romantic love reinforced by distance and focused on
</I>&gt;<i> the perceived perception of the love-object is phenomenologically the same
</I>&gt;<i> as psychological dependence on another person interpellated as master, and
</I>&gt;<i> whether either of these has anything to do with affinities arising from
</I>&gt;<i> bioenergetic overlap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, the relevant question is not whether the emotion is universal
</I>&gt;<i> but whether it provides a basis for universal claims. And for this, it is
</I>&gt;<i> far more relevant *what* people love or hate than *whether* they do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there are mothers who are not challenged by their infants &#8211; those who
</I>&gt;<i> gave them up at birth :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the relevant question here is whether the mother-child relation is
</I>&gt;<i> universal. I have heard of societies with extended-family or village
</I>&gt;<i> childrearing where it is reported that crying babies are almost unknown,
</I>&gt;<i> because those appearing unhappy are passed around among relatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Of course it is possible to argue that, since &#8220;human&#8221; is a concept and
</I>&gt;<i> concepts are constructed through defining characteristics and exclusions,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore certain things are necessarily part of it &#8211; but this simply
</I>&gt;<i> displaces a Schmittian stance (arbitary attachment to a certain founding
</I>&gt;<i> decision) from the ethical choice to the choice of defining features. In
</I>&gt;<i> addition, it only applies if &#8220;human&#8221; is a concept with a conceptual core. It
</I>&gt;<i> does not apply if the concept is marked by Wittgensteinean family
</I>&gt;<i> resemblances. It also does not apply if the concept refers to similarities
</I>&gt;<i> at the level of thegenotype which are expressed in variation at the level of
</I>&gt;<i> the phenotype. The question further arises of why the &#8220;human&#8221; is the focus
</I>&gt;<i> of ethics or community here. Humans are not self-sufficient as a
</I>&gt;<i> group/species any more than as individuals, but always depend on a wider
</I>&gt;<i> actor-network composed of ecological entities. Further, supposing that
</I>&gt;<i> similarities can be adduced, it is still doubtful the extent to which they
</I>&gt;<i> can be used as grounds for unity. One could start from abstract
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics such as mortality, but these have little fix as objects of
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Or perhaps from physical needs such as food (though one would then
</I>&gt;<i> have to deal with anorexia, fasting saints, and hunger strikers...) - but
</I>&gt;<i> this does not explain why commonality would serve as a unifying force, as
</I>&gt;<i> people could just as easily fight over food. If you're positing something
</I>&gt;<i> like a need to produce meaning (as in Geertz), this similarly leads to a
</I>&gt;<i> situation where the exercise of the proposed &#8220;similarity&#8221; produces
</I>&gt;<i> difference rather than unity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- as for the social and collective field, this again would mean for me
</I>&gt;<i> that we are born and relate in a tabula rasa world, where nothing conditions
</I>&gt;<i> us, where only agents exist and no communion. Again for the these are
</I>&gt;<i> co-existing polarities in an integrative field &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're confusing two entirely unrelated questions here: the question of
</I>&gt;<i> atomism vs relationality, and the question of structure vs agency. You're
</I>&gt;<i> attributing an atomist position to me when what I've taken is an agency
</I>&gt;<i> position. I take agency and relational positions. Of course the world is not
</I>&gt;<i> tabula rasa. There are already relations in existence at any point. The
</I>&gt;<i> field of relations &#8220;conditions&#8221; people &#8211; though not in a passive way. But
</I>&gt;<i> the relations are constantly invented and reinvented through agency (and not
</I>&gt;<i> only human agency). The point I insist on is that the relations never form a
</I>&gt;<i> complete totality which composes of all their parts. The field of relations
</I>&gt;<i> as structure is an illusory effect of the repetition of forms of agency. On
</I>&gt;<i> a more spiritual level we might even say that we come entirely from the
</I>&gt;<i> previous field, we are composed entirely from elements in it. But we are
</I>&gt;<i> also &#8220;differenciated&#8221; from it as a particular combination of elements, and
</I>&gt;<i> this combination exercises agency. The only way to believe in an external
</I>&gt;<i> field or communion is via reification and fetishism, by imagining things
</I>&gt;<i> which are products of agency to actually be inert things with no history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- transcendent objects ... I concede that there may be other type of
</I>&gt;<i> socialities, but I would argue that my life's experience has shown me that
</I>&gt;<i> without a transcendent object, no human relationships can persist &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect this really means, &#8220;among the normal type of people as
</I>&gt;<i> subjectified today&#8221;, and the whole point of social change is to break down
</I>&gt;<i> the dominant forms of subjectification today. Life-experience provides an
</I>&gt;<i> inadequate data-set for testing claims of this type as it is composed mainly
</I>&gt;<i> of interactions with people subjectified into the dominant type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;what I would call human transaction cost, humans in my view, can live in
</I>&gt;<i> insecurity, but there always need to be some anchor somewhere, if all things
</I>&gt;<i> have to be negotiated all the time, the huge energy input required to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain this, would eventually dissolve the community and/or the project&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And this is exactly the problem &#8211; the in-group, the &#8220;normal&#8221;, decide to
</I>&gt;<i> exclude everyone else on the basis that they're too &#8220;costly&#8221; to include
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning that the &#8220;normal&#8221; have to put in the same effort that the different
</I>&gt;<i> have to put in all the time), the result being that they monopolise
</I>&gt;<i> everything for themselves as an in-group able to take short-cuts at the
</I>&gt;<i> expense of excluding others. But of course the existence of difference does
</I>&gt;<i> not disappear with this exclusion/repression, and neither do the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> costs. Rather, the transaction costs are concentrated at the point of
</I>&gt;<i> difference: the &#8220;normal&#8221; do not have to make the stretch to include others,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas others have to put in constant effort to engage with a world
</I>&gt;<i> rendered all the more difficult for its lack of critical literacy. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, if we take the transaction cost between &#8220;normal&#8221; and different as -50
</I>&gt;<i> on each side in a condition of equality, it becomes -99 to the different and
</I>&gt;<i> -1 to the normal in a case of outright exclusion, or, say, -80 to the
</I>&gt;<i> different and -20 to the normal in a case of relative inclusion, where the
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;normal&#8221; retain hegemony and determine the procedures but make some
</I>&gt;<i> allowances. (I'm bracketing the possibility of differential capabilities to
</I>&gt;<i> make such energy contributions because there is little reason to assume the
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;normal&#8221; have *lower* capabilities than others).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point being twofold: firstly that this is absolutely ethically
</I>&gt;<i> indefensible, and secondly that it logically entails a situation of social
</I>&gt;<i> war between the &#8220;normal&#8221; and the different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the first point: How is it possible to maintain that the cost of -50 is
</I>&gt;<i> intolerable because of the &#8220;huge energy input&#8221;, and yet that it is
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to expect an energy input of -80 or -99 from others? The &#8220;normal&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> are simply claiming the *privilege* of reduced energy input at the expense
</I>&gt;<i> of displacing it onto others (and if they resent a redistribution back to
</I>&gt;<i> -50 each way, this is simply a defence of privilege &#8211; though none the less
</I>&gt;<i> likely *predictively* to happen as a result).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the second point: If the position taken is either 1) that it is
</I>&gt;<i> actually, literally impossible for people to put in an input as high as -50,
</I>&gt;<i> or 2) that the &#8220;normal&#8221; can never be expected to give up their privilege
</I>&gt;<i> once they have it, even though this means intolerably high demands on
</I>&gt;<i> others, the net effect is irreconcilability. Because on 1) it is also
</I>&gt;<i> impossible for the different to make the demanded sacrifices, and on 2)
</I>&gt;<i> there is a collision of two equally intolerable demands. If this is the
</I>&gt;<i> situation then the best we can hope for is coexistence on the basis of
</I>&gt;<i> separation, which can only occur if ingroup resource monopolies are
</I>&gt;<i> addressed. Given that the barrier to a just settlement (either a return to
</I>&gt;<i> -50 each if possible or coexistence based on separation if it is not) is
</I>&gt;<i> dominance of the field by the &#8220;normal&#8221;, the net effect is that conflictual
</I>&gt;<i> acts by the different become justified and acts by the &#8220;normal&#8221; to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> the existing social field are unjustified. The effect, in short, is that
</I>&gt;<i> irreconcilable social antagonism is inevitable and in this antagonism,
</I>&gt;<i> justice is absolutely on the side of the different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the question of &#8220;anchors&#8221;. Again this is not a universal thing. The
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;need&#8221; for &#8220;anchors&#8221; is exacerbated by traumas, to the point that it is hard
</I>&gt;<i> to know how &#8220;basic&#8221; it is. The usual autistic response to &#8220;need for anchors&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> is intensely personal (routines, rituals etc), but this is a response to a
</I>&gt;<i> very specific &#8220;anchoring&#8221; problem (in relation to sensory overload). I've
</I>&gt;<i> nothing against people having anchors, but I don't see why they need to be
</I>&gt;<i> collectivised. The easiest way to achieve anchoring on a collective level is
</I>&gt;<i> through &#8220;othering&#8221;/scapegoating, so it is desirable to curb the impulse to
</I>&gt;<i> collectivise such desires. One could also argue that the Buddhist doctrine
</I>&gt;<i> of mindfulness and similar are responses to the problem of anchoring which
</I>&gt;<i> also maintain radical immanence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I have experienced many different communities in my life, but have never
</I>&gt;<i> seen one that did not consolidate habits after a while, these are mostly
</I>&gt;<i> negotiated unconsciously, and in your vision as I understand it, should be
</I>&gt;<i> brought into consciousness, which I applaud as a goal. &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main point is that they should be open to contestation and should be
</I>&gt;<i> suspended in cases where they are inapplicable. Which I daresay happens a
</I>&gt;<i> lot more often at the micro level (intentional communities and the like)
</I>&gt;<i> than the macro level, and a lot more easily in networks than in formal
</I>&gt;<i> structures. I have a sense that localising/downscaling of communities is
</I>&gt;<i> generally helpful towards inclusiveness, that diffusion of power within
</I>&gt;<i> communities is even more helpful, and that formal procedures tend to lock in
</I>&gt;<i> the &#8220;wrong&#8221; kinds of attitudes and mentalities, though ultimately everything
</I>&gt;<i> comes down to the attitude people have to difference and sameness on a
</I>&gt;<i> meta-ethical level. In programming communities and the like, a lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> problems are warded off through the temporary, contingent nature of whatever
</I>&gt;<i> authority exists, and by the constantly available option of branching and
</I>&gt;<i> forking: difference is articulated at different points in the network, often
</I>&gt;<i> at points where transaction cost is relatively low and potential gain
</I>&gt;<i> greatest. This is also what I see happening in diffuse activist networks:
</I>&gt;<i> people distribute themselves into different friendship networks and projects
</I>&gt;<i> and in a sense &#8220;flow around&#8221; the problems (such as personality
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibilities) which would be fatal if everyone was in a big
</I>&gt;<i> organisation. When institutionalisation happens, it is usually a response to
</I>&gt;<i> the dissipation of the creative energies fuelling a network, and corresponds
</I>&gt;<i> with the decline of the network. The biggest barrier to living entirely in
</I>&gt;<i> diffuse networks is the monopolisation of resources by large organisations
</I>&gt;<i> (corporations, states) which then distribute resources conditionally. The
</I>&gt;<i> net effect, for instance, of a basic income would be the proliferation of
</I>&gt;<i> diffuse networks, which is why the big organisations are hostile to it. It
</I>&gt;<i> is also the effect of pulls away from the centre in economics. Indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> peoples are very interesting in this regard. They have some degree of
</I>&gt;<i> habituation (what Deleuze terms &#8220;supple segmentarity&#8221;) but it is interpreted
</I>&gt;<i> very loosely and in the best cases, is constantly shaken up by practices of
</I>&gt;<i> diffusion of power and by the counterbalancing of different power-centres &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> many of the most anarchic seem to specifically avoid institutionalising
</I>&gt;<i> power.
