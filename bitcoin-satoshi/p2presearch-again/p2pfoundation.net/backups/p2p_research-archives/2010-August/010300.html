<PRE>Michel, the energy behind your threat is associated with my stated
intentions to expel you from the board.  I said in private that I want to
vote you off the board.  I don't see a problem with this intention.  This is
how democracy works.

To me, this is about democracy, and this is good.  Voting for and against a
position or for a representative is a good thing.

Maybe this is the subject we should talk about?

If this was a democracy I would vote you off.

I say I have a right to critique your use of authority and the decisions you
make.

I want users to have rights.  I want users to be represented on the board.

I see democracy as an important part of a community.

I have a right to contact others. I have a right to learn from their
concerns and to share information with them.

Alex

&gt;<i> I want to report on an issue that I had communicated privately, to honour
</I>&gt;<i> my own promise to restrain myself, but given Sam Rose's reply which I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> copying in without his permission, confirms that private bullying has gone
</I>&gt;<i> on much more systematically. I must admit I find it hard to adopt this
</I>&gt;<i> restraint, since I feel the very survival of what I have tried to build,
</I>&gt;<i> with others, is at state, and people need to know also what happens 'behind
</I>&gt;<i> the scenes'. As you will see from the development below, private
</I>&gt;<i> communication can be used as a weapon, and it's part of the equation and the
</I>&gt;<i> power play
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People who have been following this controversy know that it started from
</I>&gt;<i> increasing frustration that my concerns were not heard, and replies like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;read the f ..ing manual&quot;. A whole attitude of superiority and dismissal of
</I>&gt;<i> concern. As you'll see below, I'm literally for Alex &quot;a little man&quot;, as well
</I>&gt;<i> as an &quot;old man&quot; who has to learn to share. I may be a little and old man
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm 52), but I do not think that I need any lessons in sharing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also reported on the habit of bullying, but perhaps underestimated how
</I>&gt;<i> persuasive this was. While I have seen examples, I was unaware that similar
</I>&gt;<i> communication had been directed to other people who expressed support here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also another deeper reason for this. James, who like me has a
</I>&gt;<i> conciliatory and mediating personality (in this of course, I have not kept
</I>&gt;<i> up that habit), tells me he does not wish to take any specific measures. My
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that this means only certainly the following scenario unfolding,
</I>&gt;<i> and bear with me for the explanation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - in the coming weeks, we will collect candidacies for the new board,
</I>&gt;<i> present it to this list, and see who else wants on, and decide on a process
</I>&gt;<i> for the nomination. Almost certainly, Alex will pose his candidacy, since he
</I>&gt;<i> has openly declared that he wants in, and use his position to start a
</I>&gt;<i> campaign for my ouster. As I indicated, I feel this is inaceptable at this
</I>&gt;<i> stage of the budding life of the P2P Foundation as something more than a
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge commons. Permanent 'civil war' will almost certainly dissipate the
</I>&gt;<i> positive energies needed to continue construction of the movement. This
</I>&gt;<i> means, that were his candidacy accepted, he would have won. It also means
</I>&gt;<i> that all the changes that are meant to mold the foundation to his own image,
</I>&gt;<i> would succeed. This would mean working under a regime that I would abhor,
</I>&gt;<i> the construction of the P2P Foundation as an authorititarian cult. I accept
</I>&gt;<i> that Alex has good intentions, but I also strongly believe that there is a
</I>&gt;<i> lack of self-reflection and that he is not aware of his bullying manner, and
</I>&gt;<i> prisoner to a conviction of righteousness. To use a historical analogy, when
</I>&gt;<i> Stalin took over the power structure in Russia, he did not say, I'm an evil
</I>&gt;<i> man who wants power and send everyone to the Gulag, but draped himself in
</I>&gt;<i> righteousness, billed the others as enemies, used this righteousness as the
</I>&gt;<i> standard, and send them to the Gulag. Of course, no such thing could happen
</I>&gt;<i> in a voluntary organisation, but I want to indicate a similar process. As
</I>&gt;<i> the policy documents produced by Alex indicate, the Board would consist of
</I>&gt;<i> ultra-committed advocates, with only one thing in mind, i.e. they would be
</I>&gt;<i> righteous, they would swear allegiance to his pledge of commitment, and a
</I>&gt;<i> process would be in place to enforce a p2p orthodoxy that would go in the
</I>&gt;<i> sense of what has been described. Even if no blood would be shed, the
</I>&gt;<i> atmosphere would not be that of a congenial and convicial voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> organisation, but that more akin of a cult, driven by a righteous leader.
</I>&gt;<i> True all of this is now only visible in seed form, and most of you may not
</I>&gt;<i> see this, but it is there already if you can see it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Needless to say, I do not want to be part of such an organisation, not of
</I>&gt;<i> course, because I am against commitment, but because such a vision of p2p-f
</I>&gt;<i> sees it not as a movement based on come and go voluntary contrbutions, but
</I>&gt;<i> as something altogether different. I have indicated before that Alex'
</I>&gt;<i> vision, however legimate as one choice within the p2p sphere, is entirely
</I>&gt;<i> monological, since he things he can positively describe singular p2p
</I>&gt;<i> principles and hold people accountable to them. My problem is NOT with that
</I>&gt;<i> vision, but with the effort to impose that singular vision on the whole of
</I>&gt;<i> the p2p-f and to make the work of us that disagree, subservient to that
</I>&gt;<i> monological vision. If Alex has a vision of text as code, however legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> as a hypothesis and belief, then he simply enacts it, refuses to  take into
</I>&gt;<i> account any objections, and implicitely forces all of us to go along. If
</I>&gt;<i> Alex has a vision of the P2P-F as an idealized cult of p2p monks, he writes
</I>&gt;<i> up policy documents that if accepted, would be the basis to attack those
</I>&gt;<i> that diverge from that idealized vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, if nothing happens, Alex comes on the Board and I refuse to
</I>&gt;<i> enter it under those conditions, this is far from being only a personal
</I>&gt;<i> matter only. I will have to create another vehicle for my work, and make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that next time, there are minimum protective measures that can counter
</I>&gt;<i> any strategy of the coucou, as we have just witnessed. The rest of you,
</I>&gt;<i> those that do no wish to act against the imposition of a singular vision,
</I>&gt;<i> will ultimately also live with the consequences. I expect that most of you
</I>&gt;<i> would leave once they see the real consequences of the change, but others
</I>&gt;<i> may come, who like the direction of a stern father figure telling them of
</I>&gt;<i> the one way to salvation. In the process though, four years of work will
</I>&gt;<i> have been hijacked, and morphed into something that goes against the orginal
</I>&gt;<i> spirit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From your experience here, through the wiki, blog and mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, you must already be aware of the counter-vision that I have
</I>&gt;<i> proposed and enacted, with faults and warts but nevertheless as a sincere
</I>&gt;<i> attempt,  that of the foundation as a pluralistic platform, with mutual
</I>&gt;<i> respect, and where different visions can co-exist. Such co-existence can
</I>&gt;<i> also include that of Alex, if he retracts his promise for a permanent civil
</I>&gt;<i> war, and if he would learn to take his place as a peer instead of imposing
</I>&gt;<i> his singular vision of everybody else. I have personally lost any confidence
</I>&gt;<i> and trust that Alex would be capable of this, but would still accept it in
</I>&gt;<i> the name of due process and giving everybody extra chances. But I won't be
</I>&gt;<i> happy to work in a context where I have to fight constantly, be bullied. Why
</I>&gt;<i> would I, since for me as well this is a voluntary engagement, and the new
</I>&gt;<i> lord does not pay me to undergo this particular treatment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK then, exhibit one:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;it is a user regime.  it always will be, no matter how confused little men
</I>&gt;<i> like you are.  you old people will have to learn to share, especially since
</I>&gt;<i> you need the techs in order to do anything.
</I>&gt;<i> [8/12/2010 7:15:28 PM]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Alex does not see the contradiction of advocating a user regime, while
</I>&gt;<i> wanting to sit in the board and demote me as a user ... the new regime will
</I>&gt;<i> not be a user regime, but a board-driven authoritarian organisation, where
</I>&gt;<i> petty rules (the literarlly hundreds of pages are being produced as we
</I>&gt;<i> speak) will drive process; what alex has in mind is not just the formal
</I>&gt;<i> rules of the wikipedia but also it's power structure of powerful admins,
</I>&gt;<i> that have successfully halted the growth of it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exhibit two, a for now anonymous confirmation of my intuition:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - You were more than justified. Alex went well into the realm of
</I>&gt;<i> personal attacks, harassment and bullying towards you in these
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges. I think the only way you were going to see it stop was to
</I>&gt;<i> hold up a mirror for him, so that he could see how he was acting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is just a waste of time at this point. I see this as
</I>&gt;<i> bullying, because he's putting pressure on you in an abusive way to
</I>&gt;<i> try and trip you up, then use this against you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When someone starts doing stuff like this, there's no need to extend
</I>&gt;<i> the regular respect and patience that you might extend to most others.
</I>&gt;<i> They don't deserve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really hope that other people will hear this, and take steps to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> metamorphosis of this project.
</I>&gt;<i>
