<PRE>Smari shared some interesting insights with me the other day, a sort
of treatise on empire as a mathematical construct.  Here is an example
of a partial extension.

No matter what else is happening, the deepest and widest commons is
always the most inclusive.  It rejects nothing.  At all.  It also has
no externalities from this perspective.

Every system can attempt to approach this, and the closer a system
gets the more alike it is to others that reach for the same goal.
Many systems lose all structural historical identification with their
origin through the process of ever widening embrace.

P2P is very much like a set of cellular automata that is present all
the way up the value chain.  P2P is not necessarily ambiguous or
ideological, and some would say that a non-ideological P2P, or a more
ambiguous and more inclusive P2P is no P2P at all.

Jaap would do well to read some Ken Wilber as his description is very
close to the complexity systems proposed there, and that work informs
my own work in complexity, too.  I don't say Wilber's work is
definitive.  I do say that the issue is to match based on complexity
of operations, and that little else is of sufficient import to require
technical implementation or even documentation.

</I>&gt;<i> allow an owner to derive asymmetric gain?
</I>&gt;<i> If you can answer this, then what is the reason for adding an

</I>&gt;<i> The short &quot;solution&quot; (is it incomplete?) might be:
</I>&gt;<i> Owners and workers operate as common equal-share equal-authority
</I>&gt;<i> governors under owner protocol.&#160;&#160; An owner wishing to derive
</I>&gt;<i> asymmetric gain is subject to owner protocol.&#160; Additionally, workers
</I>&gt;<i> who wish to engage in the trade of asset-backed value units may do so
</I>&gt;<i> subject to owner protocol in as much as they wish to derive gain or
</I>&gt;<i> asymmetric gain from the common resource in order to trade the
</I>&gt;<i> asset-backed value units for other, different, asset-backed value

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am under the impression that many folks would agree that it would be

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this was the case, this would be a window into a situation where

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;From this point on, things get more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;From talking with Patrick on another thread recently, we found a line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of inquiry where we were looking at what the reasons were for worker's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and owner/users(hereafter owners) to set themselves up as separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stakeholder groups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The obvious answer is not so obvious. &#160;It's a complex diagram already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with at least 3 perspectives - owners, workers, and a commons of some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort that contains productive resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you add multiple currency commons on top of this, it gets more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complicated yet. &#160;For example, sovereign currency and &quot;asset backed&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currency like &quot;milk units&quot; or something.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One rationale for workers and owners to have separate groups is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They want different things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Workers want ... more milk, and owners want less.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Workers want one currency type and owners want another different type.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The recent discussion about protocol and networks that was blogged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about brought up some of the reasons why, for me, P2P is a great set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of tools and understandings for picking apart this set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationships.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, the &quot;solution,&quot; if there is such a thing, might include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite a bit of diligence and definition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Nobody can 'earn' Profit!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Profit only occurs when Consumers lack ownership.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Consider this scenario:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Let's say I'm good at jack-hammering, but am sick
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and tired of my boss being paid more than it really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; costs him to supply the tools and to pay my wage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; After many years of saving I finally have enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; buy my own jack-hammer. &#160;So I quit my job as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wage-slave and advertise my services as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; entrepreneur.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Soon I have many clients and things are going quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; One day a wealthy so-and-so suddenly decides he is going to open a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; tool-rental business with a strange goal:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The terms of operation for this business is to &quot;Break even, but do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; charge enough to Profit.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So now everyone in the area is able to rent jack-hammers and pay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; exactly the same amount it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; costs me in oil, repairs, extra parts, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Now whenever someone needs such work done, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can only charge the real Costs plus Wages - where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Wages are determined on the &quot;open market&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This, by definition, means I will no longer be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; collect Profit because competition in that field is now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; under perfect competition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In other words, competition reduces Profit and perfect competition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; *eliminates* profit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The reason for this is that before the tools were available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to the Consumers &quot;at cost&quot;, I was able to keep other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; workers from competing against me because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; barrier-to-entry was the initial expense of the Means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of Production (the jack-hammer).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This shows that Profit has nothing to do with Work, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is only a result of Consumers lacking at-cost access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to the Sources of Production - and where the *ultimate*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; guarantee of at-cost access is through real ownership.
