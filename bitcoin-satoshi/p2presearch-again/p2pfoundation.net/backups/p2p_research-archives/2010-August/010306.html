<PRE>I don't know what came over me but I can see it was a mistake to get  
in a fight here.  I apologize for my part in it.

&gt;<i> Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is a voluntary organisation around a shared goal and both the  
</I>&gt;<i> peer governance of the community and the democracy of the formal  
</I>&gt;<i> foundation have certainly their place; at the same time, autocracy  
</I>&gt;<i> has no place, and everybody has a right to build influence and trust  
</I>&gt;<i> through proven contributions. This is what I have tried to do  
</I>&gt;<i> myself, and as we can see from the last few weeks, I have no  
</I>&gt;<i> independent power to stop you, and have not taken any administrive  
</I>&gt;<i> measures to stop you, because I can't (first I didn't want though  
</I>&gt;<i> now I think we do need some protections against hostile takeovers)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you certainly have the right to communicate and to share your vision  
</I>&gt;<i> with others
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it is also a special project of which I'm the founder, and we're at  
</I>&gt;<i> a delicate stage of moving towards a more collective project,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there are two visions at stake, as I see it,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a pluralist vision where multiple views are possible honouring each  
</I>&gt;<i> other through mutuality, and where code is subordinated to the  
</I>&gt;<i> creation of knowledge; and where procedures are secondary to prior  
</I>&gt;<i> effort at consensus and conflit resolution through dialogue and  
</I>&gt;<i> accepted community arbitrage
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and the way I see it, a vision which claims to know what p2p is,  
</I>&gt;<i> wants to create tools to enact it in practice, and a very activist  
</I>&gt;<i> board that aims to steer this effort and does not leave room for  
</I>&gt;<i> other views, which it seeks to displace and dominate; certainly that  
</I>&gt;<i> is the way I see my experience in the last few weeks and months
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, in your practice, in the past few months, I see the  
</I>&gt;<i> following, you enacted code and were insensitive to any challenges  
</I>&gt;<i> to your vision of it,  you created policy documents given the  
</I>&gt;<i> impression of officialdom without acknowledging their private  
</I>&gt;<i> proposal status, and you have a habit of bullying  and insulting the  
</I>&gt;<i> people who disagree with you, in the private emails that accommpany  
</I>&gt;<i> the public debate .. you fight to win and dominate and behaved like  
</I>&gt;<i> an autocrat
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> none of the problems would have arisen if you had been more modest  
</I>&gt;<i> about your actions, acknowledged differences graciously, and  
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledged me as a peer with some influence because of the prior  
</I>&gt;<i> work I have done here. I have four years of practice to prove that I  
</I>&gt;<i> have never imposed my views
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> instead, you sought dominance and power, create code and policy  
</I>&gt;<i> which aims to dislodge plurality, and openly declare that you are in  
</I>&gt;<i> the game to oust me
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in theory, yes, this is legitimate, but given the strategy of the  
</I>&gt;<i> coucou you have been following, I cannot accept, not the challenge,  
</I>&gt;<i> but the fact that it would consume a large amount of destructive  
</I>&gt;<i> energies, and that there is someone on board who does not respect  
</I>&gt;<i> the plural vision, the mutuality required by cooperation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm assuming that seeking dominance for you is second nature, and I  
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure that you are even aware that you do it, neverthless,  
</I>&gt;<i> imposing and dominating is what you attempt to do, and you use  
</I>&gt;<i> process and democracy to hide behind it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since you cannot accept the slightest challenge to your all-knowing  
</I>&gt;<i> certainty about the direction of the p2p foundation, and in my view  
</I>&gt;<i> see it as a direct attack on the ego, what your call for democracy  
</I>&gt;<i> in reality means  is a promise for endless scheming and opposing my  
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and vision ..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not that they cannot be challenged, but there must be a  
</I>&gt;<i> certain amount of acceptance of the road ahead as well, in order to  
</I>&gt;<i> have some form of commonality amongst our diversity,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so, peer governance will evolve, and you've seen it in action, we  
</I>&gt;<i> talk amongst ourselves about the best way forward and how to deal  
</I>&gt;<i> with the conflict, no one has been barking orders and it has been  
</I>&gt;<i> through the presentation of the evidence of your actions in the past  
</I>&gt;<i> few weeks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and we will also have a new board, discuss about the process to  
</I>&gt;<i> nominate its members, and install democratic procedures
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but, I cannot accept someone who vows to destroy my work, has indeed  
</I>&gt;<i> made it very hard in the last few weeks to progress on, and vows to  
</I>&gt;<i> continue until he wins,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you're win-loose propositions and mentality are in my view not the  
</I>&gt;<i> proper way to engage with the P2P Foundation, and I reserve the  
</I>&gt;<i> right to make this known, and to oppose it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here's a contribution below that expresses better than myself, what  
</I>&gt;<i> I think happened, and why you are so fond of democracy and  
</I>&gt;<i> procedure, and are writing an endless stream of policy pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm  normally opposed to psychologizing differences, since  
</I>&gt;<i> they can be used to prove superiority, yet since it is my conviction  
</I>&gt;<i> that it is central for what happened between us, I will share it,  
</I>&gt;<i> and to explain my opposition to your use of democracy as  means to  
</I>&gt;<i> dominate and take over the P2P Foundation. Not that I believe you  
</I>&gt;<i> will succeed, but because I believe you will create further damage  
</I>&gt;<i> in the process, and I'm loathe to resume productive work, without  
</I>&gt;<i> being drained by an endless conflict.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I'm asking you to retract your democratic threat to do  
</I>&gt;<i> all in your power to take over this community and to fight me until  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm reduced to total powerlessness as a user. I already have been in  
</I>&gt;<i> the position of user vis a vis your imposed new rules and  
</I>&gt;<i> information architecture, I know how much you have respected my  
</I>&gt;<i> rights to disagree, and I can no longer accept this, and don't want  
</I>&gt;<i> such a regime to dominate all the good work we have done so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have my own flaws, you have your opinion on it which you  
</I>&gt;<i> generously shared and  I'm sure others can say more, but, I'm pretty  
</I>&gt;<i> sure that there is no inkling of a desire for autocracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so, here is the anonymous quote, that sets behaviour into context:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (send privately)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alex, believe me, you'd be so much happier if you stopped trying to  
</I>&gt;<i> be the boss and to push other people down, you have great skills and  
</I>&gt;<i> abilities, you would naturally rise through your contributions, and  
</I>&gt;<i> were, if you had not sought and thought that you needed to push  
</I>&gt;<i> others away in order to achieve your goals ... there was place for  
</I>&gt;<i> everybody here

</I>&gt;<i> honour my own promise to restrain myself, but given Sam Rose's reply  
</I>&gt;<i> which I'm not copying in without his permission, confirms that  
</I>&gt;<i> private bullying has gone on much more systematically. I must admit  
</I>&gt;<i> I find it hard to adopt this restraint, since I feel the very  
</I>&gt;<i> survival of what I have tried to build, with others, is at state,  
</I>&gt;<i> and people need to know also what happens 'behind the scenes'. As  
</I>&gt;<i> you will see from the development below, private communication can  
</I>&gt;<i> be used as a weapon, and it's part of the equation and the power play
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People who have been following this controversy know that it started  
</I>&gt;<i> from increasing frustration that my concerns were not heard, and  
</I>&gt;<i> replies like &quot;read the f ..ing manual&quot;. A whole attitude of  
</I>&gt;<i> superiority and dismissal of concern. As you'll see below, I'm  
</I>&gt;<i> literally for Alex &quot;a little man&quot;, as well as an &quot;old man&quot; who has  
</I>&gt;<i> to learn to share. I may be a little and old man (I'm 52), but I do  
</I>&gt;<i> not think that I need any lessons in sharing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also reported on the habit of bullying, but perhaps underestimated  
</I>&gt;<i> how persuasive this was. While I have seen examples, I was unaware  
</I>&gt;<i> that similar communication had been directed to other people who  
</I>&gt;<i> expressed support here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also another deeper reason for this. James, who like me has a  
</I>&gt;<i> conciliatory and mediating personality (in this of course, I have  
</I>&gt;<i> not kept up that habit), tells me he does not wish to take any  
</I>&gt;<i> specific measures. My problem is that this means only certainly the  
</I>&gt;<i> following scenario unfolding, and bear with me for the explanation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - in the coming weeks, we will collect candidacies for the new  
</I>&gt;<i> board, present it to this list, and see who else wants on, and  
</I>&gt;<i> decide on a process for the nomination. Almost certainly, Alex will  
</I>&gt;<i> pose his candidacy, since he has openly declared that he wants in,  
</I>&gt;<i> and use his position to start a campaign for my ouster. As I  
</I>&gt;<i> indicated, I feel this is inaceptable at this stage of the budding  
</I>&gt;<i> life of the P2P Foundation as something more than a knowledge  
</I>&gt;<i> commons. Permanent 'civil war' will almost certainly dissipate the  
</I>&gt;<i> positive energies needed to continue construction of the movement.  
</I>&gt;<i> This means, that were his candidacy accepted, he would have won. It  
</I>&gt;<i> also means that all the changes that are meant to mold the  
</I>&gt;<i> foundation to his own image, would succeed. This would mean working  
</I>&gt;<i> under a regime that I would abhor, the construction of the P2P  
</I>&gt;<i> Foundation as an authorititarian cult. I accept that Alex has good  
</I>&gt;<i> intentions, but I also strongly believe that there is a lack of self- 
</I>&gt;<i> reflection and that he is not aware of his bullying manner, and  
</I>&gt;<i> prisoner to a conviction of righteousness. To use a historical  
</I>&gt;<i> analogy, when Stalin took over the power structure in Russia, he did  
</I>&gt;<i> not say, I'm an evil man who wants power and send everyone to the  
</I>&gt;<i> Gulag, but draped himself in righteousness, billed the others as  
</I>&gt;<i> enemies, used this righteousness as the standard, and send them to  
</I>&gt;<i> the Gulag. Of course, no such thing could happen in a voluntary  
</I>&gt;<i> organisation, but I want to indicate a similar process. As the  
</I>&gt;<i> policy documents produced by Alex indicate, the Board would consist  
</I>&gt;<i> of ultra-committed advocates, with only one thing in mind, i.e. they  
</I>&gt;<i> would be righteous, they would swear allegiance to his pledge of  
</I>&gt;<i> commitment, and a process would be in place to enforce a p2p  
</I>&gt;<i> orthodoxy that would go in the sense of what has been described.  
</I>&gt;<i> Even if no blood would be shed, the atmosphere would not be that of  
</I>&gt;<i> a congenial and convicial voluntary organisation, but that more akin  
</I>&gt;<i> of a cult, driven by a righteous leader. True all of this is now  
</I>&gt;<i> only visible in seed form, and most of you may not see this, but it  
</I>&gt;<i> is there already if you can see it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Needless to say, I do not want to be part of such an organisation,  
</I>&gt;<i> not of course, because I am against commitment, but because such a  
</I>&gt;<i> vision of p2p-f sees it not as a movement based on come and go  
</I>&gt;<i> voluntary contrbutions, but as something altogether different. I  
</I>&gt;<i> have indicated before that Alex' vision, however legimate as one  
</I>&gt;<i> choice within the p2p sphere, is entirely monological, since he  
</I>&gt;<i> things he can positively describe singular p2p principles and hold  
</I>&gt;<i> people accountable to them. My problem is NOT with that vision, but  
</I>&gt;<i> with the effort to impose that singular vision on the whole of the  
</I>&gt;<i> p2p-f and to make the work of us that disagree, subservient to that  
</I>&gt;<i> monological vision. If Alex has a vision of text as code, however  
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate as a hypothesis and belief, then he simply enacts it,  
</I>&gt;<i> refuses to  take into account any objections, and implicitely forces  
</I>&gt;<i> all of us to go along. If Alex has a vision of the P2P-F as an  
</I>&gt;<i> idealized cult of p2p monks, he writes up policy documents that if  
</I>&gt;<i> accepted, would be the basis to attack those that diverge from that  
</I>&gt;<i> idealized vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, if nothing happens, Alex comes on the Board and I  
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to enter it under those conditions, this is far from being  
</I>&gt;<i> only a personal matter only. I will have to create another vehicle  
</I>&gt;<i> for my work, and make sure that next time, there are minimum  
</I>&gt;<i> protective measures that can counter any strategy of the coucou, as  
</I>&gt;<i> we have just witnessed. The rest of you, those that do no wish to  
</I>&gt;<i> act against the imposition of a singular vision, will ultimately  
</I>&gt;<i> also live with the consequences. I expect that most of you would  
</I>&gt;<i> leave once they see the real consequences of the change, but others  
</I>&gt;<i> may come, who like the direction of a stern father figure telling  
</I>&gt;<i> them of the one way to salvation. In the process though, four years  
</I>&gt;<i> of work will have been hijacked, and morphed into something that  
</I>&gt;<i> goes against the orginal spirit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From your experience here, through the wiki, blog and mailing list  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, you must already be aware of the counter-vision that I  
</I>&gt;<i> have proposed and enacted, with faults and warts but nevertheless as  
</I>&gt;<i> a sincere attempt,  that of the foundation as a pluralistic  
</I>&gt;<i> platform, with mutual respect, and where different visions can co- 
</I>&gt;<i> exist. Such co-existence can also include that of Alex, if he  
</I>&gt;<i> retracts his promise for a permanent civil war, and if he would  
</I>&gt;<i> learn to take his place as a peer instead of imposing his singular  
</I>&gt;<i> vision of everybody else. I have personally lost any confidence and  
</I>&gt;<i> trust that Alex would be capable of this, but would still accept it  
</I>&gt;<i> in the name of due process and giving everybody extra chances. But I  
</I>&gt;<i> won't be happy to work in a context where I have to fight  
</I>&gt;<i> constantly, be bullied. Why would I, since for me as well this is a  
</I>&gt;<i> voluntary engagement, and the new lord does not pay me to undergo  
</I>&gt;<i> this particular treatment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK then, exhibit one:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;it is a user regime.  it always will be, no matter how confused  
</I>&gt;<i> little men like you are.  you old people will have to learn to  
</I>&gt;<i> share, especially since you need the techs in order to do anything.
</I>&gt;<i> [8/12/2010 7:15:28 PM]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Alex does not see the contradiction of advocating a user regime,  
</I>&gt;<i> while wanting to sit in the board and demote me as a user ... the  
</I>&gt;<i> new regime will not be a user regime, but a board-driven  
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian organisation, where petty rules (the literarlly  
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of pages are being produced as we speak) will drive  
</I>&gt;<i> process; what alex has in mind is not just the formal rules of the  
</I>&gt;<i> wikipedia but also it's power structure of powerful admins, that  
</I>&gt;<i> have successfully halted the growth of it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exhibit two, a for now anonymous confirmation of my intuition:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - You were more than justified. Alex went well into the realm of
</I>&gt;<i> personal attacks, harassment and bullying towards you in these
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges. I think the only way you were going to see it stop was to
</I>&gt;<i> hold up a mirror for him, so that he could see how he was acting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is just a waste of time at this point. I see this as
</I>&gt;<i> bullying, because he's putting pressure on you in an abusive way to
</I>&gt;<i> try and trip you up, then use this against you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When someone starts doing stuff like this, there's no need to extend
</I>&gt;<i> the regular respect and patience that you might extend to most others.
</I>&gt;<i> They don't deserve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really hope that other people will hear this, and take steps to  
</I>&gt;<i> avoid the metamorphosis of this project.
</I>&gt;<i>
