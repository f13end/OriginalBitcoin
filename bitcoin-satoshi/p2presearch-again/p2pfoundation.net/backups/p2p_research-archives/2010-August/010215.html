<PRE>Michel, you have my full trust of course, and I believe that you possess 
the vision and devotion necessary to fulfill the promises of this 
network. I consider the task of managing people the toughest job of all, 
not to mention a community that is growing this quickly. So I greatly 
laud your efforts, and no one should take anything away from you in this 
respect.

I believe there must be a genuine misunderstanding here. Being the 
non-techie I am, I must admit my inability to fully grasp what is 
happening here. But may I suggest that further discourse on this will 
only seek to pursue a peaceful solution, one that will be accepted by 
all parties?

As Thomas Carlyle once said, every noble work is at first impossible. So 
while things may seem difficult now, I believe it also presents an 
opportunity for us to look at things differently, and grow in our depth 
of understanding what may/may not work in our community. Let us all 
pursue a resolution with the goal of growing this productive community.

&gt;<i> Dear friends,
</I>&gt;<i> Though my critique of Alex has been harsh, I have explained why I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought that was necessary, I have always made the disctinction 
</I>&gt;<i> between his contributions, and the fact that I was opposed to him 
</I>&gt;<i> imposing new technological directions for our wiki without process and 
</I>&gt;<i> taking into account the opinion of its main contributor.
</I>&gt;<i> Alex of course retorts that all his propositions are viewable (some of 
</I>&gt;<i> them indeed are, many changes are not), but they are of such a volume 
</I>&gt;<i> that it is not possible to process by the communty, nor by myself. The 
</I>&gt;<i> result is a rapid escalation of changes, most of them beneficial, but 
</I>&gt;<i> some of them greatly complicating the editorial work, which I oppose. 
</I>&gt;<i> I never said this before, but I'd like to reveal now that from the 
</I>&gt;<i> very first day, Alex actually stated that he did not intend to ask for 
</I>&gt;<i> my permission or opinion on any matter, which is actually fine, as 
</I>&gt;<i> long as I have the same freedom, which I have not if technological 
</I>&gt;<i> changes are imposed.
</I>&gt;<i> Because of my double evaluation, which recognizes alex's key 
</I>&gt;<i> contributions and importance, I even yesterday proposed to James Burke 
</I>&gt;<i> in a Skype conversation to reserve a place for Alex in the new board, 
</I>&gt;<i> pending our decision on which process we would use to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> choices. Because we do not have a membership, the idea was to propose 
</I>&gt;<i> a list of names, publish it on the list, and wait for reactions, in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to reach a consensus. Since we are seriously considering 
</I>&gt;<i> building a membership organisation, at some point in the next few 
</I>&gt;<i> years, probably this will happen through elections.
</I>&gt;<i> This for the context, why the urgency.
</I>&gt;<i> Alex has sent me a private letter, which I'm not suppose to divulge, 
</I>&gt;<i> and I will not, but it also contains a threat.
</I>&gt;<i> Namely the following: &quot;*You can bet I will vote you off the board as 
</I>&gt;<i> soon as I get a chance, but in the mean time you would do very well to 
</I>&gt;<i> keep this kind of thing under wraps*.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Cleary Alex is not happy with the public discussion, hence the threat 
</I>&gt;<i> of: *&quot;be quiet or else&quot;* and at the same time, I'm unwilling to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> it under wraps, he knows that, we knew that, so the next step is 
</I>&gt;<i> already declared. This is valuable information.
</I>&gt;<i> But I do think that his threat and position as a overt enemy in the 
</I>&gt;<i> organisation I have created with James, is not acceptable. I talked 
</I>&gt;<i> about a hostile IPO before, and perhaps nobody else saw this or felt 
</I>&gt;<i> this in quite the same way as I did, and of course, the primary issue 
</I>&gt;<i> was the imposition of a new policy and direction that I did not 
</I>&gt;<i> approve of.
</I>&gt;<i> This is different, and a step in the escalation in which Alex declares 
</I>&gt;<i> himself an enemy.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think this is acceptable. Therefore, it is a matter of 
</I>&gt;<i> principle for me that Alex Rollin will NOT sit on the board, and I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> reinforced not only in the belief that there should be a fork, but now 
</I>&gt;<i> that this fork should be OUTSIDE of the P2P Foundation.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing your perspectives.
</I>&gt;<i> My position is clear: it is not workable to have a declared enemy, 
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to the very organisation I have founded and tried to create.
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, the P2P Foundation is pluralist, and strives for peer 
</I>&gt;<i> governance and democracy, but I do believe there is a justifiable 
</I>&gt;<i> boundary when sometimes declares an open civil war.
</I>&gt;<i> Building the P2P Foundation is both a personal project and a 
</I>&gt;<i> collective project, where hopefully the collective can transcend the 
</I>&gt;<i> personal at some point, and obviously, I have my own limits. 
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, I believe my personal contribution has been necessary 
</I>&gt;<i> and important, and that the continued growth of our work should be 
</I>&gt;<i> based on trust. We are not yet at a stage where factions vie for 
</I>&gt;<i> dominance, and perhaps never should.
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm now asking is indeed trust. I have made an evaluation of Alex 
</I>&gt;<i> Rollin, I have tried first to privately convey my unhappiness at 
</I>&gt;<i> imposed policy stages, then made the issue public in face of any 
</I>&gt;<i> progress, but making a careful difference between the attempt to 
</I>&gt;<i> moderate the technological changes, and Alex' otherwise positive 
</I>&gt;<i> contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> Alex however, is playing a different game, and clearly states his 
</I>&gt;<i> intention to expel me and to see support for this. It seems to me that 
</I>&gt;<i> this is a time of choosing, and I hope my friends and P2P Foundation 
</I>&gt;<i> supporters will support my continued efforts, and that since Alex 
</I>&gt;<i> finds my presence unacceptable, should found his own, using freely of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, all the material that has been collected so far, which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> commons for all to use.
