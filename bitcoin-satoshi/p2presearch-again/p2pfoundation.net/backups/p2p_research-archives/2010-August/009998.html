</I>&gt;<i> ] Summary&quot;The book is divided into three main parts. In Part I, the focus
</I>&gt;<i> is on property, principally the descriptive and normative questions of
</I>&gt;<i> property appropriation. The conventional view of property appropriation is
</I>&gt;<i> clouded by a basic myth which needs to be cleared away before the questions
</I>&gt;<i> can even be adequately posed. Then the functioning of the property system&#8211;in
</I>&gt;<i> the presence of the employment contract&#8211;can be analyzed. The normative
</I>&gt;<i> perspective is provided by the old &quot;labor theory of property&quot; which is
</I>&gt;<i> simply the usual juridical norm of imputation applied to the matter of
</I>&gt;<i> property appropriation. The history of the labor theory of property has
</I>&gt;<i> always been obscured by the confusion with the labor theory of value, a
</I>&gt;<i> confusion sponsored for different reasons by both Marxian economists and
</I>&gt;<i> neo-classical economists. That intellectual history is analyzed and a number
</I>&gt;<i> of standard misinterpretations of the labor theory of property are
</I>&gt;<i> discussed.
</I>&gt;<i> In Part II, the focus is on contract, principally the employer-employee
</I>&gt;<i> contract and its individual and collective predecessors, the voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> self-sale contract and the Hobbesian pactum subjectionis. Here we find the
</I>&gt;<i> analysis of intellectual history to be most revealing. Liberal capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> presents the most basic social question as being &quot;consent or coercion.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Slavery and autocracy lie on the side of coercion while capitalism and
</I>&gt;<i> democracy are grouped together on the side of consent. But we find a
</I>&gt;<i> different story. We find that the most sophisticated defenses of slavery and
</I>&gt;<i> autocracy were in fact liberal and based those institutions on implicit or
</I>&gt;<i> explicit voluntary slavery contracts or political pacts of subjugation.
</I>&gt;<i> The definitive answer to the liberal defenses of slavery and non-democratic
</I>&gt;<i> government came not from general liberal appeals to consent or from
</I>&gt;<i> procedural fussing about the reality of the &quot;implicit contracts&quot; but from
</I>&gt;<i> the doctrine of inalienable rights that descends from the Enlightenment. The
</I>&gt;<i> real point of debate turns out not to be &quot;consent or coercion&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;alienable or inalienable basic rights.&quot; As noted above, neo-classical
</I>&gt;<i> economic theory and liberal capitalist ideology contain no coherent and
</I>&gt;<i> uncontrived notion of inalienability that would rule out vote-selling, the
</I>&gt;<i> self-sale contract, or the Hobbesian pactum subjectionis. Yet these
</I>&gt;<i> prohibitions are fundamental to the modern western democracies. Thus we find
</I>&gt;<i> the usual correlation of capitalism with democracy to be superficial. On the
</I>&gt;<i> real question of alienable or inalienable natural rights, capitalism lies on
</I>&gt;<i> one side of the fence and democracy on the other.
</I>&gt;<i> We resurrect the Enlightenment doctrine of inalienable rights (called the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;de facto theory of inalienable rights&quot;) and present it in modern terms.
</I>&gt;<i> That old doctrine of inalienable rights has considerable &quot;bite&quot; left in it.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, it supplies a critique of the contract for renting human beings, a
</I>&gt;<i> contract which could also be viewed as the limited Hobbesian pactum
</I>&gt;<i> subjectionis for the workplace, namely the employer-employee contract. The
</I>&gt;<i> theory concludes that the employment contract is invalid &quot;in the light of
</I>&gt;<i> natural law&quot; (to use the older language).
</I>&gt;<i> Parts I and II of the book are written for &quot;intelligent general reader.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Part III applies the results of Parts I and II, namely the labor theory of
</I>&gt;<i> property and the de facto theory of inalienable rights, to economics. Here
</I>&gt;<i> it is assumed that the reader has an acquaintance with upper level
</I>&gt;<i> undergraduate economics.
</I>&gt;<i> The initial focus in Part III is on descriptive theoretical flaws in
</I>&gt;<i> capital theory and in general equilibrium theory (the Arrow-Debreu model)
</I>&gt;<i> that purports to prove the possibility of a competitive equilibrium with
</I>&gt;<i> positive pure profits. Then the focus turns to marginal productivity (MP)
</I>&gt;<i> theory which plays the role of both a descriptive and a normative theory in
</I>&gt;<i> neo-classical economics. A single corn-and-labor model is developed so that
</I>&gt;<i> marginal productivity theory, the Marxian labor theory of value and
</I>&gt;<i> exploitation, and the labor theory of property can all be compared and
</I>&gt;<i> contrasted in the same model.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, the basics of a modern theory of property and contract are
</I>&gt;<i> sketched. The theory has both a descriptive and a normative side.
</I>&gt;<i> Neo-classical economics has a &quot;fundamental theorem&quot; which relates the
</I>&gt;<i> notions of competitive equilibrium and allocative efficiency. We develop the
</I>&gt;<i> similar notions for property theory and sketch the fundamental theorem of
</I>&gt;<i> property theory.
</I>&gt;<i> The ideas and theories resurrected and developed in this book are in sharp
</I>&gt;<i> structural and paradigmatic conflict with the conventional wisdom in
</I>&gt;<i> economics and legal theory. The arguments presented here are developed in
</I>&gt;<i> the form of a running debate with this conventional wisdom&#8211;a debate that is
</I>&gt;<i> summarized at the end of most chapters. The debate is difficult at times to
</I>&gt;<i> follow since the conventional wisdom does not even pose the right questions.
</I>&gt;<i> Pouring better wine into the wrong bottles will not suffice. New bottles are
</I>&gt;<i> developed&#8211;or rather, much older bottles are rediscovered and refurbished for
</I>&gt;<i> modern usage.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> ] IntroductionIntroduction: End of the &quot;Great Debate&quot;, by David Ellerman:
</I>&gt;<i> The Great Debate between Capitalism and Socialism is at last over. The free
</I>&gt;<i> market and private property have decisively won. Does that mean the &quot;end of
</I>&gt;<i> ideology&quot; or the &quot;end of history&quot;? Can we rest assured that there are no
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental structural flaws in the western-style economy? Our legal system
</I>&gt;<i> is structured to forbid discrimination on the basis of race, but racism
</I>&gt;<i> persists. Is that the only type of social problem that remains&#8211;where the
</I>&gt;<i> structure is correct in principle but the implementation is flawed?
</I>&gt;<i> We shall argue that the current western-style economic system is
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally and structurally flawed. The problems are not just in the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of sound principles. Moreover, we shall argue that the system
</I>&gt;<i> is flawed because it violates the principles of the institutions that are
</I>&gt;<i> usually associated with capitalism. That is, it violates the basic
</I>&gt;<i> principles of both private property and democracy. From the conventional
</I>&gt;<i> point of view, this will seem to be a strange position. Isn't capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> usually identified with private property and democracy? That identification
</I>&gt;<i> has been based on the Great Capitalism-Socialism Debate, on assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the alternative&quot; to capitalism is state ownership of businesses and
</I>&gt;<i> one-party dictatorships. But that debate is over, and accordingly capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> can now be evaluated in a new light.
</I>&gt;<i> Since &quot;capitalism&quot; is so often definitionally identified with a private
</I>&gt;<i> property market economy, we must give a more precise definition of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capitalism&quot; so that we are not just arguing about definitions. By
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capitalism&quot; we mean production organized on the basis of the
</I>&gt;<i> employer-employee relationship. We shall also use &quot;the employment system&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;employer-employee system&quot; as more accurate but less known names of the
</I>&gt;<i> system based on the employer-employee relation. The alternative is a private
</I>&gt;<i> property market economy where everyone is self-employed (individually or
</I>&gt;<i> jointly) in their workplace. A firm where the managers and workers are
</I>&gt;<i> jointly working for themselves will be called a &quot;self-employment firm,&quot; a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;worker-owned firm&quot; (where &quot;worker&quot; always includes all who work in the
</I>&gt;<i> business enterprise), or a &quot;democratic firm&quot; in contrast to the conventional
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capitalist firm&quot; or &quot;employment firm.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The basis question is this &#8211;the employer-employee relation or universal
</I>&gt;<i> self-employment in the workplace?
</I>&gt;<i> We shall have more that one occasion to use a slavery analogy. Consider a
</I>&gt;<i> private property market economy where the workers were largely privately
</I>&gt;<i> owned slaves, like the American economy before the Civil War. Suppose the
</I>&gt;<i> defenders of such a system managed to restrict consideration of an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to a system of state businesses with state or socially owned
</I>&gt;<i> slaves. The &quot;Great Debate&quot; would be between the &quot;Athenian&quot; model of
</I>&gt;<i> privately owned slaves and the &quot;Spartian&quot; model of publicly owned slaves.
</I>&gt;<i> The Athenian model would most likely be more efficient. Over the years, it
</I>&gt;<i> would demonstrate its superior efficiency while the Spartian model might
</I>&gt;<i> eventually collapse under its own weight. Would the victory of the Athenian
</I>&gt;<i> model of private slave ownership signal the &quot;end of history&quot;? Would the
</I>&gt;<i> victory mean that the Athenian model contained no structural flaws, only
</I>&gt;<i> problems of implementing otherwise correct principles?
</I>&gt;<i> The Great Debate of our day has been similar except that the question has
</I>&gt;<i> been the voluntary private or public hiring (or renting) of workers instead
</I>&gt;<i> of the private or public ownership of workers. In spite of its political
</I>&gt;<i> importance, the public-private debate has been conceptually wrong-headed
</I>&gt;<i> from the beginning. The real question about slavery is not the public or
</I>&gt;<i> private ownership of slaves but whether the master-slave relationship should
</I>&gt;<i> be allowed (involuntarily or voluntarily) or should people always be
</I>&gt;<i> self-owning (which implies that the right of self-determination should be
</I>&gt;<i> inalienable even with consent). Today, the real question is not about the
</I>&gt;<i> public or private employment of workers (as it was in the
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism-socialism debate). The question is: should the hiring or renting
</I>&gt;<i> of people be allowed at all or should people always be self-employed in the
</I>&gt;<i> their place of work?
</I>&gt;<i> Some would say that the universal self-employment system should be
</I>&gt;<i> presented as a variant of capitalism rather than an alternative. That may
</I>&gt;<i> be; there is no need to argue only about words. But there are conceptual and
</I>&gt;<i> historical reasons to use the word &quot;capitalism&quot; exclusively to represent the
</I>&gt;<i> employer-employee system so long as one is clear, precise, and explicit
</I>&gt;<i> about that usage. When people are self-employed in their firms, then the
</I>&gt;<i> suppliers of capital are not hiring the workers. Labor (in the sense of all
</I>&gt;<i> the people, managers and blue-collar workers, who work in the firm) is
</I>&gt;<i> hiring capital. Since Labor would then be the &quot;residual claimant&quot; (the party
</I>&gt;<i> receiving the profits left from the revenues after the costs are covered),
</I>&gt;<i> it would be odd to call that arrangement a variant of &quot;capital-ism.&quot; In any
</I>&gt;<i> case, *the reader has been forewarned; &quot;capitalism&quot; herein refers to the
</I>&gt;<i> use of the employer-employee system. The alternative is a private property
</I>&gt;<i> market economy based on universal self-employment*.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have considered a number of areas where conventional economics is
</I>&gt;<i> directly at odds with the legal structure of the western democracies.
</I>&gt;<i> Modern legal systems &#183; prohibit vote-selling by citizens,
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; prohibit voluntary self-sale contracts between adults,
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; take basic political rights of self-determination to be inalienable,
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; would not recognize any political pactum subjectionis, and
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; impute responsibility only to persons (never to things regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> their &quot;productivity&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> All these practices are in direct conflict with the most fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations of conventional economics. On the one hand, economics does
</I>&gt;<i> not advocate that these practices be changed to be consistent with economic
</I>&gt;<i> theory and, on the other hand, it does not give a coherent and uncontrived
</I>&gt;<i> explanation of why these practices should be considered as &quot;exceptions.&quot; In
</I>&gt;<i> short, economics tends to duck these basic issues. There have always been
</I>&gt;<i> these intimations of structural shortcomings, lacuna, and flaws in
</I>&gt;<i> conventional economics. Economics has only seemed to be coherent and
</I>&gt;<i> complete theory because it chooses to ignore the paradigm-threatening
</I>&gt;<i> discrepancies between the theory and the legal structure of the modern
</I>&gt;<i> western democracies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discrepancies outlined above between received economics and modern
</I>&gt;<i> legal systems are not minor problems that can be patched up without
</I>&gt;<i> disturbing the basic paradigm of neo-classical theory. They drive to the
</I>&gt;<i> core of the notions of property and contract. Hence this book is about
</I>&gt;<i> property and contract. It is not simply that the concepts of standard
</I>&gt;<i> economics need to be applied with even more cleverness to resolve these
</I>&gt;<i> discrepancies. New concepts need to be developed&#8211;or rather old concepts need
</I>&gt;<i> to be rediscovered, dusted off, and represented in modern terms. Hence our
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical discussions will be interrupted by forays into the intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> history of ideas almost totally unknown in the conventional histories of
</I>&gt;<i> economic thought.&quot; (
