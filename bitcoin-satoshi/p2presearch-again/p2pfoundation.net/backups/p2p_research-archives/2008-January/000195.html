<PRE>Very well put Sam,again, can I put this in the blog? Or can I have a general
agreement by all, or by some people, that I may refract this material on
occasion. You guys know my style I think, I always source the material, am
careful of context, etc...

&gt;<i> I agree that it exists still, as do many components of the legacy of
</I>&gt;<i> earlier eras. I also agree that people use the word &quot;class&quot; in more than one
</I>&gt;<i> way. I understand the paradigms of emancipatory tradition. I agree that
</I>&gt;<i> there are objective structural conditions in society. I agree it's possible
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;classify&quot; them, based on many different ways of measuring, including
</I>&gt;<i> income, quality of life, etc. I tend to find some of the classification
</I>&gt;<i> systems we employ, both in general discourse, and in more academic circles,
</I>&gt;<i> limiting. Limiting to both our quest to understand the nature of humans, and
</I>&gt;<i> limiting to the people who come to accept their classification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, I also try to understand human nature, not just through the world
</I>&gt;<i> view of academic and philosophical viewpoints, but also equally through the
</I>&gt;<i> complex adaptive, bio-psycho-social-systems active in the majority of people
</I>&gt;<i> in the world, who are processing and acting from a viewpoint that is
</I>&gt;<i> generally not literate of the concepts that you describe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I ask &quot;why are there objective, structural conditions in society? Why
</I>&gt;<i> do some people end up in some 'class' in society? Why are some people
</I>&gt;<i> reacting against the notion of being part of a class?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My argument is that quite a significant amount of people do not even know,
</I>&gt;<i> nor understand that they are adopting and adapting to external conditions by
</I>&gt;<i> solving problems in a &quot;peer production&quot; fashion. Instead, these people are
</I>&gt;<i> gravitating towards these ways of solving problems, because the pressure of
</I>&gt;<i> the conditions of the existing social paradigm is compelling them towards
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many more dimensions to the emergence of &quot;p2p&quot; human phenomenon
</I>&gt;<i> than I've often seen or heard being discussed. These dynamics of shifts in
</I>&gt;<i> human nature have, at the same time, at least a biological, a psychological,
</I>&gt;<i> and a social/complex environmental component. Integral theory is useful, but
</I>&gt;<i> often unfortunately not understood. I think integral theory was successful
</I>&gt;<i> in accurately packaging multiple complexities, and emergent patterns into
</I>&gt;<i> useful shorthand terms before very many people outside of a small circle of
</I>&gt;<i> academics were able to understand and comprehend how it all is
</I>&gt;<i> inter-related.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am starting to outline a &quot;Literacy of Human Nature&quot; here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://communitywiki.org/en/LiteracyOfHumanNature">http://communitywiki.org/en/LiteracyOfHumanNature</A> that attempts to explore
</I>&gt;<i> how these dimensions and factors fit together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those different factors combine to affect the emergence of humans who
</I>&gt;<i> solve their problems of existence by carrying out activities in a &quot;peer
</I>&gt;<i> production&quot; fashion. I think that many of those very people actually intuit
</I>&gt;<i> the confining nature of being regarded as being part of a &quot;class&quot;.  So, some
</I>&gt;<i> of them seek and find ways of solving existential problems in ways that seem
</I>&gt;<i> to them to obsolete the dominance of the &quot;class&quot; paradigm. Not abolish
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;class&quot;, but to make it irrelevant and obsolete, and impotent in their own
</I>&gt;<i> lives, and the lives of those connected with them. A quaint, old-fashioned
</I>&gt;<i> notion, like the dusty old books about eugenics that you can find in the
</I>&gt;<i> basement archive of our local university library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The need to frame and define an emerging new phenomenon as the &quot;Rise of a
</I>&gt;<i> new class&quot; is especially ironic to me, when the people under consideration
</I>&gt;<i> in the case of &quot;p2p&quot; phenomena appear to me to be rejecting &quot;class&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> that rejection,  in my observation and estimation,  is one of their core
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental assumptions about how to solve their problems of existence. The
</I>&gt;<i> definition of people as part of a &quot;class&quot; is too limiting, even if it
</I>&gt;<i> originates in widely accepted academic roots. It confines the &quot;view&quot; too
</I>&gt;<i> narrowly, and even when employed from academic/critical/emancipatory
</I>&gt;<i> tradition, tends to confine understanding to a very few people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My observation is that the need or desire to frame emerging human
</I>&gt;<i> phenomenon in terms of &quot;class&quot; is actually more often than not employed
</I>&gt;<i> *because* of it's confining properties. Because it reinforces the limited
</I>&gt;<i> concepts it refers to. Plus, it's a headline component that is guaranteed to
</I>&gt;<i> grab some readers :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't see Marx as the penultimate go-to filter through which to
</I>&gt;<i> understand p2p phenomena. I see Marx as one man who thought about this a
</I>&gt;<i> while ago, and articulated his thoughts very well. Yet, I see that many
</I>&gt;<i> people are able to intuit and act upon their conditions of existence, and
</I>&gt;<i> their existential problems in ways that I have never seen described by Marx,
</I>&gt;<i> nor very many other people. The best way that I have found to date
</I>&gt;<i> understand &quot;why&quot; these people are doing this, &quot;what is in it for them?&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;who is doing what to whom, and why?&quot; is to look at the bio-psycho-social
</I>&gt;<i> conditions of existence, and to think about how this human bio-psycho-social
</I>&gt;<i> system fits into larger complex systems. Looking at it this way immediately
</I>&gt;<i> reveals to me that this is *not* a &quot;mass-culture&quot; phenomenon. It is not the
</I>&gt;<i> rise of a &quot;class&quot; of people in society. Instead it is a simultaneous
</I>&gt;<i> localized emergence of ways of solving problems that is a reaction to the
</I>&gt;<i> breakdown, corrosion, and failure of existing mass culture social, economic,
</I>&gt;<i> political, and other infrastructure. Many of these failures and breakdowns
</I>&gt;<i> are rooted in the fundamental need to establish caste, class, and other
</I>&gt;<i> stratified barriers among people, so as to establish &quot;one-up/one-down&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> relationships with people, for the purposes of control of people and
</I>&gt;<i> resources.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sam,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I must partly disagree with you. That there is differentiation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity, individualization does not mean there are no objective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structural conditions in society, though of course people within a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structural condition may behave in different fashions. I think class in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; US is used in a descriptive, psycho-social fashion, but that is not how it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is used within the emancipatory tradition. This being said, the original aim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Marx was not different than yours, i.e. analysing class, but in order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to supersede and abolish them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that peer to peer, if we use an integral methodology, should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recognized as both a (inter)subjective and (inter)objective phenomenom, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that inquiries into its objective side, make sense and can be illuminating.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is both the cause and the effect of new structural conditions, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes class configurations that are changing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This being said, giving a class analysis of peer to peer trends is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy matter, since it is both the expression of new groups of people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responding to new structural conditions and possibilities, but at the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time a  general change in life practice that affects everybody.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, in practical terms in my own work, I do generally avoid 'class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language', as it has mostly antagonizing and dysfunctional results, but that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not mean that thinking about it is superfluous,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I also agree with your statement that peer to peer in fact reflects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a very basic desire to be emancipated of class, but that doesn't mean it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't 'exist' still,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; By framing all emerging new behavior as a the &quot;rise of a new class&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this puts the new behavior in a context that it can be potentially studied,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and ultimately co-opted and/or controlled to benefit systems and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; beneficiaries of (what I calling) mass culture.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Think about how &quot;class&quot; is usually employed as a descriptor: &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; working class, the management class&quot; etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's my opinion that one of the key, vital components of social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; systems that afford healthy peer to peer activity is the widespread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rejection of &quot;class&quot;-systems of people, among people. A shift in the focus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of fundamental motivators, from a motivation in control of the perceivable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; world towards materialistic gain, to a way of solving problems that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; motivated by a newfound realization of the nature and value of humans,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; living systems, resources is free and un-controlled things, who must be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; listened to, to be understood, and who are not just another &quot;resource&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; are actual people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is what David Korten is talking about with his idea of a &quot;Great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Turning&quot; from &quot;Empire&quot; to &quot;Earth Community&quot;. It's what Clare W. Graves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; talked about in explaining his research of human value systems, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pattern of fundamental assumptions of humans that he recognized being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; centered around individual materialistic gain, and the subsequent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fundamental assumption that emerged that found people instead focusing on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; person-to-person sharing, and commons-based economies. Graves observed that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the latter did not go about thinking about people in terms of &quot;classes&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; much, and instead radically insisted that all people are &quot;equal&quot;. Graves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then observed that a new type of individual emerged from *these* groups (at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; least in the western world), who rejected the totally &quot;equal&quot; notion, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; did see differences in people, but the differences were in *thinking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; systems*, the way that people solved problems, and not in people themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is a recognition that people's total &quot;world&quot; view is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; combination of internal dynamic neuronal systems, *and* external life
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; conditions.  There is (at least) a biological &quot;scale&quot;, and a psycho-social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;scale&quot;,and an environment &quot;scale&quot; to be observed in total system of a human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and it's environment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think the usual notion of &quot;class&quot; strips away much of the complexity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the human condition, and re-inforces the illusion in people's minds that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; human conditions are highly &quot;fixed&quot;. I'm interested in &quot;p2p&quot; ideas, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think they leverage the potentials that were already there in the total
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; human system (internal bio systems, and external environment) to explode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;classes&quot; from within.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's interesting to me that the building blocks now exist that allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; many, many people to defy being classified, and to avoid having to settle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; into a socio-cultural &quot;role&quot;/strata. Yet, I observe that many people do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyway. Even people as young as 20 years old. Of course, it's due to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; legacy of mass culture, and it's design to reinforce those roles. But, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you talk to many of those people, they will readily admit that they do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desire their pre-assigned &quot;role&quot;, but they accept or adopt it, because it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; perceived as being &quot;needed&quot; to survive in existing culture. So, not wanting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to be part of a &quot;class&quot; is one potential that I see, along with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; conditions that make it possible for a person to live in such a way as to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; defy easy classification within existing systems. People who can now produce
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their own mass media, people who can now collectively create and grow and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fund the collection of knowledge. People who can design and release
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; technology as part of a commons that they co-maintain. Those collections of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people are usually made up of people from many different traditional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; economic &quot;classes&quot;.
