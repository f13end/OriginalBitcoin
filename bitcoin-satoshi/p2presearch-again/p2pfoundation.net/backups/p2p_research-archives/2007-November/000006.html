<PRE>much thx
lots of nodes in there to connect to other things....

At the very least, we have a lot of literature and history of
engagement in political theory with the paradox of tolerance:  to
tolerate the intolerant?  whom to tolerate?

&gt;<i>From Locke's vision of a bounded tolerance, to Montaigne's
</I>(e?)valuation and exclusion of those without pants ( ;-) )  toleration
always ressurrects the basic political problem of inclustion/exclusion
and NEVER solves or circumvents it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might know my second space, but do you know my first? Do I even
</I>&gt;<i> know? In this time of ubiquitous media, the territory of offline
</I>&gt;<i> existence is increasingly harder to define. These days you've made it
</I>&gt;<i> when you're able to log off. Google narcissism services our curious
</I>&gt;<i> and always fragile egos, but after 50 pages the attraction has either
</I>&gt;<i> worn off, run out or turned into Japanese. Like Pavlov's salivating
</I>&gt;<i> dog, we return a month later to the algorhythmic mirror to work out
</I>&gt;<i> what's gone on in our life. Who's listening, who's reading, who's
</I>&gt;<i> watching, who's appraising, who's attacking? Who knows and who cares?
</I>&gt;<i> Just feed me data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the society of voluntary exposure, practice has outstripped
</I>&gt;<i> pedagogy. Speed is the default of dissemination. And someone else is
</I>&gt;<i> making bucks out of your expenditure of energy. Success requires a re-
</I>&gt;<i> engineering of time. In the competitive attention economy of creative
</I>&gt;<i> networks, cultural production becomes an art of lingering and
</I>&gt;<i> resonance. Zero comments are equivalent to the dead link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MySpace and Facebook continue the social networking tradition of
</I>&gt;<i> compiling friends. But who are your enemies? What do friends mean for
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative constitution? What happens to the creative logic of
</I>&gt;<i> constitutive tension when all you have is endless affirmation? Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> you go on a demo for the palpable thrill of confrontation, but where,
</I>&gt;<i> really, is your enemy? Watching the replay three days later from a
</I>&gt;<i> hundred CCTV recordings that your income tax paid for. Therein lies
</I>&gt;<i> the auto-erotic drive of opposition. The imaginary reigns supreme.
</I>&gt;<i> And you pay for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the role of critique in this kind of environment? With the
</I>&gt;<i> Rise of the easyJet Class, some suggest that critique serves to
</I>&gt;<i> eradicate the possibility of hotbeds of creativity.[1] Like
</I>&gt;<i> politicians and mediocre consultants, critics contribute to the dirty
</I>&gt;<i> appeal of emergent 'creative cities'. Berlin is 'poor but sexy',
</I>&gt;<i> claims the city mayor. Now that it can boast number one ranking
</I>&gt;<i> according to the Floridarian spin-index of '3 T's' &#8211; Talent,
</I>&gt;<i> Technology and Tolerance &#8211; Berlin is supposedly guaranteed of
</I>&gt;<i> development via its creative economy.[2] The message? Stay Poor and
</I>&gt;<i> Move East to Get Rich Fast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what happens then? Welcome to the Desert of a non-English Real.
</I>&gt;<i> Your networks develop within the ghetto of Euro-American exodus. Self-
</I>&gt;<i> affirmation, but with a difference. Everything is fast, dust sticks,
</I>&gt;<i> lungs collapse but value is added in immaterial ways. Everyone awaits
</I>&gt;<i> the call of repatriation. It's a gamble against time, and the updated
</I>&gt;<i> graduates of instituted creativity are stacking up fast. This sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like evolutionary economics all over again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TV real-estate shows belt out the mantra 'Location, Location,
</I>&gt;<i> Location!' Tune in or give up. If you don't have enough savings, then
</I>&gt;<i> take a mortgage out on life. It'll only cost you. But seriously, how
</I>&gt;<i> and where do we locate ourselves in an era of rapidly diminishing
</I>&gt;<i> returns? We know that every act of consumption is one of ecological
</I>&gt;<i> destruction. Is the Slow Movement the only answer? Even that has
</I>&gt;<i> succumbed to a dependency on earnest consumption by the Enlightened
</I>&gt;<i> Middle Classes. Bring back the commons, we are told. But that only
</I>&gt;<i> welcomes proprietary control through the backdoor cult of
</I>&gt;<i> libertarianism. Free is only so good insofar as you've got a Second
</I>&gt;<i> Life of income generation on the side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing in his twilight years of productivity &#8211; the late 40s and
</I>&gt;<i> early 50s &#8211; the Canadian political economist and communications
</I>&gt;<i> theorist Harold Innis discerned a 'bias of communication' operating
</I>&gt;<i> across the epochs of civilization. His novel insight was to connect
</I>&gt;<i> the materiality of communications media with time and space.
</I>&gt;<i> Examining the relation between the continuity of empires over time
</I>&gt;<i> and their extension across space, Innis concluded, in correct
</I>&gt;<i> negative fashion, that the history of mediated human life
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated that it was always off-balance. 'Monopolies of
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge', he argued, are shaped by the spatial and temporal
</I>&gt;<i> properties of technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The clay writing tablet in Ancient Babylonia endured over time,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas the invention of papyrus by Egyptians enabled easy
</I>&gt;<i> dissemination across space. The downfall of each of these empires was
</I>&gt;<i> a result, he argues, of their bias of communication. Time or space.
</I>&gt;<i> The secular technology of papyrus in Egypt marginalized a monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> whose control over time centred around the use of stone and
</I>&gt;<i> hieroglyphics. The Assyrians invaded Babylon due to their superior
</I>&gt;<i> technologies of speed: the stirrup, chariot and experiments in horse-
</I>&gt;<i> breeding made possible the rapid transport of cavalry across space,
</I>&gt;<i> conquering the religious administration of Babylon. Without an
</I>&gt;<i> adequate military reserve, the bureaucratic apparatus of an alluvial
</I>&gt;<i> empire and its rule of law came tumbling down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What lessons might we gain from the history of technology and
</I>&gt;<i> culture? Explicit in Innis' archaeology is an acknowledgment of the
</I>&gt;<i> relationship between media, culture and the enemy. The enemy is
</I>&gt;<i> revealed through the bias of communication. But how do we identify
</I>&gt;<i> the enemy in social networking technologies that have one option
</I>&gt;<i> only: links to our friends? In social networking sites such as
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook, the enemy is loaded into the space-time continuum: often
</I>&gt;<i> pictured but never present. Your friends make it impossible to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> enemies.  Indeed, they can only be your friends. The enemy is never a
</I>&gt;<i> guest blogger. Does the anonymous comment register the enemy voice,
</I>&gt;<i> or the friend passing as enemy? We never know. What is an enemy
</I>&gt;<i> without a face?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'I don't waste time despising people', writes American legal
</I>&gt;<i> philosopher Martha Nussbaum in The Guardian's Weekend magazine.
</I>&gt;<i> 'Anger is much more constructive than contempt'.[3] Emotions are fine
</I>&gt;<i> so long as they can be made productive. Nussbaum's protestant
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentalisation of affect holds similarities with Facebook. There
</I>&gt;<i> is no tragedy. There is no surprise. These are not options. The
</I>&gt;<i> limits of Facebook are revealed through the trope of irony. One of my
</I>&gt;<i> 'Very Conservative' friends with 'Serious' religious views, whose
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook face looks distinctly psychotic, discloses a failed romance
</I>&gt;<i> we never had. This bi-modal form of public outing as conservative and
</I>&gt;<i> gay within the closed circuit of friends might function as a minor
</I>&gt;<i> disruptive device. But this is hardly a case of conflictual
</I>&gt;<i> constitution. Instead, it gestures toward an uneven networked
</I>&gt;<i> sociality of knowledge and affective proximity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing of consequence is at stake. Potential conflict is subsumed
</I>&gt;<i> within the Facebook code of tolerance. The technics give you no other
</I>&gt;<i> choice. The logic of tolerance reaffirms a cool, liberal world-view.
</I>&gt;<i> Zizek is the exemplary embodiment of Facebook. His intolerance of
</I>&gt;<i> tolerance is another variation of the ironic trope. Fightclub 2.0.
</I>&gt;<i> And this is why nasty hate sites are so refreshing: their non-ironic
</I>&gt;<i> mode broadcasts intolerance right from the start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'Tolerance is Suicide', declares W.A.R. &#8211; White Aryan Resistance.[4]
</I>&gt;<i> Yet hate sites in many ways are no different from their liberal
</I>&gt;<i> counter-parts of networked affirmation. In both cases the addressee
</I>&gt;<i> is always absent. They are never there, only you and your friends.
</I>&gt;<i> With their form of indirect address, the disruptive potential of
</I>&gt;<i> noise is rendered inoperable. There is no constitutive outside when
</I>&gt;<i> you are blasting out hate or confirming your friends. We are not
</I>&gt;<i> talking about cybernetics here. Nor, really, are we talking about
</I>&gt;<i> networks. It's all about associative desires. And if you're migrating
</I>&gt;<i> to Facebook from the proletarian parametres of MySpace, then you're
</I>&gt;<i> displaying symptoms of the aspirational impulse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're in any doubt about these claims, then go visit a site
</I>&gt;<i> extolling the virtues of pet hate. Holy Shmoly!'s blog posts an entry
</I>&gt;<i> on '8 reasons to hate cats'. With 355 comments, this rates as an A-
</I>&gt;<i> list blog for sure. RICHSRD CAT HATER: 'CATS ARE SHIT!!!! THEY SHOULD
</I>&gt;<i> ALL DIE!!! SO SHOULD BIRDS'. some guy: 'cats have a use by date, just
</I>&gt;<i> like food'. Tim: 'I hate fucking cats. the only fun part about a cat
</I>&gt;<i> is blasting the hell out of it with a .22 rifle. the sons of a
</I>&gt;<i> bitches should all die. indpendant lil bastards, fuck them all!'
</I>&gt;<i> Jacky (smart scots girl): 'P.S. We eat cats in Scotland'. matt: 'How
</I>&gt;<i> do you make a cat go woof? Dowse it in gas and light a match'.[5]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Online, nobody knows the person you hate is actually a dog. [6]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is where activist cartographies of media control come in handy.
</I>&gt;<i> The database technographies of Josh On's 'They Rule' and Bureau
</I>&gt;<i> d'&#233;tudes' maps of the military-industrial complex combine political
</I>&gt;<i> economy with the aesthetics of design. At best, they conjure a
</I>&gt;<i> project of collaborative research that cuts through a particular
</I>&gt;<i> slice of time. As web 1.0 productions, these are not cultural
</I>&gt;<i> technologies of real-time. Both inform us of the relation between
</I>&gt;<i> institutional and individual interests. Combined assets are revealed.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is hard not to be seduced by the aesthetics of presentation in
</I>&gt;<i> both of these works. Part of their success derives from a recognition
</I>&gt;<i> factor. They Rule affirms our sense of how networks appear, but not
</I>&gt;<i> how they might change. And for all its amazing research, the
</I>&gt;<i> cartographies of Bureau d'&#233;tudes resemble the Paris, London or Berlin
</I>&gt;<i> metro systems, albeit in a Stalinesque aesthetic form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with many media of vision, what we find in both of these examples
</I>&gt;<i> is a bias toward space. Relations are mapped, but changes over time
</I>&gt;<i> are nowhere to be found. The advent of open and interactive databases
</I>&gt;<i> corrects this imbalance, to a certain extent. OpenStreetMap.org is a
</I>&gt;<i> good example.[7] Brought to my attention by the Ljubljanian free
</I>&gt;<i> software activist Luka Frelih, openstreetmap integrates GPS mapping
</I>&gt;<i> technologies with a non-proprietary value system. It invites a
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative platform for users to create an open version of
</I>&gt;<i> everyday orientation. Using handheld GPS data loggers as a system of
</I>&gt;<i> real-time updating of abstracted space, openstreetmap would seem to
</I>&gt;<i> deliver Innis' dream of social-technological balance: a technic of
</I>&gt;<i> communication predisposed to neither time nor space, but both,
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously. In time, across space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While it's low on eye-candy, opensteetmap is a great example of
</I>&gt;<i> techno-sociality that is secondary to outcomes &#8211; the generation of
</I>&gt;<i> maps &#8211; but primary as a condition of possibility. First and foremost,
</I>&gt;<i> openstreetmap invokes the potentiality of communication as a mode of
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative constitution. For all the joy and narco-gratification
</I>&gt;<i> that attends social networking technologies such as MySpace, in the
</I>&gt;<i> first instance these are technologies of solitude. Don't get me
</I>&gt;<i> wrong: I'm not a great fan of mingling with the masses. Despite the
</I>&gt;<i> pernicious dimensions of individualised sociality, there are few who
</I>&gt;<i> don't find considerable relief when exiting the office.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm suggesting, then, is that collaborative constitution is
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily an uncertain, unpredictable endeavour. It resists easy
</I>&gt;<i> formulation. Concepts are contextual. Experimentation is key, and
</I>&gt;<i> experience is crucial. Those who insist on predefined outcomes and
</I>&gt;<i> lists of deliverables will only be disappointed. But such agents of
</I>&gt;<i> administrative anxiety are essential for the collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> constitution of creativity. See these procedural types as conflict
</I>&gt;<i> generators that wish to police the borders of reason and the act of
</I>&gt;<i> action. Don't be concerned about the registration of denial. The
</I>&gt;<i> negative affect will undoubtedly take hold and propel your
</I>&gt;<i> investigation in one direction or many.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what to make of all of this? Don't reply to that Urgent! Email.
</I>&gt;<i> Tell the boss to take a hike, and bend over instead for your buddy.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe then you make your enemy. Excess is easy. 'Concrete research'
</I>&gt;<i> in order to create 'a strategy of the future' (Tronti) is not. Techno-
</I>&gt;<i> cultures are delicate, that much is certain. Life, even more so.
</I>&gt;<i> There's something to be said for religion. It rates as the most
</I>&gt;<i> successful institution in history. But let's face it, true believers
</I>&gt;<i> are, quite literally, out of it. Our time requires substantial
</I>&gt;<i> readjustment. That much is clear. But where to turn? That, I submit,
</I>&gt;<i> is a question to you.
