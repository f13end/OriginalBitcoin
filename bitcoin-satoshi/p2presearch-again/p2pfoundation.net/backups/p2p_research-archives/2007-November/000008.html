</I>&gt;<i> 'Economic Options for Organizing Networks in Beijing'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notwithstanding the commercialisation of the net, the hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> systems embedded in social-technical infrastructures and dynamics,
</I>&gt;<i> and the impact of national and surpranational government policy on
</I>&gt;<i> network cultures, to what extent can we really speak of a political
</I>&gt;<i> economy of peer-to-peer network practices? If political economy is
</I>&gt;<i> traditionally understood in terms of the role institutions and their
</I>&gt;<i> concomitant interests play in the structuring and regulation of
</I>&gt;<i> economic life, then what might it mean to transpose this axiom to the
</I>&gt;<i> culture of networks? How, in other words, might organized networks as
</I>&gt;<i> nascent institutional forms provide new insights into the political
</I>&gt;<i> economy of peer production? More specifically, how might the social-
</I>&gt;<i> technical properties of organized networks situated within the urban
</I>&gt;<i> and political context of Beijing facilitate new models for
</I>&gt;<i> interventions in local, regional and transnational 'creative
</I>&gt;<i> economies'? What might such activity tell us about the geopolitical
</I>&gt;<i> variations of neoliberal capital? This paper outlines some
</I>&gt;<i> preliminary models of economic sustainability for the OrgNets
</I>&gt;<i> platform and considers the political implications for networks
</I>&gt;<i> cultures that take seriously the problematic of political economy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that a social economy preconditions the possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> a political economy of network cultures. Without a social economy,
</I>&gt;<i> there is no political economy. Indeed, in many instances the social
</I>&gt;<i> economy within p2p networks marginalises or displaces the operative
</I>&gt;<i> force of political economy. Open publishing and bit torrents of
</I>&gt;<i> pirate cinema, software and music are obvious examples that come to
</I>&gt;<i> mind. However, even in these instances of ostensibly 'free
</I>&gt;<i> culture' there lurks in the system a political economy, one that is
</I>&gt;<i> closely connected to infrastructure and info-governance. In a recent
</I>&gt;<i> dialogue with Paul Hartzog, Trebor Scholz frames this tension as
</I>&gt;<i> follows: 'the means of production are available to networked
</I>&gt;<i> publics; these tools and platforms are, however, owned by
</I>&gt;<i> corporations'.[1] Aside from the ever-present potential of unruly
</I>&gt;<i> workers, the trouble so often faced by the owners of infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> is that they suffer from limited imagination. Without a few tinkerers
</I>&gt;<i> in the shop, capital is left without the invention of difference
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for its renewal. Thus a mutually parasitic relation exists
</I>&gt;<i> between owners and users of the means of production. As we know,
</I>&gt;<i> historically this relation is one of constant oscillation that
</I>&gt;<i> constitutes the force of hegemony. A central interest of this
</I>&gt;<i> workshop is to discern how this relation plays out in the p2p culture
</I>&gt;<i> of networks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By way of addressing the question of political economy, I wish to
</I>&gt;<i> focus my talk on the social-technical aspects of an experiment in
</I>&gt;<i> transdisciplinary urban-media research in Beijing built around the
</I>&gt;<i> logic of networks. My interest is in the ways in which such social-
</I>&gt;<i> technical endeavours in institution formation might operate as what
</I>&gt;<i> Fabian Muniesa and Michel Callon term 'economic experiments' that
</I>&gt;<i> shape the construction of markets. The communication of relations
</I>&gt;<i> between emergent institutional forms and their invention of markets
</I>&gt;<i> is underscored by the technics of mediation. Mediation, in turn, is
</I>&gt;<i> registed in the following key forms: systems of governance, rituals
</I>&gt;<i> and materialities of practice, discourses with uncertain borders and
</I>&gt;<i> technologies of collaborative constitution. The arrangement of these
</I>&gt;<i> elements produces new territories for potential exploitation by
</I>&gt;<i> capital. The political and economic challenge is to produce
</I>&gt;<i> interventions into markets that enable economic resources for
</I>&gt;<i> experiments in organizing networks and living wages for participants.
</I>&gt;<i> (Due to constraints of time I will not address typologies of
</I>&gt;<i> mediation in this talk.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OrgNets in Beijing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  From May-July this year I coordinated a transciplinary research
</I>&gt;<i> platform that produced a counter-mapping of the creative industries
</I>&gt;<i> in Beijing.[2] In the first instance this project was financed
</I>&gt;<i> through parasitical means, with funds from the research centre that I
</I>&gt;<i> work in enabling participants from Europe, India, Australia and New
</I>&gt;<i> Zealand to collaborate with local researchers and media practioners
</I>&gt;<i> in Beijing. Such a model of financing research is a one-off, and self-
</I>&gt;<i> generating means of funding are required in order to sustain this
</I>&gt;<i> platform as a partially autonomous research network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By undertaking a collaborative anthropology of new institutional
</I>&gt;<i> forms &#8211; what I term 'organized networks' &#8211; this project is
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the transdisciplinary dimension of creative industries
</I>&gt;<i> in Beijing. The project is organized around six key vectors of research:
</I>&gt;<i>  migrant networks and service labour; network ecologies of creative
</I>&gt;<i> waste; informational geographies vs. creative clusters; centrality of
</I>&gt;<i> real-estate speculation for creative economies; import cultures and
</I>&gt;<i> export innovations in architecture and urban design; and artist
</I>&gt;<i> villages and market engineering. In migrating media education outside
</I>&gt;<i> of the university, the project recomposes media education as a
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative research process focussed on critique and analysis of
</I>&gt;<i> urban transformations and the politics of creative and service labour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project adopted the model of a mobile research laboratory as a
</I>&gt;<i> framework for collaborative research on the creative industries,
</I>&gt;<i> urban transformation and media practice in Beijing. As a laboratory
</I>&gt;<i> the OrgNets project was an assemblage of experimentation and testing,
</I>&gt;<i> one that will continue to develop throughout the next year. And as a
</I>&gt;<i> laboratory, the OrgNet project was excised or temporarily suspended
</I>&gt;<i> from the outside force of the real market. But the mobile and social
</I>&gt;<i> nature of OrgNets makes its borders porous. The distinction between
</I>&gt;<i> inside and outside is not fixed; borders are defined by the continuum
</I>&gt;<i> of change that comes into play with the addition or departure of
</I>&gt;<i> participants, the particularities of urban situations, the topics of
</I>&gt;<i> investigation and the institutions of temporary connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an assemblage whose spatial and temporal coordinates undergo
</I>&gt;<i> constant transformation, the relation between inside and outside is
</I>&gt;<i> subject to processes of translation. It would be a mistake to think
</I>&gt;<i> the range of contingencies &#8211; many of which may register
</I>&gt;<i> imperceptably on the action of networks &#8211; can ever be brought under
</I>&gt;<i> control. But within the territory of the known, faintly perceived and
</I>&gt;<i> vaguely intuited, it is not unreasonable to suppose an economy is
</I>&gt;<i> possible for networks that, at this stage, are without money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the transdisciplinary orientation of the OrgNets project, the
</I>&gt;<i> prevailing policy discourse of creative industries, the intense
</I>&gt;<i> economic and social changes underway in China and the exotic allure
</I>&gt;<i> the city as urban laboratory holds for intellectural tourists, the
</I>&gt;<i> expanding international market of education is an obvious economy
</I>&gt;<i> awaiting intervention by non-traditional 'providers'. In fact,
</I>&gt;<i> this is already the case for mainstream external providers. As an
</I>&gt;<i> outsourced form of education provision, OrgNets offer established
</I>&gt;<i> institutions of education and research the possibility of value-
</I>&gt;<i> adding at a cost that is going to be cheaper than if these
</I>&gt;<i> institutions hired staff on full benefits whose capacity to invent is
</I>&gt;<i> rapidly dulled by the burden of bureacracy and audit cultures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Experimental Economics and Evidence Machines
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The field of experimental economics in its contemporary form emerged
</I>&gt;<i> out of game theory from the late 1940s and early 1950s. Francesco
</I>&gt;<i> Guala notes two distinct approaches within experimental economics &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> theory-testing and institution-building; the former tends toward
</I>&gt;<i> experiments in decision-making, the latter experiments in market
</I>&gt;<i> performativity.[3] Orthodox game theory combines or traverses these
</I>&gt;<i> two approaches, and plays the market as an institution whose
</I>&gt;<i> problematics are 'solved' by rational agents within controlled
</I>&gt;<i> laboratory settings.[4] But what happens in occasions of 'irrational
</I>&gt;<i> exuberance' that define bubble economies, as seen in real-estate
</I>&gt;<i> speculation, dotcom-mania or the caffeine induced palpitations of day
</I>&gt;<i> traders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is undoubtedly a logic at work in such instances, but it is not
</I>&gt;<i> one that conforms to rational intent. The logic of irrational
</I>&gt;<i> economics is one whose particularities are immanent to the
</I>&gt;<i> contingencies of the event. The experimental economics of game theory
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to overcome or at least minimise contingency by designing
</I>&gt;<i> markets in which the desired results come to fruition. The world is
</I>&gt;<i> their laboratory. The structural adjustment programs of the World
</I>&gt;<i> Bank and IMF are good examples of experimental economics in
</I>&gt;<i> operation. However, the desire to see the world in their own image is
</I>&gt;<i> the primary catalyst of failure for such models. Certainly, this
</I>&gt;<i> point is disputable; arguably the model of structural adjustment has
</I>&gt;<i> succeeded insofar as the World Bank and IMF agenda for countries in
</I>&gt;<i> Africa and South America to 'leapfrog modernity' in such a way
</I>&gt;<i> that bypasses European models of state formation into a neoliberal
</I>&gt;<i> paradigm of governmental dependency on outsourcing to private
</I>&gt;<i> providers has proven financially beneficial to foreign investors. But
</I>&gt;<i> such a view is limited in scope, to say the least. The production of
</I>&gt;<i> global poverty and massive disparities in wealth can hardly be rated
</I>&gt;<i> a success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal, then, is to see a project like OrgNets as a form of
</I>&gt;<i> experimental economics that are open to the contigencies of the event
</I>&gt;<i> and the social-technical and disciplinary dynamics of conflictual
</I>&gt;<i> constitution. Contigencies necessitate factoring in the elusive
</I>&gt;<i> dimension of experience. My interest is not to exploit economic or
</I>&gt;<i> social vulnerabilities, but rather to enhance capacities and address
</I>&gt;<i> trans-institutional economic realities and disciplinary foreclosure
</I>&gt;<i> brought about by intellectual property regimes, internal competition
</I>&gt;<i> and limits placed on research by the avalanche of adminstration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The trick with a project like OrgNets is to treat it as a symbiotic
</I>&gt;<i> device that both facilitates the generation of concepts and affects
</I>&gt;<i> the allocation of economic resources. The latter may take the form of
</I>&gt;<i> direct funding, commissions, participant fees for summer schools, or
</I>&gt;<i> in-kind support by institutional partners &#8211; e.g. office space, use
</I>&gt;<i> of equipment, personnel, etc. Of course any proposal to play the
</I>&gt;<i> neoliberal game of outsourcing education is going to meet the wrath
</I>&gt;<i> of some leftists and activists. But it is hypocritical to dish out
</I>&gt;<i> critique without offering alternatives for economic subsistence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Muniesa and Callon refer to platforms (as distinct from laboratories
</I>&gt;<i> and in situ experiments): 'the platform is an intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> configuration, more open to compromises with several kinds of actors
</I>&gt;<i> than the laboratory' and refers to 'flexible organizational forms in
</I>&gt;<i> [sic] where surprise is more a resource than a problem' for
</I>&gt;<i> 'strategic innovation'. OrgNets also share these features of a
</I>&gt;<i> platform &#8211; flexibility, most certainly, but the element of surprise
</I>&gt;<i> is less clear for OrgNets. A genealogy of OrgNets would establish the
</I>&gt;<i> connection with tactical media, reknowned for its hit-and-run
</I>&gt;<i> approach to semiotic warfare. Where OrgNets corresponds with surprise
</I>&gt;<i> is perhaps most clear when OrgNets is brought in to relation with
</I>&gt;<i> established institutions of education and research, namely the
</I>&gt;<i> university, which is characterised by a transdisciplinary deficiency
</I>&gt;<i> and has a limited capacity of invention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a collaborative anthropology of new institutional forms, the
</I>&gt;<i> project investigates how the emergence of organized networks
</I>&gt;<i> illuminate some of the material qualities and tensions of creative
</I>&gt;<i> industries in Beijing. The project holds the precept that
</I>&gt;<i> transdisciplinary urban-media research is an autonomous expressive
</I>&gt;<i> capacity that subsists within a field of translocal and supranational
</I>&gt;<i> structural forces. This is not to suggest a form of structural
</I>&gt;<i> determination, but it is to recognise that tensions of a particular
</I>&gt;<i> order are inherent to media education that refuses the stagnant
</I>&gt;<i> methods and orthodox theoretical approaches that by and large
</I>&gt;<i> characterise the state of play, be that in Chinese universities or
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Neoliberal University
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As government funding for higher education has diminished over the
</I>&gt;<i> past decade (or longer, in some national cases), universities have
</I>&gt;<i> found themselves increasingly positioned within a market economy.
</I>&gt;<i> This structural relation alone locates education as a commodity
</I>&gt;<i> object. Inevitably there will be barriers to access learning in such
</I>&gt;<i> instances. An alternative &#8211; open access learning &#8211; has great
</I>&gt;<i> merit, but there are some fundamental issues to do with cost of
</I>&gt;<i> delivery (labour, production, infrastructure, etc.) and technological
</I>&gt;<i> modes of communication that must be addressed. In building open
</I>&gt;<i> access repositories of research findings, this project investigates
</I>&gt;<i> the connection between peer-to-peer collaboration and new business
</I>&gt;<i> models.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The glacial temporality of university curriculum development and
</I>&gt;<i> subjugation of teachers by the life-depleting demands of audit
</I>&gt;<i> cultures sets a challenge for media education programs that wish to
</I>&gt;<i> synchronise their curricula with the speed of popular media
</I>&gt;<i> literacies. To distinguish market and user hype from quality that
</I>&gt;<i> makes a substantive difference is near impossible. Consensus will not
</I>&gt;<i> be found beyond the fleeting moments of micro-adoption among A-list
</I>&gt;<i> bloggers and their links, or whatever other community of users you
</I>&gt;<i> care to name. Ratified standards for media education within the
</I>&gt;<i> cultures of networks do not exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the university increasingly loses its monopoly on the provision of
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge as a result of neoliberal governance and the advent of peer-
</I>&gt;<i> to-peer and user-producer media systems, media education is in crisis
</I>&gt;<i> mode. Best practice is frequently found outside of university degree
</I>&gt;<i> programs. Expertise has become distributed across a population of
</I>&gt;<i> practioners and everyday users. How, then, might such knowledge feed
</I>&gt;<i> back into university programs? Can formal accreditation for
</I>&gt;<i> autonomous education be extended to non-university actors? Are such
</I>&gt;<i> processes even desirable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Crucial here are the different temporalities afforded by research
</I>&gt;<i> platforms positioned outside of the temporal order of the market and
</I>&gt;<i> its post-Fordist modality of just-in-time production, which
</I>&gt;<i> underscores the habitus of the university today. In a posting earlier
</I>&gt;<i> this year to the edu-factory mailing list &#8211; an initiative by mostly
</I>&gt;<i> young activist researchers associated with Negri's uni-nomadi (an
</I>&gt;<i> informal teaching program across a network of media and social
</I>&gt;<i> centres in Italy) &#8211; Taiwan based academic Jon Solomon phrases the
</I>&gt;<i> predicament of time and the university as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'The students have been so disempowered by the compulsory national
</I>&gt;<i> primary and secondary education system (which favors the production
</I>&gt;<i> of an elite) that when it comes to the university organization of
</I>&gt;<i> their own temporal rythms, they are completely passive in their forms
</I>&gt;<i> of resistance (and the faculty doesn't provide any relief or
</I>&gt;<i> alternative resources)'.[5]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How, then, to create different temporalities which enable process of
</I>&gt;<i> counter-subjectivisation? A number of core elements come into play in
</I>&gt;<i> the repositioning of research and teaching outside of the university.
</I>&gt;<i> And these, I would add, are not without precendents: think of the
</I>&gt;<i> mechanics institutes as sites of popular learning for the working
</I>&gt;<i> classes in the 19th century (albeit enframed by the morally uplifting
</I>&gt;<i> values of the middle-classes), adult education classes after the
</I>&gt;<i> second world war, the rise of alternative schooling movements such as
</I>&gt;<i> Montessori in the 60s and 70s, and so on and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that counter-sites of learning at the current conjuncture
</I>&gt;<i> are imbued with qualities special to the social-technical dimension
</I>&gt;<i> of network cultures, and conditioned by the political economy of the
</I>&gt;<i> informational university.[6]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a pilot study, the counter-mapping project in Beijing provides
</I>&gt;<i> inititial research data for future comparative research that examines
</I>&gt;<i> the inter-relations between geopolitics (regional trade agreements,
</I>&gt;<i> national and multi-lateral policies on labour mobility, security and
</I>&gt;<i> migration, etc.) and the peculiarities of intraregional, translocal
</I>&gt;<i> and global cultural flows within the creative industries. A
</I>&gt;<i> comparative focus on the creative industries enables new questions to
</I>&gt;<i> be asked about the mutually constitutive tensions between these
</I>&gt;<i> forces, practices, histories and policies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project establishes a prototype for new cross-cultural
</I>&gt;<i> educational and research institutions organised about the logic of
</I>&gt;<i> networks. As signalled in policy milestones such as the Bologna
</I>&gt;<i> Process (1999), scholarly monographs and OECD reports, the landscape
</I>&gt;<i> in higher education has been undergoing gradual, and in some
</I>&gt;<i> instances rapid, transformation toward a market model.
</I>&gt;<i> The Bologna Process is more complex than a simple transition toward a
</I>&gt;<i> market model, but its modularization of educational processes should
</I>&gt;<i> nonetheless be considered as a core dynamic of the contemporary
</I>&gt;<i> second wave of globalization (services economy). This dynamic is also
</I>&gt;<i> how educational changes intersect with the emergent economy of
</I>&gt;<i> culture after the first wave (trade) has been nearly completed, which
</I>&gt;<i> is why the Bologna Process holds important implications beyond the
</I>&gt;<i> realm of education.
</I>&gt;<i> The role of universities as exclusive providers of higher education
</I>&gt;<i> is changing as small and medium enterprises obtain government
</I>&gt;<i> accreditation for provision of 'educational services'. We are yet
</I>&gt;<i> to see organisations develop out of the field of network cultures as
</I>&gt;<i> providers of high quality research and teaching.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative practices within the creative industries and network
</I>&gt;<i> cultures are now well established as the primary mode of production
</I>&gt;<i> and communication. The business models which sustain the combination
</I>&gt;<i> of service labour and innovation as they are located on the margins
</I>&gt;<i> of industry are less understood. Primarily comprising of 'informal
</I>&gt;<i> economies' (symbolic, voluntary, word-of-mouth) and sustained
</I>&gt;<i> economically by various forms of financial support (parental, small
</I>&gt;<i> government funds such as the 'citizen wage' or grants,
</I>&gt;<i> associations with universities) and wealth generation (e.g. the 'long
</I>&gt;<i> tail'[7]), there is great scope for further development and
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of new business models.[8]
