<PRE>A couple points:


   1. The connections to the internet are not *free* because &quot;access points&quot;
   are assumed to be connected to the www, which requires someone to pay.
   2. The currency might be great for enabling those who offer an &quot;access
   point&quot; credit for use on other &quot;access points&quot;
   3. Most &quot;organized&quot; mesh nets do not encourage a charge of any kind for
   roaming users.  Example: <A HREF="http://guifi.net/directori">http://guifi.net/directori</A> .  This might just be
   a new class of networks, though.  See FreeTheNet below, which does charge as
   a cooperative.
   4. An alternative currency for access is great, and innovative, but
   exchanging that currency for &quot;cash&quot; may not be desirable as it is not
   standard procedure for mesh nets.  Good idea, though.  It needs to be a
   platform, though.  A platform should be usable, copyable, and extendable.
    Hypothetically, extensions should be usable by others on the platform
   copies.  Walk away complete is the tag line.
   5. Most protocols that happen over the internet can happen between
   machines and a configuration package for local services discovery could be
   very interesting.  Usually local networks are useless except for file
   sharing, and the services are less than ideal in many cases.
   6. The local package for service discovery could be handled/built in a
   way that was &quot;network ambivalant&quot;, as a package that worked on the internet
   or a local network.  Example: keeping a list of media files you are looking
   for and using a collection of programs that search here or there to find you
   sources.
   7. OLPC already does mesh networking in a way significantly similar to
   what you describe <A HREF="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details</A> .  This
   is not typical for the configuration of wireless network cards in machines,
   though it is possible (for some part, at least)
   8. The Meraki company made a mistake and raised the price of their
   hardware so Open-Mesh took over the &quot;higher purpose&quot; of providing BATMAN and
   ROBIN pre-flashed nodes and extenders
   <A HREF="https://www.open-mesh.com/store/categories.php?category=Lowest%252dCost-Mesh">https://www.open-mesh.com/store/categories.php?category=Lowest%252dCost-Mesh</A>
.  FreeTheNet uses Accton routers from OpenMesh, see below.
   9. Changing settings to allow and encourage local services discovery can
   be dangerous.  As a networking professional I will say that 95% of people
   are using default settings on their machine, and these make it almost
   impossible to easily discover local services with changing configurations,
   and that is potentially dangerous.  No more dangerous than using the
   internet, I suppose, but the exploits don't come through the browser,
   necessarily.  See the wifi iphone hack.  The issue is perhaps only different
   in that local network bandwidth is much higher, and so a hole in security
   can be exploited very quickly with big packages.
   <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/technology/23iphone.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/technology/23iphone.html</A>
   10. You don't need to do anything new to accomplish your vision of
   extending the range of a local network across your city.  Just copy what
   <A HREF="http://guifi.net/directori">http://guifi.net/directori</A> is doing and use Open-Mesh routers.  It's
   getting easier, apparently.  I worked on <A HREF="http://freethenet.ca/">http://freethenet.ca/</A> in 2007
   when it was just some guys hacking hardware and figuring out the business
   model.  It was a pain because the first Meraki products were just coming out
   and the team had to write and rewrite the code for the coordinated uplink,
   which allowed the routers to be flashed remotely.  Now it's a coop.  Yay!
    So you can copy them too!  Check out their bylaws here:
   <A HREF="http://www.vonic.ca/about">http://www.vonic.ca/about</A> FreeTheNet and Vonic use a custom DogOnRails
   app for network management, under development in a different form during my
   time.  This is for tracking memberships, I am sure, over the network and
   between access points.  It's also needed because the FreeTheNet model
   through Vonic calls for underwriting extending mesh deep into residential
   areas to supply home connections over a shared network.  A special purpose
   monitoring and optimization software is useful for that kind of thing.
   11. You won't escape governance and I don't know how to conceive of a
   local mesh in such a way.  It still uses hardware made by the machine, and
   it still has to connect to the www, at least for now, through ISP
   connections.  Someone has to pay for that.  Using local mesh for file
   traffic several limits what files are available.  It would take a small city
   to duplicate the power of a Google server farm used to cache partial copies
   of the internet, and that farm would be optimized for the task, unlike a
   city-res-mesh.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually processing power over mesh could also warn credits?

</I>&gt;<i> Just brainstorming as I m walking back and writing on my phone...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What motivates me most,personally,is to have an.emergent autonomous local

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there can be a mobile mesh protocol that can be proposed to run

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps that one way of doing it,in a granular and emergent way... ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case,where does one start?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using open hardware and old pc' to contribute to existing meshes, and find
</I>&gt;<i> existing tools to easily enable compatibility between Batman and mobile
</I>mesh
&gt;<i> protocols,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using an easy to install module for android and iPhone's?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess its still a dream...
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the time is not ripe yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still need to wait till 10 dollar open hardware ,with wifi and pre
</I>installed
&gt;<i> (and configurable) open source software enabling mesh protocols?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or is the current 30 to 50 dollar node making it viable in high density

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Dante,
</I>&gt;<i> what you are saying is actually the business model of FON. You install one
</I>&gt;<i> of their low-cost wireless modems permitting other &quot;foneros&quot; who happen to
</I>&gt;<i> be close by, to use your connection via WiFi, and in exchange you get to
</I>use
&gt;<i> the connections of others who also have installed a &quot;la fonera&quot; FON modem.
</I>&gt;<i> They are making those wireless modems available at a low price, but the
</I>&gt;<i> technology is not as advanced as it should be. The reach is definitely too
</I>&gt;<i> short to be really useful, and the FON wireless access points don't make a
</I>&gt;<i> network, they don't talk to each other. The model of FON is sharing your
</I>&gt;<i> connection and getting access in a similar way from others.
</I>&gt;<i> Meraki, I believe, is different, in that their modems actually do form an
</I>&gt;<i> ad-hoc network by talking to each other. They are also using cheap
</I>wireless
&gt;<i> modems that extend, to some degree, the area of coverage of one or more
</I>&gt;<i> single &quot;real&quot; internet connections to a group of users. Meraki is
</I>&gt;<i> commercial, just like FON. They were trying to roll out a network over San
</I>&gt;<i> Francisco, but have scaled back their expectations, I believe. None of
</I>those
&gt;<i> two have really had a great growth or a breakthrough.
</I>&gt;<i> There is also an open source Meraki, so to speak, which is, I believe,
</I>&gt;<i> called Open Mesh. If I remember correctly, they concentrate on
</I>B.A.T.M.A.N.
&gt;<i> which is a routing protocol that allows mesh networks to form. They work
</I>by
&gt;<i> changing the flash memory of certain compatible commercially available
</I>&gt;<i> routers.
</I>&gt;<i> The big problem, for now, seems to be the lack of a proper hardware
</I>platform
&gt;<i> to base the network on, that is widely available. That would be the thing
</I>to
&gt;<i> concentrate on. Meraki and FON have hardware, but their drawback is lack
</I>of
&gt;<i> wide reach (WiFi goes only about 30 meters distance in good conditions,
</I>less
&gt;<i> if you have walls to contend with), and the fact that they are commercial,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning they would like to have the whole world converge on themselves,
</I>and
&gt;<i> it doesn't seem to work that way.
</I>&gt;<i> Until we have proper hardware to ensure connectivity, that is widely
</I>&gt;<i> available and that is open to be configured like we want, there is really
</I>no
&gt;<i> way people will jump unto the mesh networking scene, if only because there
</I>&gt;<i> is a lack of opportunity, i.e. they don't know HOW to do it.
