<PRE>I am trying to find out why our species has decided to move so very
far away from local sufficiency toward a dangerous dependecy upon
centralized production.

We have the Land, Water and willing Workers, so what is the problem?

Why don't we grow Almonds, Avocados and Olives, in our cities (where
climates allow)?

Why are there not grape vines, berry bushes and spice plants in all
the places we installed unproductive species?

I think there are some logistic problems we have overlooked and am
trying to enumerate them so each can be addressed.

Please respond if any sound wrong or to add those that are missing.



* GOVERNMENTS

1.) Taxation as our system of funding public works requires everyone
in that jurisdiction pay for every project even if they are not
interested.  It is the primary cause of the &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot;.

2.) There are social mores against governments being truly productive.
 Some may think food should be a public service, but those with enough
would not agree - mostly because of problem #1.

3.) Even if a government were to attempt permaculture, the
representatives would likely not see the benefits of owning the
equipment and hiring the workers, and so would hire a private business
to do the work anyway - and so we, the taxpayers who funded the
project would likely be required to *buy* the products back from
ourselves thereby being exposed to paying profit to those owners and
would also loose the high-level control such as if subgroups wanted to
avoid herbicides/pesticides, etc.



* BUSINESSES

1.) Most businesses view everything in terms of Profit, so would not
care about increasing local resilience but would instead weigh the
decision on how much they could overcharge the customer.

2.) The question would viewed as a choice as to whether the business
should increase their diversity.  Most owners would likely find it a
silly proposition as they see agriculture as a strictly separate
occupation that has nothing to do with their core goals.



* INDIVIDUALS

1.) The owner does not have the time and skill to maintain these more
sensitive organisms and the complex ecosystem they should enjoy.

2.) The owner does not have the time and skill and equipment to
harvest, process and store those products.

3.) There is usually &quot;too much&quot; of each of those products for a single
owner, and so much of the harvest goes to waste, causing logistic
problems of 'mess' and also some psychological trauma.
