<PRE>I wonder how &quot;quality of life&quot; can be handled at all by majority rule.  It
may not be possible.

I know I would prefer to have more granular control over laws and rules that
effect me.

I recollect the arguments that say that if we don't care, as a people
(majority, all of us, you included) for those who can't care for themselves,
then what kind of people are we?

This argument has been stretched pretty thinly as the banks are now the
poorest amongst us, pillars of capitalism that they are, and our majority
opinion doesn't count for much when it goes against what the elected
representatives say is right.

How can standards for the care of children of activities that effect our
mutual environment be governed, then?

I have enjoyed the idea of &quot;bioregions&quot; like watersheds as a beginning type
of governance area or jurisdiction, but much can be said about the kind and
quality of law or regulation that is passed and how it is enacted when it is
designed to improve or secure a potential lifestyle that has an impact on
others.

</I>&gt;<i> Why don't we grow Almonds, Avocados and Olives, in our cities (where

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are some logistic problems we have overlooked and am

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please respond if any sound wrong or to add those that are missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * GOVERNMENTS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Taxation as our system of funding public works requires everyone
</I>&gt;<i> in that jurisdiction pay for every project even if they are not
</I>&gt;<i> interested.  It is the primary cause of the &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) There are social mores against governments being truly productive.
</I>&gt;<i>  Some may think food should be a public service, but those with enough
</I>&gt;<i> would not agree - mostly because of problem #1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) Even if a government were to attempt permaculture, the
</I>&gt;<i> representatives would likely not see the benefits of owning the
</I>&gt;<i> equipment and hiring the workers, and so would hire a private business
</I>&gt;<i> to do the work anyway - and so we, the taxpayers who funded the
</I>&gt;<i> project would likely be required to *buy* the products back from
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves thereby being exposed to paying profit to those owners and
</I>&gt;<i> would also loose the high-level control such as if subgroups wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid herbicides/pesticides, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * BUSINESSES
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Most businesses view everything in terms of Profit, so would not
</I>&gt;<i> care about increasing local resilience but would instead weigh the
</I>&gt;<i> decision on how much they could overcharge the customer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) The question would viewed as a choice as to whether the business
</I>&gt;<i> should increase their diversity.  Most owners would likely find it a
</I>&gt;<i> silly proposition as they see agriculture as a strictly separate
</I>&gt;<i> occupation that has nothing to do with their core goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * INDIVIDUALS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) The owner does not have the time and skill to maintain these more
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive organisms and the complex ecosystem they should enjoy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) The owner does not have the time and skill and equipment to
</I>&gt;<i> harvest, process and store those products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) There is usually &quot;too much&quot; of each of those products for a single
</I>&gt;<i> owner, and so much of the harvest goes to waste, causing logistic
</I>&gt;<i> problems of 'mess' and also some psychological trauma.
