<PRE>Dear friends,

I'm really really happy with the hard work that Gordon Cook has done to
understand and present our approach in his exclusive newsletter that is sent
out to global telecom leaders.

You can find a draft presentation here at
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Examination_of_Michel_Bauwens%27_P2P_Foundation">http://p2pfoundation.net/Examination_of_Michel_Bauwens%27_P2P_Foundation</A>

But please ask the full copy, nearly 40 pages of dense but clear writing,
from Gordon himself, see in cc.

This issue has a long but important disgression contrasting our work and
vision with that of John Robb, whose work I have long admired as well.

It's a really stellar presentation, based on a live interview in Bangkok,
and a reading of our key materials, so I hope that you can help me in
spreading word of this far and wide.

Gordon's blog is here at <A HREF="http://gordoncook.net/wp/">http://gordoncook.net/wp/</A>

(the july issue is devoted to the medical commons ideas of Dr. Zakim, and we
previously featured his work on the election integrity movement and eva
waskell)

so, without further ado, here's a draft presentation with an excerpt from
the intro:

] Foreword

Gordon Cook:

How will we organize our world in the face of rapid technology change? The
speed of technology change and complexity of a global economy are converging
on the institutional infrastructures of finance, government and large
corporations which forces that have left them in a state of siege. This two
part issue will explore these changes in a way that we hope will bring some
focused understanding to what otherwise seems like a world spinning
chaotically out of control.

The situation of global business and the political infrastructure that it
has built as its foundation within states is most persuasively analyzed by
John Seely Brown and his co-authors in the Power of Pull as covered in our
June issue. It leads to a situation where, in the aftermath of the crash, it
seems as though we have an unholy alliance between the globalized firms and
the state. The state is no longer a nation state but has been transformed
into a &#8220;market state&#8221; crafted to support only those citizens that can find
places of employment within its narrowly defined boundary. But such an
arrangement leaves millions, tens of millions out of the picture and sets up
the conditions for what John Robb in his 2007 Brave New War describes as an
insecure future of facing the attacks of global guerrillas engaging in
fourth generation warfare against cumbersome archaic states that can provide
services only to the subset of its citizens that compete in the globalized
battle taking place among the different flavors of &#8220;market-states.&#8221;

We are in a situation where the middle cannot hold.

Ironically for a progressive who used to believe in the power of government
to establish the foundation for a decent life on behalf of its citizens, it
is the government that is stuck helplessly in the middle. Huge cumbersome
and incapable of the agility that is necessary to cope with rapid change.

On one side then we have the big corporations that have co-opted the
machinery of big government to serve their narrow issues. On the other side
we have the vanishing middle class in the US and other market states in one
angry mob and the hungry ill fed ill-housed global masses in another &#8220;side&#8221;&#8230;
both looking with anger and resentment at those enfranchised with wealth and
power.

We find hope however in the existence of two sets of critics: the three
horsemen of the Center for the Study of the Edge who were the focus of our
June issue and the group of people gathered around Michel Bauwens who will
be the focus of this August September issue.



   - *Advice for the &#8220;Firm&#8221;*

In our June issue we looked at John Seely Brown and The Power of Pull &#8211; a
very powerful riff on the problems of the big corporations also referred to
by the authors as the &#8220;firm.&#8217; The firm in the 20th century was based on a
transportation infrastructure that, while it continuously improved, did so
slowly and gradually compared to the continuous and non stop revolutions we
have seen from ICT and the global Internet. This meant that the 20th century
firm could be based on a model of predictable change and steady growth and
that the technology and operational patterns behind the firm were planned in
such a way as to achieve operational economies of scale in planning,
producing stockpiling and shipping quantities of products needed to give
large cumbersome slow moving global companies return on assets that would
sustain their operations over time.

However with the introduction of the ICT and internet and now cloud
computing, the former more stable drivers of the push-based economics that
were based on scalable efficiency of mass production have effectively been
replaced. Consequently the firm could no longer produce the same return on
assets, in part because the speed of technology change overwhelmed with the
learning and operational infrastructure inside the firm needed to make
decisions under the older top down, economy-of-scale models.

But now the new ICT infrastructure driving the firm drives it exponentially.
There is no longer a breathing space that permits the administrative
learning on the part of the firm the time needed to catch up. We have
constant disruption. If you have constant technology disruption of the tools
the firm uses to do its job while for your day to day operations you are
still burdened with the same administrative requirements dependent on
stability and predictability, you have no stabile environment on which to
build growth. You may want to look for changes in the firm&#8217;s way of learning
and operation that can leverage its administration to better keep pace with
technology disruption.

If the 20th century was one dependent on scalable efficiency, is the 21st
century one of how you build systems that worry not about scalable
efficiency in production but rather &#8220;about scalable peer based learning.&#8221; If
you can organize the firm to learn faster, you can better keep up with and
appropriately use the technology changes. One of the ways you do this is
learn from each other within the eco-system like Silicon valley, where
learning sloshes across company boundaries.

In the 20th century things moved slowly enough such that you could do
business with stocks of somewhat stabile knowledge. But now in a world of
peer-based learning you have flows, concentric pools of newly developed and
spreading ideas. The question for the firm likely becomes - how do you
participate in flows, how do you participate in ways to create new
knowledge? How do you start thinking about creation platforms where new
knowledge is being created all the time?

(This material from a 2009 Seely Brown talk on cloud computing at
<A HREF="http://sprie.stanford.edu/events/recording/5790/1/306">http://sprie.stanford.edu/events/recording/5790/1/306</A>)

The advice given is timely and generally sound. It tells the executives who
run the firms and make strategy that their only choice is to learn more
rapidly and more effectively. It tends not to question the globalized nature
of the firm or its size, although it implies that, in the future, the global
economic organization of firms may become more one of global federations of
smaller and more agile companies operating in loosely construed supply
chains rather than as large multi-national corporations. The Power of Pull
seems to assume that globalization is sustainable long term. We think that
whether or not he is correct remains to be seen.

This issue focuses on a widespread and rapidly growing alternative: the open
knowledge commons of the P2P Foundation. There thousands of independent,
decentralized actors are connected by their local endeavors and the Wiki
constructed by Michel Bauwens and a narrow group of associates.

These people are building an alternative world shaped by open source, local
self-reliance and a shared sense of the urgency of exploring and defining
sustainable futures. I have a sense that the world described in The Power of
Pull and that described by the P2P Foundation have characteristics that
could merge. Let&#8217;s turn then to the the grass roots alternative.

] Introduction

As the world staggers forward and we see to our great regret that President
Obama is not bringing the necessary change but is patching up the old broken
system, meta-issues appear to be more and more relevant. That the &#8220;Internet
changes everything&#8221; has been a truism for more than a decade. The web and
websites give everyone their own printing press. A decade ago the Clue Train
Manifesto noted the symbolic shift in the locus of power. Put productive
tools into the hands of ordinary folk in their homes rather than in
factories and production will tend to shift toward the edge of people&#8217;s
homes and away from the large 20th century Alfred Chandler economy-of-scale
organizations. What emerges are things like open source software and peer
produced ecosystems like Wikipedia and Linux.

In this context, over the past roughly five years a Belgian, Michel Bauwens,
has emerged as the chronicler of and organizer of a small but growing global
community of people involved in building what they call an open knowledge
commons. Michel&#8217;s principal web site is actually a huge Wiki: The Foundation
for P2P Alternatives.

His motto is We study the impact of Peer to Peer technology and thought on
society. See the very extensive page at
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/The_Foundation_for_P2P_Alternatives">http://p2pfoundation.net/The_Foundation_for_P2P_Alternatives</A>

He also runs a blog at: <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/</A> The blog is called
P2P Foundation: researching documenting and promoting peer to peer
practices.

While the subject is very important it has not yet gone mainstream. When I
looked for a basic definitional overview of a knowledge commons, I found
<A HREF="http://integralvisioning.org/article.php?story=p2ptheory1#_Toc107024681">http://integralvisioning.org/article.php?story=p2ptheory1#_Toc107024681</A>


- &#8220;P2P is nothing else than a premise of a new type of civilization that is
not exclusively geared towards the profit motive. What I have to convince
the user is that 1) a particular type of human relational dynamic is growing
very fast across the social fields, and that such combined occurrence is the
result of a deep shift in ways of feeling and being. 2) That it has a
coherent logic that cannot be fully contained within the present `regime' of
society. 3) that it is not an utopia, but, as `an already existing social
practice', the seed of a likely major transformation to come. I will not be
arguing that there is an 'inevitable evolutionary logic at work', but rather
that a new and intentional moral vision, holds the potential for a major
breakthrough in social evolution, leading to the possibility of a new
political, economic, and cultural 'formation' with a new coherent logic.&#8221;

The next link is to the same document (more or less, it&#8217;s a different
version of the same unpublished manuscript from 2006-2007) but it is on the
main web site and I would recommend it for further exploration.

mini-version of the Encyclopedia is to be found at

than 10,000 pages.

] The High Road or Low Road to P2P?

Given the pace of on going events in the global economy, it is not
surprising that while I was preparing this piece on Michel, new information
caused me to look at a darker strain of p2p thought. In early June a blog
post by Michel

i.e.
<A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-high-road-towards-p2p-is-dying-prepare-yourself-for-the-low-road/2010/06/02">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-high-road-towards-p2p-is-dying-prepare-yourself-for-the-low-road/2010/06/02</A>

pointed me in the direction of John Robb, a thinker who has answers to
questions that have been profoundly troubling to me about what I regard as
an ongoing betrayal of his election campaign promises on the part of Barack
Obama.

For the past few years I have noted with concern the disappearance of public
interest and national interest from the vocabulary of acceptable political
discussion. Why have a nation state with a government whose legitimacy is
perceived in terms of whether or not it enables life liberty and the pursuit
of happiness on the part of its citizens? I have lived my life that this
promise is a serious part of what it means to be an American citizen. Robb
has a convincing and disturbing answer. Namely, that nation state is in the
process of vanishing. It has been subsumed on the one hand by the financial
interests of globalization and on the other hand by the local interests of
bands of guerrilla tribes.

On June 2, 2010, Michel wrote:

- &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of John Robb, but I must admit I initially thought he was
way too pessimistic. Indeed, faced with the 2008 meltdown, John predicted a
rapid rise of hollow states, which retain the form, but can no longer
function as we expect states to do. As I witness the self-destruction of the
Thai state, which refuses a social compromise and free elections to the
majority of its working and rural population, even as it is still in a
growth phase, and as I witness the attacks of extreme neo-liberalism on what
remains of the European welfare state (I&#8217;ve just been in Italy, where there
is endemic pre-scarcity, and which seems behind Thailand in many
infrastructural respects and is in the hands of a predatory faction of
capital), I&#8217;m now increasingly convinced that he was right, and I too
optimistic.&quot;

. . .

- I [have] posted two main scenarios. A scenario of deep meltdown and final
crisis, leading to resilient local communities, but also another &#8216;high road&#8217;
scenario with a substantial chance for a combination of enlightened policy
by Obama. (Indeed, how naive I was to compare him to Roosevelt instead of
the Herbert Hoover he turned out to be), I had hoped for popular
mobilization, and the interconnecting of new open infrastructures.

What seems to be happening is that mobilization indeed is increasingly
happening, and also the quite rapid spread of open and sharing
infrastructures, BUT, there is no longer anyone to talk to. The enlightened
part of the nation states either do not exist or are too weak, and the
global market forces are intent to break what remains of their independence,
and hence, what they can do and signify on behalf of their own people.
They&#8217;re is simply nobody there anymore, the system has exhausted its
capabilities to operate outside of the narrow interests of the predatory
financial class. Here is what Niall Ferguson has to say on the subject,
giving a historical context to sovereign defaults and how it has destroyed
empires in the past, in very rapid ways.


*1. The end of the high road to P2P*


So, without further ado, here is what John Robb is writing on the matter:

(This is no call for despair mind you, it means more urgency to the building
of the successor civilization!!)&#8221;

COOK Report: [in what follows I have taken Michel&#8217;s quotes and amplified
them with additional material from Robb.]

Robb: the current sovereign debt crisis is &#8220;another battle in a war for
dominance between &quot;our&quot; integrated, impersonal global economic system and
traditional nation-states. At issue is whether a nation-state serves the
interests of the governed or it serves the interests of a global economic
system?&#8221;

&#8220;Who's winning? The global economic system, of course. The 2008 financial
crisis, the first real battle of this war (as opposed to the early losses in
skirmishes in Russia, Argentina, the Balkans, etc.), generated a very
decisive outcome. It was a resounding defeat for nation-states. The current
crisis in the EU will almost certainly end with the same results.&#8217;

&#8216;When this war ends, and it won't be long, the global economic and financial
system will be the victor. Once that occurs, the nation-states of the West
will join those of the global south as hollow states: mere shells of states
that serve only to enforce the interests of the global economic system.
These new states, more market-states than nation-states, will offer citizens
a mere vestige of the public goods they offered historically. Incomes will
fall to developing world levels (made easy to due highly portable
productivity), and wealth will stratify. Regulatory protections will be
weak. Civil service pensions will be erased and corruption will reign.

The once dominant militaries of the West will be reduced to a small fraction
of their current size, and their focus will be on the maintenance of
internal control rather than on external threats. The clear and unambiguous
message to every citizen of the West will be:

You are on your own. You are in direct competition with everyone else in the
world, and your success or failure is something you alone control.&#8221;

&#8220;For those that think that this will bring about a surge of peaceful
economic vigor, you will be wrong. It will fragment society and lead to
perpetual stagnation/depression, endemic violence/ corruption, and squalor.
For absent any moral basis (a social compact), stability, or (widely shared)
prosperity: new sources of order will emerge to fill the gap left by the
hollowing out of the nation-state.

These new sources of order will be first seen in the rise of the criminal
entrepreneur, whether they be the suited corporate gangster or the gang
tattooed thug. For in the world of hollow states (without a morality that
limits behavior) and limitless connectivity to the global economic system,
these criminal entrepreneurs quickly become dominant, violently coercing or
corrupting everyone in the path to their enrichment.&#8221;

&#8220;As this occurs, you have a choice.

   - 1. You can stand alone and do nothing. Thereby suffering the predations
   of this new criminal

class.

   - 2. You can join them and prey on your former compatriots, enriching
   yourself in the process.


   - 3. Or finally, you can build something new. Resilient communities and
   independent economic

networks based on freedom, prosperity, and a new moral compact.&#8221;

COOK Report: Let&#8217;s take a deep breath and journey with Robb through the
decline of the nation state to the hollow state But first what then is a
hollow state?

Robb: &#8220;A hollow state is different from a failed state in that it continues
to exist on the international stage. It has all the standard edifices of
governance although most are heavily corrupted and in thrall to global
corporate/monied elites. It continues to deliver political goods (albeit to
a vastly diminished group, usually around the capital) and maintains a
military. Further, in sections of the country, there is an appearance of
normal life.

Or as Robb put it on January 20 2010 in a post he called: Brands and Hollow
Nation-States &quot;We have the best brand on earth: the Obama brand. Our
possibilities are endless.&quot;

Desiree Rogers, White House Brand Guru.

&#8220;The nation-state, as an organizational form that seized control of the
world from the starting gates at the treaties of Westphalia, is losing power
across the board -- due to the rise of a much larger, faster, complex, and
powerful global system. The result has been a hollowing out of the
nation-state through privatization, corruption, and outright abdication (of
responsibility). With each passing year, less of the historical nation-state
is left. A process accelerated by the financial demise caused by boondoggles
from foreign military adventures to propping up massive global subsystems
when they get into trouble.&#8221;

&#8220;Despite this trend, the nation-state isn't going away. It still plays a
role in the growing global ecosystem, and nothing has risen to displace it
(global ideological homogeneity of nation-state governance dictates this).
It will merely adapt to the evolving niche it is relegated to. So, what does
the nation-state look like in its residual and adapted form?&#8221;

&#8220;Naomi Klein has some excellent analysis of what it becomes. It's a very
good read, and if you disregard her dated nostalgia for populist movements
and progressive government reform -- that legacy thinking is utterly
useless, as a strategy for success, given the rise of a dominant and
sovereign global system that doesn't have any governing body to appeal to --
the article provides a very incisive analysis of how the nation-state
survives after tangible power is gone.&#8221;

&#8220;Simply, the nation-state becomes a brand. More specifically, it becomes a
lifestyle brand, or worse, a lifestyle brand centered on a single person.
All of its functions outside of the strategic communications (public
relations, information operations, etc.) required to support and extend it
are outsourced, auctioned off, or abdicated.&#8221;

&#8220;So where does that leave you as an individual or a family? You can buy into
that brand and get little except a name emblazoned on a t-shirt, since that
brand doesn't have the capability to really defend your interests or help
you succeed in a harsh/unstable global system. The other option is to build
something new. A new resilient tribe to provide you with a real, tangible
future that enables you to thrive.&#8217;


There is a lot more about John Robb pages 15 to 18.

We continue our excerpting:


Michel has a balanced evaluation of Robb. On June 20 he wrote: I'm not a
John Robb expert, having not read the book, but I follow his blog, though
with some delay, but I consider him, together with Jeff Vail, I consider him
a top thinker on p2p ...

What makes John Robb distinctive is 1) his emphasis on negative p2p
developments, the dark side if you like, i.e. p2p-democratization of
warfare, insurgent organization, and the means of destruction .... According
to him, combined with other developments, this leads to a fatal weakening of
the nation state. The meltdown for him is less a crisis of capitalism than
actually a victory of the global market forces over the nation state. The
result is hollow states, that keep the form, but are no longer able to carry
out the duties and functions of the state. So, when people discover that the
nation-state is no longer able to solve any of their fundamental issues,
they turn to more basic levels of identity and social organization, and they
can do this in progressive ways (open localization concerned with equity and
world governance), or in reactionary ways (restricted group identity
communalism). It&#8217;s pretty clear the tea party is the latter, while John
Robb, like us here at the P2P Foundation, are in the former. The key
distinction is where do you draw the line of concern (who is the in and out
group), and how you relate to the out group (solidarity vs. enmity).

Another distinction is the balance between optimism and pessimism and how to
factor in the possibility of progressive social forces. My own take is that
you can never discount new social movements emerging, and I hope to see at
some point, a merger of social mobilization, with constructive p2p
communities. I think John Robb totally discounts that form of collective
agency, hence he can only see the global market, nation states captured by
predatory factions, and in reaction, local resilient communities. It's
really like there is nothing in between collapse and resilience. I hope he
is wrong, is all I can say, and that a new progressive wave is still in the
realm of the possibilities. It all boils down to this: is this the final
stage of dislocation of the current global system, as John Robb asserts, or
do we still have a possibility of a new growth wave, even amongst the
serious problems developing?

But in any case, even if the latter were possible, we still have to go
through a deep period of dislocation to de-leverage the former
system-wave... and exactly because the global political elite fails to do
this (they are to weak vis a vis the global market forces and can't rely on
any strong social movements to counter-pressure them), we are in for a
prolonged period of chaos, like the thirties in Europe. Short term (say 15
years dislocation) or long term dislocation (think end of Roman Empire),
that is the question.

in any case, even if a positive Kondratieff wave was still possible, it
would very very soon collide with interlocking global crisis which would
make the continuation of capitalism unthinkable in a time frame of more than
50 years. Consequently the problem is, what will replace it, a reactionary
power structure of increased exploitation, in a global struggle for
dwindling resources amongst overpopulation, food and water and resource
depletion and climate change, with scattered pockets of resilient
communities ... or a new p2p system centered around open commons of
knowledge, code and designs, linked to relocalized and more distributed
property formats, with forms of global governance that protects the planet?&#8221;
