</I>&gt;<i> Michel Bauwens
</I>&gt;<i> 9th July 2010
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A talk by *Iqbal Quadir* , &#8220;Technology Empowers the Poorest&#8221;, summarized&lt;<A HREF="http://longnow.org/seminars/02008/may/21/technology-empowers-the-poorest/">http://longnow.org/seminars/02008/may/21/technology-empowers-the-poorest/</A>&gt;by Kevin Kelly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;In Quadir&#8217;s view, it&#8217;s not that centralization per se creates poverty.
</I>&gt;<i> Poverty is the natural beginning state of all societies, east or west.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather, *decentralization is the engine which removes poverty and brings
</I>&gt;<i> wealth. To the degree that infrastructure, education, and trade can be
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized, wealth will rise in proportion. To the degree that
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure, education and trade are centralized, poverty will remain*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whereas many of us in the west, particularly the digital west, agree with
</I>&gt;<i> this intuitively, we act contrary to this observation when we give
</I>&gt;<i> large-scale aid to poor countries. As Quadir&#8217;s colleague William Easterly
</I>&gt;<i> argues in his book The Elusive Quest for Growth, the billions and billions
</I>&gt;<i> of dollars spent on aid for developing countries has not only *not* helped,
</I>&gt;<i> it has set them back decades. Aid, as we know it, kills development. This
</I>&gt;<i> harm occurs because almost all previous aid has funneled through a central
</I>&gt;<i> government or semi-governmental organizations and that official route
</I>&gt;<i> tightens centrality. Even if the governments were saintly, and they are
</I>&gt;<i> definitely not, the scale of money flowing through these centralizing nodes
</I>&gt;<i> prohibits the distribution of resources, infrastructure, trade, and
</I>&gt;<i> education. The more aid that arrives, the less development can actually
</I>&gt;<i> happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Technology is the escape from this quandary. Quadir came to see that
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;technologies that connect&#8221; could liberate productivity. He matched his
</I>&gt;<i> experience in Bangladesh as a 13-year-old boy having to walk 10 kilometers
</I>&gt;<i> to get medicine, only to find out the medicine man he sought was not home,
</I>&gt;<i> and then walking back empty handed, having wasted a day &#8212; all because there
</I>&gt;<i> was no connection between his home and the pharmacist. Many years later in
</I>&gt;<i> New York he wasted a day at work when there was no electricity to run phones
</I>&gt;<i> or computers. Productivity required connectivity. If connectivity could be
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized then it would lead to increased wealth.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quadir settled on the cell phone as a way to decentralized connectivity. In
</I>&gt;<i> the early 1990s cell phones were big, dumb, and very expensive. Calls were
</I>&gt;<i> $3 per minute. Only the rich could afford them. But he wanted the poorest
</I>&gt;<i> people in the world to get them. How would this be possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, he believed in Moore&#8217;s Law: that the phones would decrease in price
</I>&gt;<i> and increase in power every year. That seemed inevitable to him. He said he
</I>&gt;<i> could see &#8220;micro-chips marching toward the poor.&#8221; He was right about that.
</I>&gt;<i> Second, he piggybacked his hopes on a remarkable invention of another
</I>&gt;<i> Bangladeshi, Mohammad Yunus, who developed micro-financing (and later won a
</I>&gt;<i> Nobel prize for this invention). In Yunus&#8217; scheme a woman who owned
</I>&gt;<i> virtually nothing could get a loan of $200 to purchase a cow. She would then
</I>&gt;<i> sell the surplus milk of the cow to pay back the loan, earn both milk and an
</I>&gt;<i> income for her family, and maybe buy another cow. Ordinarily, no bank would
</I>&gt;<i> have lent her this trifling amount because she had no collateral, no
</I>&gt;<i> education, and the costs of overseeing such a small loan with small gains,
</I>&gt;<i> would have been prohibitive. Grameen Bank, Yunus&#8217; creation, discovered that
</I>&gt;<i> these illiterate peasants were actually more likely to repay these small
</I>&gt;<i> loans, and were very happy to pay good interest rates, and so that in
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate, these micro-loans were more profitable than loaning to large
</I>&gt;<i> industrial players.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quadir proceeded to ask, what if the women could rent a cell phone instead
</I>&gt;<i> of a cow? Grameen Bank could make a micro-loan to the poor for the purchase
</I>&gt;<i> a cell phone, which they then could sell/rent minutes to the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> village. The enterprising phone-renter would benefit and more importantly,
</I>&gt;<i> the entire village would benefit from the connectivity. It did not really
</I>&gt;<i> matter if the minutes were expensive, because when you have no connection,
</I>&gt;<i> you are willing to pay dearly for it. Quadir started off his GrameenPhone
</I>&gt;<i> with 5 cell towers, and eventually GrameenPhone erected 5,000 towers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 1993 when Quadir began, Bangladesh had one of the lowest penetrations of
</I>&gt;<i> telephones on the planet &#8212; only one phone for every 500 people. GrameenPhone
</I>&gt;<i> project unleashed 25 million phones. Today there are 100 times as many
</I>&gt;<i> phones, or one per 5 people. Just as Quadir had envisioned, this
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized connectivity has increased productivity. Without connectivity
</I>&gt;<i> people waste a lot more time on economic errands. With cell connectivity
</I>&gt;<i> farmers maximize their profits by getting real-time prices at distant
</I>&gt;<i> markets; shepherds can call a vet, or order medicine. One study concluded
</I>&gt;<i> that the total lifetime cost of an additional phone (including the cell
</I>&gt;<i> tower and switching gear) was about $2,000, but that each phone enabled
</I>&gt;<i> $50,000 of increased productivity. And surprisingly, the poorer the country
</I>&gt;<i> to begin with, the greater the increase in wealth from connectivity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of myths cloud the good intentions of developmental aid, Quadir says.
</I>&gt;<i> Myths such as: poor countries have no resources, or that the poor don&#8217;t have
</I>&gt;<i> discretionary spending, or aren&#8217;t concerned with brands,or aren&#8217;t good
</I>&gt;<i> credit risks, and so on. All these assumptions have been proven untrue over
</I>&gt;<i> and over again, and especially so with GrameenPhone. The chief myth it
</I>&gt;<i> dispelled was that government needs to subsidize technological development,
</I>&gt;<i> when in fact there is good money to be made enabling the productivity of the
</I>&gt;<i> poor. As Quadir says, &#8220;You don&#8217;t make money on the poor, but with the poor.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> At dinner I asked Iqbal what he would have done differently with
</I>&gt;<i> GrameenPhone. He replied, &#8220;Kept more shares.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quadir is now searching for other technologies to decentralize, and thereby
</I>&gt;<i> become a tool to erase poverty. He is director of the Legatum Center for
</I>&gt;<i> Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT, which has been funded with $50
</I>&gt;<i> million. He is investigating whether energy can also be dethroned from its
</I>&gt;<i> current mode of extremely centralized generation. Only 10% of the
</I>&gt;<i> electricity produced at its source remains at the end of the wires as they
</I>&gt;<i> reach homes and factories. Perhaps there are ways to decentralize its
</I>&gt;<i> generation, which would trigger connections at the local level, and in his
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, elevate wealth and democracy. If it worked, decentralized energy
</I>&gt;<i> might also work in rich countries, increasing wealth and democracy in our
</I>&gt;<i> part of the world as well.&#8221;
