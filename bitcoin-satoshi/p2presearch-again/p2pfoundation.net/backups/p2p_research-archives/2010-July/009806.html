Hi Michel, don't have much time to get into this at the moment, but I
agree that I am able to make my arguments more precisely now, and our many
discussions and debates over the years have certainly helped, so thanks.


Best,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --- excerpt --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imaging that a &#8220;better&#8221; copyright system or a &#8220;freer&#8221; Internet could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the present system of economic relations is to misplace the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deterministic factors. The intrinsic truth in arguments against
</I>copyright
&gt;&gt;<i> and the clear technical superiority of distributed technologies over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centralized ones have not been the deciding factors in the ultimate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development of our intellectual property system or our global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communications infrastructure, both of which have gotten more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consolidated,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regulated and restrictive. The determining factor is, as always, the
</I>fact
&gt;&gt;<i> that those whose interests are served by restricting freedom have more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wealth with which to relentlessly push toward their ends then is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to resist them. The economic reasons for this are well understood, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numerically small class of Capitalists are the beneficiaries of an
</I>unfair
&gt;&gt;<i> distribution of productive assets that allows then them to capture the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wealth produced by the masses of property-less workers. If we want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a say in the way copyright works (or to abolish it) or to influence the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communication networks are operated, or if we want to make any social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reforms whatsoever, we must start by preventing property owners from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turning our productivity into their accumulated wealth. The wealth they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to endorse restrictions on our freedoms is the wealth they have taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us. Without us they would have no source of wealth, even the great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accumulated wealth from centuries of exploitation can not ultimately
</I>save
&gt;&gt;<i> them if the you are unable to continue to capture current wealth. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the future is far greater than the value of the past. Our ideas
</I>about
&gt;&gt;<i> intellectual property and network topology are ultimately no threat to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Capitalism, who can always co-opt, sabotage or simply ignore them. It
</I>is
&gt;&gt;<i> the new ways of working together and sharing that are emerging that
</I>have
&gt;&gt;<i> the potential to threaten the capitalist order and bring about a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Often discussions of the productive relations in free software projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia attempt to bottle up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commons-based production and trap it within the sphere of &#8220;immaterial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production,&#8221; restricting it exclusively to the domain where it can not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affect wealth distribution and thereby play a role in class conflict.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yochai Benkler, Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> School, coined the term &#8220;Peer production&#8221; to describe the way free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software, Wikipedia articles and similar works are produced. Benkler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his analysis to the so-called &#8220;Networked Information Economy.&#8221; The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> novelty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Peer Production as understood by Benkler and many others is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property in the commons is entirely non-rivalrous property:
</I>Intellectual
&gt;&gt;<i> property and network transferable or accessible resources. Property
</I>with
&gt;&gt;<i> virtually no reproduction costs. Also, another distinguishing feature
</I>of
&gt;&gt;<i> this limited concept of Peer Production is that the producers in these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples do not receiver enumeration for what they have produced since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their products are available for free, for example users of free
</I>software
&gt;&gt;<i> do not compensate the original developers. Thus they claim that Peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Production is &#8220;Non-reciprocal.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is no denying that Benkler&#8217;s wealthy network has a lot to offer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value of this information commons to its users is fantastic, as evident
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the millions who employ Free Software, Wikipedia, on-line
</I>communications
&gt;&gt;<i> and social networking tools, etc. However, if commons-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peer-production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is limited exclusively to a commons made of digital property with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no reproduction costs, how can the use-value produced be translated
</I>into
&gt;&gt;<i> exchange-value? Where is the money to pay for the production of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valuable things? Something with no reproduction costs can have no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange-value in a context of free exchange, anybody who wants a copy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obtain one from anybody that has one. But if what they produce has no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange-value, how can the peer producers be able to acquire the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs for their own subsistence?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The wealthy network exists within a context of a poor planet. The
</I>source
&gt;&gt;<i> of the problem of poverty does not dwell in a lack of culture or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information but in the direct exploitation of the producing class by
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> property-owning classes. The source of poverty is not reproduction
</I>costs
&gt;&gt;<i> but rather extracted economic rents, surplus value captured by way of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forcing producers to accept less than the full product of their labour
</I>as
&gt;&gt;<i> their wage by denying them independent access to the means of
</I>production.
&gt;&gt;<i> So long as commons-based peer-production is applied narrowly to only an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information commons while the capitalist mode of production still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dominates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the production of material wealth, owners of material property will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to capture the marginal wealth created as a result of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> productivity of the information commons. Whatever exchange value is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> derived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the information commons will always be captured by owners of real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property, which lies outside the commons. For Peer Production to have
</I>any
&gt;&gt;<i> effect on general material wealth it has to operate within the context
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overall system of goods and services, where the physical means of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production and the virtual means of production are both available in
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> commons for peer production. By establishing the idea of commons-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peer-production in the context of an information-only commons, Benkler
</I>is
&gt;&gt;<i> creating a trap, ensuring the value created in the peer economy is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriated by property privilege. We have found Benkler standing on
</I>his
&gt;&gt;<i> head, and we will need to redefine Peer Production to put his head
</I>above
&gt;&gt;<i> his feet again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is not the &#8220;production&#8221; in &#8220;immaterial, non-reciprocal&#8221; production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is immaterial. The computers, the networks and the developers and their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> places of work and residence are all very much material and all require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material upkeep. What is immaterial is the distribution. Digitized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information, source code or cultural works, can multiply and zip across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global networks in fractions of a second, yet production remains a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material affair. If Peer Production can only produce immaterial good,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as software, and the producers get nothing in return for such
</I>production,
&gt;&gt;<i> if Peer Production is &#8220;immaterial, non-reciprocal&#8221; production, then
</I>this
&gt;&gt;<i> form of &#8220;production&#8221; has no right to be called a mode of production at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First and foremost any mode of production must account for it&#8217;s
</I>material
&gt;&gt;<i> inputs or else vanish, these inputs must include the subsistence costs
</I>of
&gt;&gt;<i> it&#8217;s labour contributors, to at minimum &#8220;enable the labourer&#8217;s, one
</I>with
&gt;&gt;<i> another, to subsist and to perpetuate their race&#8221; in the words of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ricardo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;Immaterial, Non-reciprocal&#8221; production can not do so, since to produce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> free software, free culture or free soup the producers must draw their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsistence from some other source, and therefore &#8220;immaterial,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-reciprocal&#8221; production is not a form of production at all, only a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> special case of distribution within another form of production.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;Immaterial, Non-reciprocal&#8221; production is no more a mode of production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a charity soup kitchen or socialized medicine. It is simply a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> super-structural phenomenon which has another mode of production as its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rather than placing emphasis on the immaterial distribution of what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produced by current examples of Peer Production, we may note instead
</I>that
&gt;&gt;<i> such production is characterized by independent producers employing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common stock of productive assets. This view of Peer Production is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> categorically limited to immaterial goods. Understood this way, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Peer Production, where a network of peers apply their labour to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stock for mutual and individual benefit, certainly resonates with
</I>age-old
&gt;&gt;<i> proposed socialist modes of production where a class-less community of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workers(&#8220;peers&#8221;) produce collaboratively within a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property-less(&#8220;commons-based&#8221;) society. Unlike the &#8220;immaterial,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-reciprocal&#8221; definition this formulation can account for its
</I>material
&gt;&gt;<i> inputs, its labour specialization, its means of capital formation, etc,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also better describes the productive basis of free software as well as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closely relates to the topology of peer networks from which the term is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> derived. Further, this formulation also is better rooted in history, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> describes historical examples of commons-based production such as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pastoral commons, cottage agriculture and cottage industry as well. As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution of productive assets is so much at the root of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inequality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of wealth and power that perpetuates exploitive systems, a mode of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production where productive assets are held in common is clearly a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially revolutionary one if it could take root. However if the
</I>form
&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production can be contained to the immaterial, if it can be categorized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immaterial by definition, then it&#8217;s producers can not capture any of
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> value they create, and thus Harvard Law Professors strive to keep it so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined. However if we can implement ways of independently sharing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common-stock of material assets and thereby expand the scope of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commons
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to include material as well as immaterial goods, then direct producers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> employ these assets in their production can retain a greater portion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their product.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Peer production is distinct from other modes of production. Worker&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independently employing a common-stock of productive assets is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode, distinct from both capitalist and collectivist modes. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capitalist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode of production is exploitive by nature, its fundamental logic is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capture surplus value from labour by denying independent access to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means of production. However, collectivist modes can also be
</I>exploitive.
&gt;&gt;<i> For instance in Co-operative production, in which producers
</I>collectively
&gt;&gt;<i> employ jointly owned productive assets, the distribution of productive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assets is likely to be unfair among different co-operatives, allowing
</I>one
&gt;&gt;<i> to exploit the other. Larger scale collectivist forms, such as
</I>Socialist
&gt;&gt;<i> states or very big diversified co-operatives can be said to eliminate
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> sort of exploitation that can occur between co-operatives, however, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expanding coordination layers needed to manage these large
</I>organizations
&gt;&gt;<i> give rise to a coordinator class, anew class consisting of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> techno-administrative elite that has proven in historical examples to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the capacity to be just as parasitic and stifling to workers as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Capitalist class. However the community of Peer producers can grow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developing layers of co-ordination because they are self-organizing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produce independently, and as such they do not need any layers of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> co-ordination other than that what is needed to provision the common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of productive assets, thus co-ordination is limited to allocation of
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> common stock among those who wish to employ it. It is no surprise then,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that this sort production has appeared and flourished where the common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stock is immaterial property, the low reproduction costs eliminate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allocation concerns. Thus what is needed for Peer production to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorporate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material goods into the common-stock is a system for the allocation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material assets among the independent peers which imposes only a
</I>minimal
&gt;&gt;<i> co-ordination burden. Venture Communism is such a way.
