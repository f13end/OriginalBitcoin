<PRE>Life is a strange standard.  Why not go for functionality?

If an old person can sit on a phone and talk to a computer that it cannot
distinguish from a companion, then who is on the other side of the phone?  A
lie?  A life?  Would anyone care?  As computer games get more sophisticated,
those needing &quot;real&quot; outlets is probably going to drop.  Reality is
fun...ideal, but simulation can be great fun too and better and better
simulations go a long way.

Regardless, building a body is getting close.  Building rationalizing
machines is also seemingly on the feasible horizon.  So, artificial flowers
seems a rather strange retort to what is going on.  The moral, social and
political questions are far more interesting than the nihilism of...not
really life.

&gt;<i> How to Manufacture the Notion of Synthetic Life
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently participated in a conference on synthetic biology (the
</I>&gt;<i> discipline where one attempts to synthesize, in part or in whole, new
</I>&gt;<i> organisms) at the Hastings Center in the lower Hudson Valley of New York.
</I>&gt;<i> A rather minor exchange at the very end of the conference has been working
</I>&gt;<i> on me ever since.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The question of the value of artificial flowers (of the conventional
</I>&gt;<i> sort) had come up, and after a good deal of conversation, I remarked, &quot;By
</I>&gt;<i> the way, I'd like to clarify a simple point.  There has never been an
</I>&gt;<i> artificial plant that was even vaguely similar to a real one&quot;.  This
</I>&gt;<i> produced a roomful of blank looks, puzzled expressions, and raised
</I>&gt;<i> eyebrows -- symptoms, I would submit, of the difficulty we have in
</I>&gt;<i> understanding life today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I went on to explain: a plant is living.  It expresses itself into the
</I>&gt;<i> world as *movement*.  It grows from seed to leaf to flower to fruit to
</I>&gt;<i> seed.  (I ought, at this point, to have mimicked the opening of a flower
</I>&gt;<i> with my arms.)  The plant *gestures* its existence; this gesturing, not
</I>&gt;<i> some frozen form or substance, is what it *is*.  No artificial plant
</I>&gt;<i> duplicates this reality in any meaningful way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   As I said, the point has been working on me.  It brought to mind a talk
</I>&gt;<i> I heard ten or fifteen years ago by one of our then-local doctors, Philip
</I>&gt;<i> Incao.  He asked those of us in the audience to close our eyes and take a
</I>&gt;<i> minute to imagine the human circulatory system.  And, yes, we all imagined
</I>&gt;<i> *things* -- the heart, arteries, veins, red blood cells, and so on.  The
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the circulatory system is a system of movement -- that it is
</I>&gt;<i> most essentially a *doing* -- was hardly uppermost in our minds.  Dr.
</I>&gt;<i> Incao went on to cite a remark by Novalis: the body is a formed stream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   My colleague, Craig Holdrege, once illustrated this by explaining how
</I>&gt;<i> the spiraling fibers of the heart muscle that help to direct the blood in
</I>&gt;<i> its flow are themselves a congealed image of the swirling vortex of blood
</I>&gt;<i> within.  This kind of mutuality holds even for the heart's basic
</I>&gt;<i> structural divisions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Before the heart has developed walls (septa) separating the four
</I>&gt;<i>     chambers from each other, the blood already flows in two distinct
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;currents&quot; through the heart.  The [currents] flowing through the
</I>&gt;<i>     right and left sides of the heart do not mix, but stream and loop by
</I>&gt;<i>     each other, just as two currents in a body of water.  In the &quot;still
</I>&gt;<i>     water zone&quot; between the two currents, the septum dividing the two
</I>&gt;<i>     chambers forms.  Thus the movement of the blood gives the parameters
</I>&gt;<i>     for the inner differentiation of the heart, just as the looping heart
</I>&gt;<i>     redirects the flow of blood.  (*The Dynamic Heart and Circulation*,
</I>&gt;<i>     edited by Craig Holdrege.  Fair Oaks CA: AWSNA, 2002, p. 12)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Our inherited mode of thought today tells us that things produce
</I>&gt;<i> movement.  The more fundamental reality is just the opposite: particular
</I>&gt;<i> things crystallize out of the right sort of movement.  The tendency to
</I>&gt;<i> materialize and, indeed, mechanize life in our imaginations, when
</I>&gt;<i> unchecked, pretty much determines our philosophical conclusions about life
</I>&gt;<i> before we ever get a conversation going on the subject.  This is how we
</I>&gt;<i> manufacture the notion of synthetic life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   It happens that in my own talk at the Hastings Center I had quoted the
</I>&gt;<i> twentieth-century cell biologist, Paul Weiss, to the effect that &quot;Life is
</I>&gt;<i> a dynamic *process*.  Logically, the elements of a process can be only
</I>&gt;<i> elementary *processes*, and not elementary *particles* or any other static
</I>&gt;<i> units&quot;.  In a 1963 paper, Weiss wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Stable structures that are demonstrable in the living cell, other
</I>&gt;<i>     than chromosomes, have mostly turned out to be secondary derivatives,
</I>&gt;<i>     rather than primary carriers, of cellular organization . . . [There
</I>&gt;<i>     is] such incessant reshuffling of the cell content that even the
</I>&gt;<i>     thought that at last the supramolecular units (particulates) might be
</I>&gt;<i>     linked into a stable framework can be safely dismissed . . . cell
</I>&gt;<i>     contour, intracellular fiber systems, and granules of various
</I>&gt;<i>     descriptions change their configurations and positions continuously,
</I>&gt;<i>     thus ruling out the presence, or at any rate, the relevance, of a
</I>&gt;<i>     consistent three-dimensional cytoskeleton . . . Yet despite the
</I>&gt;<i>     absence of an orderly static frame, the various activities of all
</I>&gt;<i>     parts remain coordinated in the maintenance of a standard pattern of
</I>&gt;<i>     order in any given cell.  It is an order of relations rather than of
</I>&gt;<i>     fixed positions.  (&quot;The Cell as Unit&quot;, *Journal of Theoretical
</I>&gt;<i>     Biology* vol. 5, 1963, pp. 389-97)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   There are countless molecular processes going on in the cell and
</I>&gt;<i> organism as a whole, continuing through time, and Weiss points out that
</I>&gt;<i> these are interlocking processes, like &quot;civic activities in a community&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Every stage of every process must be in a certain proper correspondence
</I>&gt;<i> with every stage of every other process.  The plant's movement, in other
</I>&gt;<i> words, is compounded of countless submovements, and these are harmonized
</I>&gt;<i> in the distinctive gesturing of the plant as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I find it interesting to compare this line of thought with the notions
</I>&gt;<i> of someone like AI guru, Ray Kurzweil.  After all, artificial intelligence
</I>&gt;<i> researchers and synthetic biology researchers share much of the same
</I>&gt;<i> general naivete about life.  In *The Age of Spiritual Machines* Kurzweil
</I>&gt;<i> talks about &quot;reverse engineering&quot; the brain by analyzing it, thin slice by
</I>&gt;<i> thin slice, and then &quot;implementing&quot; its neurons and their supposed inputs
</I>&gt;<i> and outputs in a computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Suppose we could do far better than that.  Suppose we didn't have to be
</I>&gt;<i> content with merely abstracting a few features from brains -- features
</I>&gt;<i> that a computer engineer such as Kurzweil (or anyone else) happens to
</I>&gt;<i> think, with rather blatant arbitrariness, are the few that really count.
</I>&gt;<i> (Actually, there is not a single feature of the embodied brain that is
</I>&gt;<i> faithfully captured in any computer model.  But that is a point for
</I>&gt;<i> another time.) Assume instead that we could assemble precise replicas of
</I>&gt;<i> those brain slices, atom by atom, successively adding each slice to the
</I>&gt;<i> previous ones.  Would we then have produced a living brain by artificial
</I>&gt;<i> means?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The question is rather like asking whether an artificial flower is a
</I>&gt;<i> living flower.  It is to have forgotten almost everything about the
</I>&gt;<i> reality of the brain.  What has happened to the *movement*?  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> as we were assembling those slices, how were the individual cells being
</I>&gt;<i> nourished?  How were the intercellular fluids and blood circulating among
</I>&gt;<i> them?  How were any living processes actually occurring in the cells --
</I>&gt;<i> the essential chemical signaling that takes place within and between
</I>&gt;<i> cells, enabling them to retain a living connection to each other; the
</I>&gt;<i> intricately coordinated replication of DNA; the entire elaborate process
</I>&gt;<i> of regulation of gene expression; cell division, bringing into movement as
</I>&gt;<i> it does *everything* in the cell . . . ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   It's one thing to assemble many pieces of a complex puzzle, and quite
</I>&gt;<i> another to establish a harmonious coordination among a complex set of
</I>&gt;<i> interweaving processes -- a coordination that would require the setting in
</I>&gt;<i> motion, at a particular instant, of every one of the countless elements of
</I>&gt;<i> the cell in exactly the right relation to all the other dynamic processes.
</I>&gt;<i> And the coordination would have to be so calculated that the thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> ongoing, continually interpenetrating processes would be held together as
</I>&gt;<i> a single, coherent whole -- held together through all the unforeseeable
</I>&gt;<i> disturbances and environmental encounters differentially affecting all
</I>&gt;<i> those interrelated processes as the synthetic organism traverses its path
</I>&gt;<i> through life.  I see little evidence that the &quot;synbio&quot; proponents have
</I>&gt;<i> much appreciation of the real nature of their task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The tendency, I think, is to assume that you need only put the right
</I>&gt;<i> set of puzzle pieces together, and somehow the processes will
</I>&gt;<i> automatically start up and proceed as they ought.  They will &quot;emerge&quot;, as
</I>&gt;<i> the jargon goes, indicating a kind of mystical potential in the puzzle
</I>&gt;<i> pieces.  This is why a number of commentators have recognized in the
</I>&gt;<i> supposedly all-explaining DNA of modern biology something like an
</I>&gt;<i> animistic totem or materialized entelechy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Remove this kind of materialized magic, and what would you actually
</I>&gt;<i> have after assembling the last molecules of your artificial brain?  The
</I>&gt;<i> answer is easy: an object perfectly fitted for display in Madame Tussaud's
</I>&gt;<i> wax museum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   You may think that such a thought experiment is ridiculously
</I>&gt;<i> simplistic.  I agree.  But thought experiments just like this one have
</I>&gt;<i> been common for decades in fields such as cognitive science.  You can be
</I>&gt;<i> sure that proponents of today's &quot;synthetic biology&quot; will have a penchant
</I>&gt;<i> for similar mental excursions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   At the Hastings conference there were in fact various references to the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of assembling a living, single-celled organism from scratch,
</I>&gt;<i> molecule by molecule -- an organism that was &quot;precisely identical&quot; to some
</I>&gt;<i> already living organism.  You'll note what's going on here.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;precisely identical&quot; idea comes from the image of an organism already
</I>&gt;<i> murdered in the imagination, just like the artificial plant that is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;indistinguishable&quot; from a real one.  The life was removed from the image
</I>&gt;<i> in advance, and so, of course, the artificial product becomes very
</I>&gt;<i> persuasive as a replica of the real one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   It was evident that a number of the participants (the group was quite
</I>&gt;<i> diverse) simply took for granted the realistic prospects for such an
</I>&gt;<i> artificial construction.  On my part, I do not even know what could be
</I>&gt;<i> meant by constructing an artificial cell &quot;precisely identical&quot; to a real
</I>&gt;<i> one.  The real cell, after all, is never at two different moments
</I>&gt;<i> identical to *itself*, let alone to another cell.  It's as much a gesture
</I>&gt;<i> as a thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   It's not only that life is movement.  Equally important is the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that each kind of life displays a qualitatively distinct sort of movement.
</I>&gt;<i> When we bother to observe a real organism, we find that its gesturing is
</I>&gt;<i> recognizably different from that of other species.  An oak tree does not
</I>&gt;<i> at all have the same way of being as a weeping willow, nor is an amoeba's
</I>&gt;<i> movement (whether at the level of the whole organism or of molecular
</I>&gt;<i> process) choreographed in the style of a paramecium's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If and when I hear synthetic biologists discussing among themselves how
</I>&gt;<i> they will reproduce such a unique gesturing -- a gesturing they must
</I>&gt;<i> carefully and deliberately and knowledgeably compound out of the
</I>&gt;<i> innumerable molecular activities proceeding simultaneously and
</I>&gt;<i> interdependently in the cell -- all in order to produce from scratch a
</I>&gt;<i> particular sort of organism with a particular sort of recognizable
</I>&gt;<i> character, then I will believe they have begun to glimpse a problem that
</I>&gt;<i> might just conceivably define a synthetic discipline of life.  Otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> we're left with little more than the crude and mostly ignorant,
</I>&gt;<i> trial-and-error manipulation of already living things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The work in synthetic biology as we have it today does in fact rely
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly upon already living things.  A synthetic construct is inserted
</I>&gt;<i> into a living organism, and the organism then takes it up (if the
</I>&gt;<i> experiment is successful) and incorporates it into its own being in its
</I>&gt;<i> own manner.  If you want to know how this actually plays out in reality --
</I>&gt;<i> how the organism &quot;does its own thing&quot; with such foreign materials, often
</I>&gt;<i> in radically unexpected ways -- then check out the website, nontarget.org.
</I>&gt;<i> No one who fairly reviews that website can come away thinking we have a
</I>&gt;<i> *science* of synthetic biology, as opposed to a technologically
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated discipline of tinkering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In sum, the imagination at work in synthetic biology is grounded (often
</I>&gt;<i> without acknowledgment of the fact) in the world of living organisms --
</I>&gt;<i> organisms that are continually taken for granted, rarely observed as the
</I>&gt;<i> living, gesturing creatures they are, and then casually employed as a
</I>&gt;<i> means to assimilate and enliven artificial constructs.  The result is
</I>&gt;<i> viewed as a triumph of clever artifice, which it doubtless is.  But this
</I>&gt;<i> is no reason to lose sight of the creative contribution of the organism
</I>&gt;<i> itself.  Through its living *activity* it proves wonderfully capable of
</I>&gt;<i> meeting the contents of its environment -- internal or external, natural
</I>&gt;<i> or artificially constructed -- and drawing them up into its own life.
