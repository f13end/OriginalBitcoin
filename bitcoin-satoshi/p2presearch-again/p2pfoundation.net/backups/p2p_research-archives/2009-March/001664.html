</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Russia's internet is increasingly being used by the state to consolidate
</I>&gt;<i> its power, says Floriana Fossato.  Do Russian users want to use this tool to
</I>&gt;<i> mobilise activism?  Or is this just Western wishfulness?
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I attend international conferences and seminars on the Russian segment
</I>&gt;<i> of the Internet I am struck by the disparity between European and American
</I>&gt;<i> research fields of choice and those of their Russian counterparts. My
</I>&gt;<i> discussions with active practitioners or researchers on the Russian Internet
</I>&gt;<i> scene confirm that they share this impression. What gives rise to this
</I>&gt;<i> disparity?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A number of American researchers and their colleagues in Europe and
</I>&gt;<i> English-speaking countries around the world are keenly interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> Russian networked public sphere. They are inspired by the belief that modern
</I>&gt;<i> communications can support press freedom and establish new bonds of
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation between people. They hope it could lead to the creation of
</I>&gt;<i> grassroots movements and the mobilisation of broad and diverse offline
</I>&gt;<i> groups into civil and politicalaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Russian colleagues admit they are often frustrated by this reading and
</I>&gt;<i> regard it, only half jokingly, as an &quot;obsession&quot; with politics.They regard
</I>&gt;<i> this view of online engagement as at best na&#239;ve and/or narrow, preventing
</I>&gt;<i> serious analyses of more subtle social and cultural developments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The desire to examine the political and participatory aspects of RuNet is
</I>&gt;<i> often considered a by-productof the dominant American and/or British
</I>&gt;<i> attitude.  This aims to impose on the study of all things Russian a biased
</I>&gt;<i> approach, one that has little to do with Russia's real and diverse
</I>&gt;<i> developments and mainly leads to judgmental and confrontational conclusions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Focus of Russian interest
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last few years Russian researchers and internet experts have been
</I>&gt;<i> keen to focus on two issues.  Firstly, the quantitative aspects ofinternet
</I>&gt;<i> penetration, understandable in the light of the recent Russian Internet boom
</I>&gt;<i> that has generated significant business growth, enabling smart practitioners
</I>&gt;<i> to become successful entrepreneurs.  Secondly, on the opposite side of the
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum, specialised issues concerning literature and the cultural
</I>&gt;<i> discourse on the Web, following the celebrated Russian cultural and
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual tradition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, there is no comprehensive assessment of content available
</I>&gt;<i> in the Russian segment of the internet, including an analysis of online
</I>&gt;<i> civic and political engagement. In conversations with Russian internet
</I>&gt;<i> practitioners and research colleagues I sometimes have the feeling that many
</I>&gt;<i> are unwilling to look at the &quot;big picture&quot;and to tackle political issues
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to their own country's future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time the Russian practitioners who are actually interested and
</I>&gt;<i> personally engaged in the life of civil movements in the Russian blogosphere
</I>&gt;<i> seem rather over-optimistic as to the real -as opposed to virtual- outcome
</I>&gt;<i> of RuNet's potential for social-networking initiatives at grassroots level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In October 2008 an international conference was held at the Harriman
</I>&gt;<i> Institute at Columbia University. Internet expert and respected practitioner
</I>&gt;<i> Sergei Kuznetsov spoke at length about the value of RuNet initiatives and
</I>&gt;<i> projects that have produced excellent engagement results online.  While
</I>&gt;<i> sharing Kuznetsov's enthusiasm to a large extent, I and other participants
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out that only a tiny number of initiatives with a potentially
</I>&gt;<i> political angle could be considered consistent or successful in the offline
</I>&gt;<i> world and that an accurate assessment would be most valuable.  Kuznetsov is
</I>&gt;<i> personally engaged in a number of worthy charity and cultural initiatives,
</I>&gt;<i> alongside his principal online content-producing entrepreneurial activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another conference participant, Olessia Koltsova, from the St Petersburg
</I>&gt;<i> Higher School of Economics, presented her research on the online and offline
</I>&gt;<i> activity surrounding last year's attempts to prevent the closing of the European
</I>&gt;<i> University&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_University_at_St_Petersburg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_University_at_St_Petersburg</A>&gt;in St. Petersburg. Koltsova's conclusion was that the online activism of
</I>&gt;<i> students, scholars and supporters of this university, which is highly
</I>&gt;<i> respected in Russia and abroad, had indeed been very significant and
</I>&gt;<i> visible.  She said, however, that the total lack of political transparency
</I>&gt;<i> made it impossible to assess the importance of online activism in the
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making process that eventually spared the university.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this article I want to offer my reading of the cultural and sociological
</I>&gt;<i> background that I take into consideration when I examine Russian online
</I>&gt;<i> activity. I will base my argument on the insightful points of view of
</I>&gt;<i> several Russian scholars and also on the results of a recent research &lt;<A HREF="http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/the-web-that-failed.html">http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/the-web-that-failed.html</A>&gt;on
</I>&gt;<i> the political influence and practice of the Russian Internet, which I
</I>&gt;<i> conducted with other colleagues for the Reuters Institute for the Study of
</I>&gt;<i> Journalism at Oxford University.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Alternative SocialUniverse
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As part of the research project I interviewed sociologist Boris Dubin.  He
</I>&gt;<i> argued that the hopes of those who expect internet civil society activities
</I>&gt;<i> in Russia to increase quickly and have a significant impact on the offline
</I>&gt;<i> world are naive. Since the internet is essentially a horizontal
</I>&gt;<i> communication network, he maintained, the creation of ideas that could
</I>&gt;<i> successfully translate into offline activity and mobilisation would require
</I>&gt;<i> a corresponding vertical network of existing institutions (whose functions
</I>&gt;<i> are sometimes obstructed, but whose existence is nonetheless respected by
</I>&gt;<i> society and by the political leadership).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discussion of the importance of institutions is not new, and remains
</I>&gt;<i> one of the most important keys to understanding a situation that seems to
</I>&gt;<i> develop mainly by endlessly reproducing itself. One very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> contribution in this respect is that of Irina Prokhorova, the very able
</I>&gt;<i> editor of the New Literary Review, who offers an explanation accurately
</I>&gt;<i> reflecting the view of most Russian academic and intellectual circles in her
</I>&gt;<i> paper &quot;Heirs to the Underground, or What Keeps Russian Culture Going&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Kultura, October 2005).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Responding to the complaint of a Western colleague that &quot;It's impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> work in Russia - so many brilliant personalities, but no institutions at
</I>&gt;<i> all,&quot; Prokhorova explains that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is peculiar about Russia is not the absence of institutions as such,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather a fatal discrepancy between those institutions and the functions
</I>&gt;<i> they were created to fulfil...The most important result of this social
</I>&gt;<i> deformation has been the spontaneous evolution of informal, parallel
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures of social life in Russia, which usually remain in the shadow
</I>&gt;<i> of public attention and are therefore difficult to access
</I>&gt;<i> for outsiders. (Prokhorova,2005).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This situation, Prokhorova argues, has clearly created a &quot;cultural
</I>&gt;<i> duality,&quot; one of the consequences of which has been the strengthening of
</I>&gt;<i> Russian literature as a social institution.This, in turn, supported the
</I>&gt;<i> emergence and consolidation between the 1950s and the 1980s of a strong and
</I>&gt;<i> varied Russian underground movement.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Prokhorova emphasises that the underground movement should not be seen as a
</I>&gt;<i> unified group opposing Soviet totalitarianism (a fairly common point of view
</I>&gt;<i> until recently in the US and Europe) but rather as &quot;an alternative social
</I>&gt;<i> universe with its own creative associations and circles, its own authorities
</I>&gt;<i> and aesthetic criteria, its own press, an efficient distribution system for
</I>&gt;<i> its political and artistic production, its own literary prizes, a social
</I>&gt;<i> life with its own peculiar rituals, its own foreign
</I>&gt;<i> contacts&quot;. (Prokhorova,2005).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *It could be said this description corresponds quite neatly to the model
</I>&gt;<i> of the Russian Internet. This feeling is reinforced by Prokhorova's
</I>&gt;<i> assertion that the style of behaviour characteristic of the underground
</I>&gt;<i> movement centred on a narrow circle of friends. It continued, and in many
</I>&gt;<i> new professional ways developed, in the 1990s and remains valid to this day.
</I>&gt;<i> Prokhorova talks about the &quot;internet boom, which spawned a plethora of
</I>&gt;<i> virtual projects.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *She singles out the economic crisis of 1998, which triggered a shift of
</I>&gt;<i> political priorities, setting off mechanisms that she defines as &quot;partial
</I>&gt;<i> re-Sovietisation.&quot;  She specifically identifies the restoration process set
</I>&gt;<i> in motion after the crisis, targeting the weak socio-cultural institutions
</I>&gt;<i> of the late and post-Soviet periods, &quot;in an attempt to concentrate all means
</I>&gt;<i> of influencing public opinion in the hands of the state.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Prokhorova perceives the role of the internet as a response to just such
</I>&gt;<i> developments. The new medium follows on from the pioneering age of self-made
</I>&gt;<i> and na&#239;ve websites.  In Russia and elsewhere this age has given way to
</I>&gt;<i> web-based platforms with endless networking possibilities. The natural *modus
</I>&gt;<i> vivendi* of these networks in Russia is aimed, in Prokhorova's view, at
</I>&gt;<i> preserving and restructuring the system of cultural initiatives that
</I>&gt;<i> supported the existence of an alternative social universe in Soviet
</I>&gt;<i> times. It was legitimised, albeit on a very shaky base, in the first
</I>&gt;<i> post-Soviet decade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is in this alternative social universe, she maintains, that heated
</I>&gt;<i> political debates and fully-fledged literary disputes take place. As
</I>&gt;<i> researchers of the Russian Internet will have noticed, debates and disputes
</I>&gt;<i> are indeed intense and at times fierce, but they are far from mobilising
</I>&gt;<i> enduring forms of activism, particularly activism with tangible social and
</I>&gt;<i> political repercussions offline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should these repercussions be relevant for Russian internet users involved
</I>&gt;<i> in a vibrant and varied alternative social reality? I have discussed this
</I>&gt;<i> with a large number of Russian Internet users and experts.  In their view
</I>&gt;<i> researchers seeking signs of political activism are repeating the pattern of
</I>&gt;<i> their colleagues who, in Soviet times, regarded the underground movement as
</I>&gt;<i> a single whole united in its opposition to Soviet totalitarianism. A handful
</I>&gt;<i> of activists were undeniably committed to that cause and bravely ready to
</I>&gt;<i> risk their own life and freedom. It should not, however, be forgotten that
</I>&gt;<i> the vast majority of the Soviet underground movement was motivated by the
</I>&gt;<i> very natural urge to express publicly various points of view on personal,
</I>&gt;<i> artistic and cultural issues and ultimately to have fun amid the grim
</I>&gt;<i> realities of Soviet life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Buffer reality, not activisttool*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *After a discussion on online engagement and participatory internet in
</I>&gt;<i> Russia in October 2008 one of the participants posted on his LiveJournal
</I>&gt;<i> blog the following comment:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Participants were engaged and the discussion wasinteresting. I was,
</I>&gt;<i> however, rather surprised by the serious approach of some [participants]
</I>&gt;<i> towards civil activism&#8230; In Russia this kind of engagement has a real effect
</I>&gt;<i> only when it is supported by other activities carried out among personal
</I>&gt;<i> connections in the so-called corridors of power. (Drugoi &lt;Rustem Adagamov&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 2008).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The blogger writing this comment was Live Journal User Rustem Adagamov. His
</I>&gt;<i> identity on Russia's best-known blogging platform is User Drugoi (Russian
</I>&gt;<i> for The Other).  Adagamov's interesting photoblog&lt;<A HREF="http://drugoi.livejournal.com/2730303.html#cutid1">http://drugoi.livejournal.com/2730303.html#cutid1</A>&gt;has consistently been one of the leaders of the Russian blogosphere and the
</I>&gt;<i> unchallenged leader of Live Journal in 2008. According to Yandex, Russia's
</I>&gt;<i> main search engine, the blog had 198,644 hits on January 7, 2009 and had
</I>&gt;<i> enjoyed roughly the same popularity index throughout 2008.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adagamov's assessment reached beyond the particular cases discussed at the
</I>&gt;<i> symposium.  He said that &quot;no online petition or mobilisation carried out in
</I>&gt;<i> online communities and street actions&quot; can achieve tangible results in the
</I>&gt;<i> offline reality unless it is supported by informal ties with powerful
</I>&gt;<i> decision-makers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Russian Internet users, currently estimated at nearly 28 million, are
</I>&gt;<i> generally defensive and mistrustful of the Internet's potential for
</I>&gt;<i> democratisation.  This is often masked by a layer of cynicism. The main
</I>&gt;<i> reason for this distrust would appear to be the emergence of an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> social universe, which has exploited modern technological developments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *If substantiated by comprehensive empirical research, this trend would
</I>&gt;<i> indicate that the Internet has also assumed the role of a tool of adjustment
</I>&gt;<i> to a political reality that users see outside their realistic personal and
</I>&gt;<i> collective influence. This hypothesis for the moment seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> substantiated by the results of public opinion research.  Levada &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCIOM">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCIOM</A>&gt;Centre
</I>&gt;<i> polls, for instance, show that 72% of Russians in 2007 said they had no way
</I>&gt;<i> to influence the state decision-making process. 80% believed they were not
</I>&gt;<i> able to participate in the political and economic life of the country.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this respect internet users are in tune with the majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> population. Russian sociologists affirm that it is adjustment strategies,
</I>&gt;<i> together with distrust of every civil society institution (with the notable
</I>&gt;<i> exclusion of the presidency) that are responsible for the lack of widespread
</I>&gt;<i> civil activity aimed at change on- and offline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sociologist Boris Dubin describes post-Soviet Russia as an &quot;adjusting
</I>&gt;<i> society&quot; (Dubin2008). He conceptualises adjustment in terms of &quot;passive and
</I>&gt;<i> mainly reactive (in a stimulus-reaction mode) behaviour of most social
</I>&gt;<i> groups.&quot; Dubin notes that the definition relates to behaviour &quot;dependent on
</I>&gt;<i> the centralised power, on a social and political order imposed by this powe
</I>&gt;<i> rand accepted by the population, rather than on citizens' assertion of their
</I>&gt;<i> own individual and group interest or a vigorous activity aimed at changing
</I>&gt;<i> the balance of social forces&quot;. (Dubin 2008).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Dubin's view, this behaviour is determined by habit and by the fear of
</I>&gt;<i> losing perceived securities. It deeply influences attitudes, ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in different forms of criticism of other people's activity and
</I>&gt;<i> success. Widespread forms of disapproval are in turn fertile soil for
</I>&gt;<i> negative and generally cynical approaches toward &quot;the other&quot; and strictly
</I>&gt;<i> limit the emergence of attitudes of positive solidarity for anyone outside
</I>&gt;<i> one's immediate circle of family and like-minded individuals. Equally
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, the adaptation mode is seen by Dubin as one of the main reasons
</I>&gt;<i> for the fragmentation of civil activity and the atomisation of society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dubin sees a direct correlation between these reactive and fragmentary
</I>&gt;<i> tendencies and the protective reflexes that support the continued existence
</I>&gt;<i> of an alternative social universe. The correlation, essential for the study
</I>&gt;<i> of Internet engagement and mobilisation, is based on the conviction that any
</I>&gt;<i> social form of social initiative can be manipulated by the state. Levada
</I>&gt;<i> Centre data in the last few years record feelings of vulnerability and
</I>&gt;<i> individual weakness vis-&#224;-vis the law and the very institutions in charge of
</I>&gt;<i> enforcing it, including the courts, prosecutors and the police. This feeling
</I>&gt;<i> been growing among Russians and is now common to more than two-thirds of the
</I>&gt;<i> population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a recent article another Russian sociologist, Daniel Dondurei, lamented
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot; the huge number of contrasting interpretations of events of the last
</I>&gt;<i> two decades seems to have confused many people. According to recent polls
</I>&gt;<i> some three-quarters of Russians think of themselves as happy, roughly the
</I>&gt;<i> same amount approve the official stance on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time do not trust any official, except the president and the
</I>&gt;<i> prime minister. Despite the fact that private property is widespread and
</I>&gt;<i> legal, most people continue to rely mostly on the state. At the same time,
</I>&gt;<i> 78% of businessmen, when involved in commercial disputes, say they prefer to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid court decisions because they do not trust the impartiality of the
</I>&gt;<i> judges. Such eclecticism is not an accident. The Russian political, economic
</I>&gt;<i> and media elite has been working intensively and assiduously to manipulate
</I>&gt;<i> social perceptions. This has resulted in public disenchantment with
</I>&gt;<i> modernisations.&quot;(Dondurei 2008).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dondurei appears to sustain Dubin's argument concerning adjustment and its
</I>&gt;<i> dangers when he asks &quot;how are we going to fight legal nihilism whenthe
</I>&gt;<i> public has completely adjusted to it?   Six out of ten citizens
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge that they have a more or less tolerant attitude towards
</I>&gt;<i> corruption. Some of them believe that it is actually corruption that allows
</I>&gt;<i> the complex system of Russian life to function&quot; (Dondurei 2008).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Call for joint research*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This article does not aim to be judgmental about different scholarly
</I>&gt;<i> approaches to internet research.  Far from it.  It is meant to be a call for
</I>&gt;<i> more joint research on the different aspects of internet use, in particular
</I>&gt;<i> on the internet as a tool of adjustment aimed at preserving an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> social universe.   Strategies adopted by different actors -communities of
</I>&gt;<i> various orientation, as well as manipulative groups often linked to the
</I>&gt;<i> state - to achieve their goals should also be examined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Reuters Institute's pilot project concluded that in the Russian
</I>&gt;<i> context, at present at least, new developments in communication are not
</I>&gt;<i> breaking down well-established patterns of power. The state remains the main
</I>&gt;<i> mobilising agent. Following a few years of spontaneous - and inexpensive -
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;anarchy', RuNet currently operates as a device to spread and share
</I>&gt;<i> information, but largely among closed clusters of like-minded users who are
</I>&gt;<i> seldom able or willing to cooperate. However, it is also a platform which
</I>&gt;<i> the state uses increasingly successfully to consolidate its power. The
</I>&gt;<i> activists are rendered at best only partly effective by their limited public
</I>&gt;<i> and political skills, difficulty in fostering productive discussion among
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, and inability to overcome the widespread lack of trust among
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our pilot research by and large confirmed Dubin's view that RuNet (at least
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment) is restricted to the status of &#8216;a device to test one's own
</I>&gt;<i> circle' and can be used to reproduce mechanisms of propaganda and
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation well tested offline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a great need for multi-disciplinary studies that would link the
</I>&gt;<i> use of the Russian internet for literary expression to strategies explaining
</I>&gt;<i> how information technologies are shaped by the social context in which they
</I>&gt;<i> are deployed.  Literary expression would include such interesting
</I>&gt;<i> developments as the widespread language of *padonki and &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padonki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padonki</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> *its possible use for manipulation and verbal bullying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A United Nations report&lt;<A HREF="http://www.unrisd.org/infotech/conferen/russian/toc.htm">http://www.unrisd.org/infotech/conferen/russian/toc.htm</A>&gt;examined the emergence of new telecommunication technologies in the late
</I>&gt;<i> years of the Soviet Union and the early post-Soviet era.  In it researcher
</I>&gt;<i> Rafal Rahozinski said &quot;what is the most interesting about the internet's
</I>&gt;<i> emergence in Russia is not the way in which technology transformed society,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather the way in which society colonised the technology.&quot; The report
</I>&gt;<i> was published in 1999 and it would be extremely valuable to see whether
</I>&gt;<i> Rahozinski's conclusion can still be considered relevant.
