End of Money and the Future of Civilization From P2P Foundation Jump to:

*Book: Thomas Greco. The End of Money and the Future of Civilization*
[edit&lt;?title=End_of_Money_and_the_Future_of_Civilization&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1&gt;
]
Description

&quot;The End of Money and the Future of Civilization considers the money problem
within the broad historical and political context that has made the control
of money and banking the primary mechanism for concentrating power and
wealth and the nullification of democratic governance.


It provides the necessary understanding for entrepreneurs, activists, and
civic leaders to implement approaches toward monetary liberation, approaches
that empower communities to restore their environments and democratic
institutions, and begin to build economies that are sustainable, equitable,
and insulated from the financial crises that plague the dominant systems of
money, banking and finance.


It provides specific design proposals and exchange-system architectures for
local, regional, national, and global financial systems, and offers
strategies for their implementation prescribing actions that grassroots
organizations, businesses, and governments will need to take to achieve
success.&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm seeing a number or responders who actually get &quot;free&quot; and &quot;at cost&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> the context of peer production and they're all young with no exception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Older people not only use money to obfuscate deeper fears about themselves
</I>&gt;<i> and the world but they are also more suspicious of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;at cost&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To update you on the experiment, I've just taken two young entrepreneurs on
</I>&gt;<i> the basis that if I help them make their dream come true for &quot;free&quot; then
</I>&gt;<i> they ought to turn around and help others do the same thing. They get that,
</I>&gt;<i> totally, and are very excited about it. They have also demonstrated that
</I>&gt;<i> they're willing to do as much of the production as possible and are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in doing 100% of the production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it's this interest and demonstration of capacity to be their own
</I>&gt;<i> producers that really grabs my interest. What drives me is: how many people
</I>&gt;<i> can I empower?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While responders from the older crowd (those 25-45 yrs old) backed off the
</I>&gt;<i> minute their 'dream' was basically handed to them at a nominal cost (or even
</I>&gt;<i> for free had they asked for it) the younger crowd seem to be very excited
</I>&gt;<i> and are subscribing to the idea that we can start a model where everyone
</I>&gt;<i> helps everyone to become their own producers, and that by doing so everyone
</I>&gt;<i> benefits!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the older crowd had more than just the fear of failure in the
</I>&gt;<i> way of achieving their dreams. After further dialog, it's become clear that
</I>&gt;<i> they have resistance to the idea that anyone should be able to produce their
</I>&gt;<i> own iPhone idea because the idea of &quot;scarcity creation&quot; as the means for
</I>&gt;<i> profit is burnt into their brains. If they uphold the scarcity system then
</I>&gt;<i> the skills they've developed in terms of hording power, money, and
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual &quot;property&quot; all goes out of the window and they'd have to learn
</I>&gt;<i> how to operate in a world where the goal is abundance creation and where
</I>&gt;<i> those who enable the most abundance benefit the most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that in order to start a new economy based on gift giving or
</I>&gt;<i> at-cost trading we'd have to start with young people who have not yet
</I>&gt;<i> developed a psychologically complex relationship to money and are willing to
</I>&gt;<i> leave the world of scarcity behind (the world they know) and embrace the
</I>&gt;<i> world of abundance and openness (which has a completely different and far
</I>&gt;<i> more positive kind of empowerment)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is definitely a lot to be learned from putting models in practice and
</I>&gt;<i> seeing what works and what doesn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theories concocted on a keyboard change dramatically upon contact with
</I>&gt;<i> reality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as Eisenhower and Clausewitz before him said, &quot;forget the plan;
</I>&gt;<i> planning is everything&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Working on theories helps us understand what it is that we really want to
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish, but without practice no theory stands a chance of being correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm learning now is that I want to empower others and have them
</I>&gt;<i> empower others to be their own producers (of iPhone software in my case) and
</I>&gt;<i> the easiest way to do it seems to be &quot;free&quot; or &quot;at cost&quot; with YOUNG
</I>&gt;<i> participants. The keyword is &quot;YOUNG&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a lot more to be learned from continuing with the experimentation
</I>&gt;<i> than from thinking about the logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see huge potential for the P2P Energy Economy but I doubt very much
</I>&gt;<i> that an absolute-value currency like the Joule Tokens can be made practical.
</I>&gt;<i> The challenge is how to make the currency relative (to something other than
</I>&gt;<i> demand and supply) while also making it abundance sustaining. I doubt that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has solved the paradox... but if anyone has any ideas on such types
</I>&gt;<i> of currencies please don't hesitate to throw them out there.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess all us programmers think alike.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm already experimenting with &quot;near zero cost&quot; software production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services and people's behavior (as documented through the exchanges I've had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to date, which I will anonymize and publicize as part of a study) is very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting and defeats every economic theory out there, including my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking on 'equitable exchnge' (or &quot;at cost&quot; exchange)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I put out this ad on Craigslist - Manhattan, and I picked Manhattan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it's the bustling center of capitalism. I wanted the input to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experiment to be well defined, with as little ambiguity as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See: <A HREF="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bus/1052325574.html">http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bus/1052325574.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what is $250 (upfront cost of the service) for a local developer with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my experience when programmers in Belarus (who have contacted me following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ad) charge 10X the money for the same service?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is basically &quot;near zero&quot; relative to the market price of the service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but to me it is roughly how much it would cost me in calories and coffee to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deliver the service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So that's me experimenting with my own theory of &quot;trading at the cost in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work energy it takes to produce and deliver the good or service.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The result is very mind opening.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that &quot;trade&quot; has far more deeper emotional/psychological
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dimensions than rational ones.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rationally, you'd think people would be hounding me to work on their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iPhone this and iPhone that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have great samples to show them and I have a 100% rational step-driven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction process that I designed carefully to be as rationally assuring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as possible so that a rational person would experience a flow-through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process from initial contact to delivery.  I will publish this interaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process as part of the study, in anonymized fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also say something nice about their idea and thank them for their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you would think that paying for software production as a service at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price that is 10X less than what you'd get from a programmer in Belarus and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10X less than what you'd get from the lowest market price out there, at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceivably 10X the quality, combined very powerful/creative demos (work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> samples) and an exact, logical (yet emotionally positive/affirming)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction process in a very hot market (relative to the state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general market) would results in people 'begging' to get the service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is happening, however, is that if I read deeply (or listen deeply) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their intent what they really want (which is hugely obfuscated by the way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language is used in business dialog) is that they have other unmet needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that supercede making money and it may be scary for some to realize that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they CAN actually produce that idea they have been fantasizing about (many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have told me of their iPhone ideas that they have been fantasizing about for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a while) which then exposes them to the fear of what if the idea does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sell once it's made? will that expose them to their insecurities which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now hiding behind a cost barrier?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, I am realizing that trade has many hidden dimensions, one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of which that some people, some of the time, actually need to hide behind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> barriers like the barrier of something being too costly to attain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, when people are given a zero barrier to a certain want or need that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they did not realistically think they could have but always dreamt about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having then they may prefer the dream to the reality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, as I said already, let's say that these people are mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dreamers (because the ad I wrote probably appeals most to that segment) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have this one idea that they have been harboring and dreaming about for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a while and it has become a psychological shelter like: if only I can make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this idea happen I will be all set. So when someone comes to them and offers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make the idea at near-zero cost (i.e. lowers the barrier enough that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can simply walk over it, and even if they had no legs they can crawl over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it) then all the sudden they pull back. They recognize something wrong has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happened: they need the dream of having the product more than they need the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual product.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, if I was to change the barrier so that it is just a little beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their reach, e.g. $2,500 instead of $500, then they would feel a strong pull
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from their other insecurity: &quot;if I can only take a little more risk I bet I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will succeed&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The people are invited to check out some really clever and powerful iPhone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> demos I've made (mostly game physics/graphics related) and they are invited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to talk to former CEOs, VCs, etc, i.e. an over abundance of assurance of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to make their dream happen, and I am genuine about wanting to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them realize their dreams (in my spare time.) It's an experiment at one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level and a genuine desire to help people at another level (without over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stretching myself)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the conclusion from this is that &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;exchange&quot; is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pyschological game with many up-till-now hidden dimensions. Equal exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe less favorable than unequal exchange or vice versa, and we cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decide on what will make people engage and complete an exchange unless we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand their psychological motives.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I offer the service completely for free, then people who want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;dependence&quot; on others as a way to live will definitely want to complete the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchnge but only if &quot;I&quot; take care of them and cater to their every need.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Same if I offer it for money. It does not change a thing. Peopel are willing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pay to be able to have such dependence on someone, and my process is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> totally against dependence. I want to empower them to co-produce the product
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I want them to achieve their dream, but they may want to purchase
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependence or get dependence for free and cling to their dream instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turning it into a reality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you see, it has nothing to do with rational thought and everything to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do with emotional/psychological needs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are people of course who want to be empowered to achieve their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dream.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have yet to see any such people in my so-far limited sample (I got about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6 or 7 inquiries in the last 2 days since I posted the ad)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am sure a larger sample set would have a larger variety of people, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even though I picked New York, the city that never sleeps and the capital of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the capitalist world, I still have a sample (so far) that's made up entirely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of people who are afraid and who view money as a barrier to hide behind when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's convenient and to jump across (if they're feeling daring enough) but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never as a means for equitable exchange, i.e. money always associated with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deeper fears and insecurities than the fear of money itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll update you on how the experiment evolves but I could easily say that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;phase I: removing the fear of money itself by making it almost irrelevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through at-cost trading&quot; is now done (ready to move on to Phase II) and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conclusions I'm making from Phase I is that people have far deeper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fears/insecurities than money, and they use money as both a protective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> barrier (blame their state on their lack of money) or as a great gap that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they dare themselves to jump across (blame their state on their lack of risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taking, which if overcome with counter-phobia can lead to gambling or worse:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throwing money out of the window to prove their courage)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The relationship man has with &quot;money&quot; is one where man uses money to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obfuscate far deeper fears.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what you say is completely correct in my opinion. being a programmer i
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expect that i will become wealthy easily (which is actually already the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> case
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now). so even though the current system has many advantages for me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> personally, logic tells me that such a system cannot be good because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are other people out there who are less fortunate. so yesterday i had a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funny idea: once i have enough for me i could open a Zero-Dollar-Shop,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everything is free. I just want to see what happens! I expect some people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> act very silly, spiling goods and so on but i also expect them to quickly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> get bored.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What i saw many times is that people act more sane and humane if they are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> free to decide: For example when i travel to dresden by train and go back
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the same day there is a special one-day ticket that is cheaper than two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rides. but additonally this ticket is valid for up to five persons. so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> common practice that people wo have such a ticket sell the free spaces to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> others. however, when i ask people if they want to travel with me and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ask me how much they have to pay i say &quot;you're free to decide - it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cheaper
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for me either way.&quot; and i really mean it. many people react very
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> confused.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's interesting that all people that i asked so far gave me 5 or even 6
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> euros. a friend of mine once tried it the capitalist way and tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sell
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the free ticket space for 5 euro. the other person tried to beat it down
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3,80 and my friend disagreed so it was in the end more expensive for both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them!

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think that we can't purify human nature with logic.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The P2P Energy Economy model (on P2Pf wiki) goes to extreme lengths in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; areas to make sure that the model's logic supersedes human
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> irrationality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the impure nature) but that resulted in one fatal contradiction: people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; should be able to give things completely for free without any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expectation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e. true generosity) which the model had no way of allowing while
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; enforcing equitable exchange. So I've moved away from trying to purify
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; human
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; nature with logic and resorted to the much more limited goal of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enabling
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; voluntary reciprocal exchanges in immaterial resources that are already
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; abundant (e.g. digital content) so as to have a participatory protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; sustains the abundance of the given resource on scalable basis. That's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; much lower intervention than trying to constrain human behavior... and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; still thinking about it...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Giving and getting recommendations (or respect) in a reciprocal or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; generalized exchange is an ancient common social practice.  I can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; recommend
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; you if you recommend me back, or I can recommend you without
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expecting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; you recommend me back. This is a common social practice and can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; reciprocal exchange or as a generalized (non-reciprocal) exchange.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Someone who is highly political can accumulate a lot of so-called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;respect&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; without having any moral or intellectual merit.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Try to solve that!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; i.e. how do you ensure that respect in society flows not based on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; political
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; favoritism but based on rational thought.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My idea was to always have the respect coupled to the action it was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> given
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for; your example is a disadvantage of the respect systems that we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; now,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; where the motivation for paying respect can become very irrational.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Having
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the respect together with the reason it was paid for would allow me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; evaluate my personal respect to that person based on my personal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; standards.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, i have no idea how this could be implemented practically.
