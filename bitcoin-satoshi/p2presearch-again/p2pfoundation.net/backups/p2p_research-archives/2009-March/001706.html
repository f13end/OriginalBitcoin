&gt;<i> Vivarium - A Proposal for a Modest Experiment in P2P Architecture
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [soundtrack: Constructors - Zatoichi OST]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Drive To Build:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an instinctive compulsion to architecture in the human being. Left
</I>&gt;<i> to their own devices, as children more often were in the recent past, they
</I>&gt;<i> build. Growing up in the suburbs of the NY metropolitan area at a time when
</I>&gt;<i> American children were not quite yet relegated by their parents' paranoia to
</I>&gt;<i> an existence as juvenile inmates, I was witness to an interesting phenomenon
</I>&gt;<i> that emerged in response to the cultural squalor of the suburbs. Contrary to
</I>&gt;<i> the common delusion that suburbs are designed for child raising, there has
</I>&gt;<i> generally never been a place for children in that environment. Suburbs are
</I>&gt;<i> made for cars, not kids. (as if the number of them run over by their own
</I>&gt;<i> parents when backing vehicles out of the driveway hasn't made that fact
</I>&gt;<i> obvious) The problem with suburbs, of course, is a distinct lack of spacial
</I>&gt;<i> identity. There is no 'sense of place' anyplace, let alone places for kids.
</I>&gt;<i> And so kids of the time were inclined to create this themselves in spaces
</I>&gt;<i> adults overlooked or abandoned, most commonly the 'green belts' and other
</I>&gt;<i> fractured bits of natural landscape in the surrounding areas. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> throughout the wooded areas of the metropolitan fringes one was (and still)
</I>&gt;<i> likely to find -aside from the piles of trash, abandoned cars and
</I>&gt;<i> appliances, and mysterious masses of rusting unmarked chemical drums, a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of makeshift encampments, tree-houses, shacks, 'forts', skate board
</I>&gt;<i> ramps, and 'dirt bike' courses, all created by and for kids using whatever
</I>&gt;<i> cast-off materials they could scrounge up from the trash around them. Adults
</I>&gt;<i> (those who actually owned these forgotten bits of land especially), of
</I>&gt;<i> course had no respect for such endeavors and these constructions were
</I>&gt;<i> routinely declared Dens of Iniquity, raided, and razed whenever some less
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent child managed to injure himself in a sufficiently dramatic
</I>&gt;<i> manner or when the local generation of children reached That Certain Age,
</I>&gt;<i> only to re-appear in some other location once the 'heat was off'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly, invention and building represent essential human forms of play
</I>&gt;<i> that are sadly unfulfilled in our contemporary culture, manifesting among
</I>&gt;<i> children in activity adults seem to compulsively suppress as 'dangerous' and
</I>&gt;<i> would rather redirect into the safer forms of 'hobbies' they can better
</I>&gt;<i> control. The DIY and craft industries, the customization of cars, the
</I>&gt;<i> fanatical adult fans of building toys like Lego, and the more recent Maker
</I>&gt;<i> movement certainly seem to reflect this suppressed desire for making and
</I>&gt;<i> building as play that isn't exclusive to the child or the specially
</I>&gt;<i> talented. But often the social dimension is missing. What point creativity
</I>&gt;<i> without an audience? What point invention without others for it to benefit?
</I>&gt;<i> Thus in the communities that emerge around these hobbies a compulsion to
</I>&gt;<i> gather exists, realized through conventions, expositions, and competitions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Sandbox for Architectural Recreation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't normally think of architecture as a form of play. Assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> task beyond us or simply too important for failure and thus beyond personal
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation, we relegate the creation of our built habitat to
</I>&gt;<i> professionals. To a certain extent this is quite practical. Without some
</I>&gt;<i> degree of engineering knowledge employed to insure their integrity, large
</I>&gt;<i> buildings would be quite dangerous. But for most of the history of human
</I>&gt;<i> civilization, most construction was conducted without the benefit of such
</I>&gt;<i> professionals and, since adopting the dependence upon them in modern times,
</I>&gt;<i> our instinctive desire to express ourselves through our built habitat goes
</I>&gt;<i> unfulfilled. What if we could better integrate this form of play and
</I>&gt;<i> constructive/creative socialization into our built habitat? What if we could
</I>&gt;<i> create an environment specifically for casual 'architectural recreation';
</I>&gt;<i> for building as social play? Recently, the P2P cultural community has begun
</I>&gt;<i> to explore the notion of P2P Architecture and Open Source Urbanism. But
</I>&gt;<i> these are concepts hard to move beyond the level of theoretical discussion
</I>&gt;<i> -particularly in a world where the structure of the built habitat is so
</I>&gt;<i> often under the control of people incapable of comprehending much of this
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual discussion. It would be extremely valuable to have a venue for
</I>&gt;<i> physical experimentation with principles of P2P Architecture and the
</I>&gt;<i> technologies of adaptive architecture and I think the key to that may rest
</I>&gt;<i> in this notion of architectural recreation, in the idea of creation a place
</I>&gt;<i> where one builds space for fun. Thus we arrive at a proposal I call the
</I>&gt;<i> Vivarium.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Vivarium is a simple idea. It is a place whose functional purpose in
</I>&gt;<i> fun and comfort, intended as a public meeting and lounge area -a social
</I>&gt;<i> club- where people go to relax and amuse themselves in a casual social
</I>&gt;<i> venue. Nothing unusual there except that in this place all the structures
</I>&gt;<i> used for these purposes are created by the users of the space. Thus they get
</I>&gt;<i> to collectively/interactively decide how the space is used and they create
</I>&gt;<i> the structures they want for that. The participants decide what 'fun' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'comfort' mean and it's up to them to implement that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Vivarium would be based on appropriating some relatively large
</I>&gt;<i> clear-span whether-sheltered 'purposeless' space -an empty industrial
</I>&gt;<i> building for example- that is in a relatively convenient location for its
</I>&gt;<i> community of users and which would support the creation of light
</I>&gt;<i> free-standing structures inside it. The basic space supplies little itself;
</I>&gt;<i> basic toilet facilities, electricity, basic heating and cooling, access to
</I>&gt;<i> Internet and television. Everything else is up to the users to make. To
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate the project, a companion workshop and storage facility may also
</I>&gt;<i> be provided so as to eliminate the need to fabricate parts for structures
</I>&gt;<i> within the Vivarium space, limiting work there to simple assembly and
</I>&gt;<i> disassembly to keep it clean, comfortable, and relatively quiet. The ideal
</I>&gt;<i> community would be a group of creative people, artists, and their friends
</I>&gt;<i> with some inclination toward making things and perhaps some experience with
</I>&gt;<i> some of the common adaptive building technologies currently available;
</I>&gt;<i> Matrix/Box Beam/Grid Beam, T-slot profile framing, simple space frames. tent
</I>&gt;<i> structures. creative cardboard construction, etc. The club would be
</I>&gt;<i> invitation-based with building access limited to the membership in order to
</I>&gt;<i> reduce the potential for theft and vandalism. However, regular open houses
</I>&gt;<i> would be conducted to provide a public demonstration of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key to the experiment represented by the project would be to impose as
</I>&gt;<i> few rules as possible on how the space is used, leaving this up to the
</I>&gt;<i> imaginations of the participants and their negotiations on use of space. But
</I>&gt;<i> a few simple 'house rules' would be useful as a starting point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Employ Common Sense. A pretty obvious rule. No open fires. No hazardous
</I>&gt;<i> material. No blocking emergency exits. Use electricity safely. Etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) No Nails. All the structures deployed in the space must be demountable,
</I>&gt;<i> assembled without nails or glues except with the fabrication of
</I>&gt;<i> subcomponents. Structures of two or more levels may be allowed given the
</I>&gt;<i> ceiling height, but for safety without serious engineering approvals two or
</I>&gt;<i> three storeys may be a practical limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Space is alloted on a first-come-first-serve basis moderated by
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. Members propose an amount and use of space and the collective
</I>&gt;<i> membership approves or rejects this proposal. Relatively small private
</I>&gt;<i> personal structures can be built without approval as long as there's no
</I>&gt;<i> dispute over the location. Larger structures will require more active
</I>&gt;<i> negotiation with and consensus approval by the group -and most likely group
</I>&gt;<i> participation to build them. Initially, space may be alloted to initial
</I>&gt;<i> members as a percentage share of the overall volume and they can contribute
</I>&gt;<i> all or portions of this to group-built structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) All built structures have a 30 day 'lease'. At the end of 30 days, the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the club vote on whether to give them another month or remove
</I>&gt;<i> them to free up space. They can also vote to adapt rather than remove,
</I>&gt;<i> giving the creators of a structure the option to adapt it to accommodate
</I>&gt;<i> specific issues the group may have in order to gain another 30 days lease.
</I>&gt;<i> And, of course, the creators of the structure can, for as long as the
</I>&gt;<i> structure is allowed space by the group, adapt it or remove it as they see
</I>&gt;<i> fit. This 30 day lease is intended to insure members maintain the structures
</I>&gt;<i> they build and that underutilized space is continuously freed-up for other
</I>&gt;<i> uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Habitation is limited to 48 contiguous hours in any week period. It may
</I>&gt;<i> not be practical to let people actually live in this experimental project,
</I>&gt;<i> though later this rule could be dropped if it seems like a functional
</I>&gt;<i> cohabitation is possible. In later larger scale Vivarium experiments,
</I>&gt;<i> continuous residence would be the key objective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These basic rules would be intended only as loose conventions. As the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the Vivarium gain social experience, they may add or drop house
</I>&gt;<i> rules as they see fit by consensus. Since all structures would be
</I>&gt;<i> demountable and adaptable, free and dynamic negotiation on space would be no
</I>&gt;<i> particular problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To facilitate brainstorming at the start of the project by helping people
</I>&gt;<i> easily visualize possible structures, an initial common building system may
</I>&gt;<i> be proposed, with Grid Beam or similar post and beam systems a likely choice
</I>&gt;<i> based on economy and recyclability of parts and materials. This would be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful where the project is largely supported on grants. Structures with
</I>&gt;<i> common building systems would have the advantage of structural integration,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing participants to link up their structures and trade in components
</I>&gt;<i> and their fabrication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many of the issues associated with P2P architecture -social, logistical,
</I>&gt;<i> and technical- on larger scales would potentially be represented in this
</I>&gt;<i> simple experiment. Cultivating systems of negotiation over space use, public
</I>&gt;<i> and personal property, management of noise, energy efficiency, and much more
</I>&gt;<i> would need to be worked out, with this casual venue offering 'low stakes'
</I>&gt;<i> environment to explore this. Technology and designs developed in this
</I>&gt;<i> experiment would also have many applications elsewhere, particularly for
</I>&gt;<i> relief architecture, public art projects, and exposition structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Vivarium has the potential to generate many imitations or spin-offs and
</I>&gt;<i> produce progressively larger projects using more sophisticated building
</I>&gt;<i> technology, eventually moving beyond the limits of repurposed pre-existing
</I>&gt;<i> enclosures to the use of independently weather-tight structures in an open
</I>&gt;<i> environment. Clearly, this idea of group architectural recreation -of
</I>&gt;<i> building adaptive structures and evolving complex environments as art and
</I>&gt;<i> play- has much potential and could become the impetus for many projects and
</I>&gt;<i> experiments. Certainly, events such as Burning Man, increasingly focused on
</I>&gt;<i> inventive temporary structures as artistic installations, hints at the
</I>&gt;<i> potential a continuous venue for such creativity might afford. This seems an
</I>&gt;<i> accessible project, well within the means of any sufficiently motivated and
</I>&gt;<i> creative group in most location, though likely better suited to urban areas
</I>&gt;<i> with a concentrated community of art and design enthusiasts able to casually
</I>&gt;<i> access this space like a local social club.
