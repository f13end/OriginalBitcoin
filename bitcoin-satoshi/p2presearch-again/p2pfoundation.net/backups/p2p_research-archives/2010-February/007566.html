The problem is putting trust in the service provider, and also
in the availability of your data. It's a no-brainer that your
provider will snoop you out and rat on you, and that there's no
accountability is case of total loss of data, or even transient
unavailability (even it's a commercial service).

Admittedly a decent (=fast) NAS will set you back around 600 EUR sans drives.
But baseline NAS (PogoPlug) starts at around 100 EUR. Slow but usable
NAS is around 300 EUR.

We've got already people trying to evade deep packet inspection and Layer 7
traffic throttline, playing cat and mouse with the cheap providers (the
decent kind charge enough/provide decent data plans so that throttling
is unnecessary).

There will be still the Internet as we know it, and even if I have to
roll my own. I run my own &quot;cloud&quot; (uck, ptui), have my own networks,
my ISP is nothing but a (hostile, untrusted) transport layer.

You can do very decent meshes with Level 3 switches and FTTC/FTTH. The
reason it's not being done is mostly because policy is easier to roll

You've got accounting and trust issues. You can't really sandbox code.
Because there's no p2p online currency (despite BitCoin &amp; Co) there's no
way to cash in on services rendered to the community.

Geeks are always 10-20 years ahead of the mainstream. As Gibson said, the 
future's here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.
