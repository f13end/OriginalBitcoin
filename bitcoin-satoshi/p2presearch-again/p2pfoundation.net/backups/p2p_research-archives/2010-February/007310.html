<PRE>Superb, Eric, as usual!!

On Thu, Feb 4, 2010 at 10:46 PM, Eric Hunting &lt;<A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">erichunting at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Cameron Sinclair is well known as one of the chief proponents of the new
</I>&gt;<i> socially responsible architecture movement that has been sweeping across the
</I>&gt;<i> design community over the past decade. It is no surprise to find he and
</I>&gt;<i> Architecture for Humanity so immediately in the thick of the Haiti crisis,
</I>&gt;<i> teaming with NGOs, developing a recovery plan, and putting people on the
</I>&gt;<i> ground. In this recent article, originally from the Architecture for
</I>&gt;<i> Humanity blog site, he offers a light overview of their reconstruction plan
</I>&gt;<i> as its being developed and an interesting glimpse at the complex situation
</I>&gt;<i> it must cope with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The breadth of practical recovery logistics knowledge AfH has gathered
</I>&gt;<i> together is remarkable for such a still relatively young organization. And
</I>&gt;<i> their community-focused approach is very significant. This is not the
</I>&gt;<i> military-style short-term thinking that deals only in mass populations as is
</I>&gt;<i> common to relief agencies but real long-term planning that actually
</I>&gt;<i> recognizes communities as functional entities in the reconstruction process.
</I>&gt;<i> But, perhaps owing to the very light overview approach of the article, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a lot missing that this author would like to see. Though he describes
</I>&gt;<i> their plan as open, there is no place on the AfH web site where we can
</I>&gt;<i> publicly see the very important &quot;Rebuilding 101 Manual&quot; and &quot;Earthquake
</I>&gt;<i> Resistant Housing Manual&quot; mentioned as key information for their program.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this may become available in the future. Haiti represents some big
</I>&gt;<i> challenges in terms of applied building technology and it would have been
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to learn more about the specific building methods they
</I>&gt;<i> anticipate using.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Haiti is extremely poor in natural resources and has long relied heavily on
</I>&gt;<i> imported construction materials -which is one of the reasons so much housing
</I>&gt;<i> was marginal to begin with given the long history of extreme poverty. Much
</I>&gt;<i> of the landscape is quite denuded, topsoils are thin, and the usual earth
</I>&gt;<i> compositions needed for the earthen building methods common to relief
</I>&gt;<i> efforts today may not be available. So the choice of building technology and
</I>&gt;<i> its relation to local industrial potential is key to the overall recovery
</I>&gt;<i> strategy and its ability to rebuild economic infrastructures as well as
</I>&gt;<i> houses. It would be interesting to learn more on their plans for dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with this unique situation. Island nations are expected to become
</I>&gt;<i> particularly vulnerable to natural disaster in the near future given the
</I>&gt;<i> impacts of Global Warming and many share similar resources challenges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This author was thinking about this very topic recently, wondering what
</I>&gt;<i> building technologies offered the most potential in Haiti for use of
</I>&gt;<i> indigenous materials and the establishment of local industry to support
</I>&gt;<i> them. If typical earthen construction methods -compressed earth block in
</I>&gt;<i> particular- are not practical the options for low cost housing become
</I>&gt;<i> extremely limited since so few other locally produced materials may be
</I>&gt;<i> available. But there are some interesting -albeit perhaps a bit unusual-
</I>&gt;<i> options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In collaboration with Micheal Bauwens or the P2P Foundation and Agatino
</I>&gt;<i> Rizzo of City Left, this author recently worked on a transitional housing
</I>&gt;<i> concept for the earthquake struck region of Abruzzo Italy based on the
</I>&gt;<i> repurposing of shipping containers. (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.presstletter.com/articolo.asp?articolo=2239">http://www.presstletter.com/articolo.asp?articolo=2239</A>) Like much of the
</I>&gt;<i> Caribbean, Haiti may already have a small local industry for the repurposing
</I>&gt;<i> of these containers -left-over from its very trade-dependent economy- for
</I>&gt;<i> business and housing. Could this be built upon? We tend to think of
</I>&gt;<i> cargotecture as something of a recent novelty but, in fact, these have been
</I>&gt;<i> repurposed for housing in poorer nations for about as long as they're
</I>&gt;<i> existed. No doubt, container structures are already in use to some degree in
</I>&gt;<i> the current relief efforts, most likely in the role of transportable
</I>&gt;<i> buildings brought by relief agencies themselves. But these expensive prefab
</I>&gt;<i> structures would not be a practical basis of housing as they are in this
</I>&gt;<i> context. What would be needed is a strategy for the reuse of containers as a
</I>&gt;<i> raw material for a local industry. With our Abruzzo proposal, we suggested
</I>&gt;<i> the development of a modular building system based on prefab -but not
</I>&gt;<i> all-inclusive- elements that could be used in innumerable combinations as
</I>&gt;<i> building blocks for structures collaboratively designed by communities
</I>&gt;<i> themselves in peer-communication process. These basic buildings elements
</I>&gt;<i> were infinitely customizable and reusable to accommodate local adaptation
</I>&gt;<i> over the expected protracted recovery period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Europe an already well established commercial container prefab industry
</I>&gt;<i> made this strategy quite logical but the heaviness and bulkiness of whole
</I>&gt;<i> container modules is something of a liability where there is a lack of heavy
</I>&gt;<i> equipment to transport and manipulate them. In the context of Haiti, this
</I>&gt;<i> may limit this application to the very close proximity of the chief source
</I>&gt;<i> of this raw material -port areas- though the availability of economical
</I>&gt;<i> military-type modular Container-Lift-Transport units might make a big
</I>&gt;<i> difference here. But can we go a step further in the notion of the container
</I>&gt;<i> as raw material? Can we turn the material of the container into a more
</I>&gt;<i> easily transported collection of parts as apposed to a whole unit module?
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, the variability in container structural composition within the
</I>&gt;<i> unit module standards is an issue, but there are some interesting
</I>&gt;<i> precedents. It's not uncommon in the Middle East and Africa to see container
</I>&gt;<i> doors removed from containers and repurposed whole as gates for the common
</I>&gt;<i> walled compound home designs using earthen construction. (anyone with recent
</I>&gt;<i> military experience in the regions is probably very familiar with these) How
</I>&gt;<i> else might we 'de-part' a container into reusable structural components?
</I>&gt;<i> What is their architectural potential? What sort of building industry might
</I>&gt;<i> one develop from this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though container 'cast offs' may be relatively plentiful in a region so
</I>&gt;<i> heavily reliant on marine trade, they are still not a truly indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> material. What options might the region have for something that is more
</I>&gt;<i> wholly locally produced? A couple of interesting possibilities have occurred
</I>&gt;<i> to me. Though typical earthen construction techniques may not be practical
</I>&gt;<i> given the nature of the local raw material, one interesting exception is the
</I>&gt;<i> SuperAdobe technique developed by the late Nadir Khalili and the CalEarth
</I>&gt;<i> organization. This technique is more indifferent to earth composition and
</I>&gt;<i> can actually use sand as a building material. In Haiti there already exists
</I>&gt;<i> an industry for the production of hessian bags for the coffee industry that
</I>&gt;<i> could be turned to production of continuous tubing for SuperAdobe
</I>&gt;<i> construction purposes. However, there is still a need for a cement binder
</I>&gt;<i> for SuperAdobe and this is an imported material. But a promising alternative
</I>&gt;<i> may be found in the cultivation of hemp production which would neatly
</I>&gt;<i> produce both raw materials for the bag tubing and siliconized hemp chard
</I>&gt;<i> which can be used to produce Isochanvre; a crude geopolymer cement and
</I>&gt;<i> plaster alternative developed in France through reverse engineering of
</I>&gt;<i> ancient Roman concretes. So there would seem to be potential here for a
</I>&gt;<i> Haitian construction industry based completely on indigenous materials that
</I>&gt;<i> builds upon already established industries. The chief catches with this
</I>&gt;<i> notion are that there are still some issues with seismic resistance for
</I>&gt;<i> SuperAdobe structures that may limit their individual scale and, unless
</I>&gt;<i> someone has already experimented with this in the past, Isochanvre-based
</I>&gt;<i> SuperAdobe is an untested material and there may not be a lot of time for
</I>&gt;<i> its research.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, in the future Architecture for Humanity will share more
</I>&gt;<i> information with the public as to the specific architecture they employ in
</I>&gt;<i> their recovery plans and we can see what solutions they've arrived at for
</I>&gt;<i> the unique Haitian situation. It will be interesting to see what they
</I>&gt;<i> devise, given the great challenges.
