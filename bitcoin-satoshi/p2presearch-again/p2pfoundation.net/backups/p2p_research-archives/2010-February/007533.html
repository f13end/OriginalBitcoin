Canada &amp; Venezuela

The government of Hugo Chavez was correct last week when a representative
said Ottawa supports &quot;coup plotters&quot; and &quot;destabilizers&quot; in Venezuela.

But it's not because Harper is of the &quot;ultra right&quot; as suggested. In fact,
both Liberal and Conservative governments have tacitly supported the U.S.
campaign to replace the government of Venezuela.

In April 2002 a military coup took Chavez prisoner and imposed an unelected
government. While most Latin American leaders condemned the coup, Canadian
diplomats who were working under the direction of a Liberal government were
silent.

It was particularly hypocritical of Ottawa to accept the coup. Only a year
earlier, during the Summit of the Americas in Qu&#233;bec City, Jean Chr&#233;tien's
Liberals made a big show of the new Organization of American States (OAS)
&quot;democracy clause&quot; that was supposed to commit the hemisphere to electoral
democracy.

Eight months after the coup, the Venezuelan opposition renewed its campaign
to oust Chavez by sabotaging the oil industry and closing their businesses.
In the midst of the upheaval, Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham simply
asked both sides to resume dialogue, never stating Canada's opposition to
any government that gained power undemocratically. But, growing social
reforms in Venezuela increased Ottawa's ire. While the NDP called on the
Liberal government to invite Chavez for an official visit, the president was
passed over in favour of the leader of a U.S.-funded opposition group.

In January 2005, Paul Martin's Liberals invited Maria Corina Machado to
Ottawa. Machado was in charge of S&#250;mate, an organization at the forefront of
anti-Chavez political campaigns. Just prior to her invitation, in August
2004, S&#250;mate led the unsuccessful campaign to recall Chavez through a
referendum. Before that, Machado's name appeared on a list of people who
endorsed the 2002 coup, for which she faced charges of treason. She denied
signing the now-infamous &quot;Carmona decree&quot; that dissolved the National
Assembly and Supreme Court and suspended the elected government, the
Attorney General, Comptroller General, governors as well as mayors elected
during Chavez's administration. It also annulled land reforms and increases
in royalties paid by oil companies.

Canada also helped finance S&#250;mate, giving the group $22,000 in 2005-06.
Minister of International Cooperation Jos&#233; Verner explained that &quot;Canada
considered S&#250;mate to be an experienced NGO with the capability to promote
respect for democracy, particularly a free and fair electoral process in
Venezuela.&quot;

In October 2006 Canada sided with the U.S. in a diplomatic row with
Venezuela over the Western Hemisphere's Security Council seat. The U.S. and
Canada backed the notorious human rights violator Guatemala, while Venezuela
was seen as a protest vote by developing countries fed up with U.S. policy.
When Chavez was reelected with 63 percent of the vote two months later, 32
members of the OAS supported a resolution to congratulate him on the
victory. Ottawa was the only nation to join Washington in opposing a message
of congratulations for an election win monitored by the OAS.

Just after Chavez's reelection U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Hemispheric Affairs, Thomas Shannon, called Canada &quot;a country that can
deliver messages that can resonate in ways that sometimes our messages don't
for historical or psychological reasons.&quot; Seven months later, Harper toured
South America, &quot;to show [the region] that Canada functions and that it can
be a better model than Venezuela,&quot; in the words of a high-level Foreign
Affairs official. During the trip, Harper and his entourage made a number of
comments critical of the Venezuelan government.

Last April Harper responded to a question regarding Venezuela by saying, &quot;I
don't take any of these rogue states lightly.&quot; A month earlier, the Prime
Minister referred to the far right Colombian government as a valuable &quot;ally&quot;
in a hemisphere full of &quot;serious enemies and opponents.&quot;

The most recent example of Ottawa supporting Venezuela's opposition took
place at the end of January. After meeting only with opposition figures
during a trip to Venezuela Peter Kent, minister of state for the Americas,
said: &quot;Democratic space within Venezuela has been shrinking and in this
election year, Canada is very concerned about the rights of all Venezuelans
to participate in the democratic process.&quot;

(Venezuela's ambassador to the OAS, Roy Chaderton Matos, responded: &quot;I am
talking of a Canada governed by an ultra right that closed its Parliament
for various months to (evade) an investigation over the violation of human
rights - I am talking about torture and assassinations - by its soldiers in
Afghanistan.&quot;)

Ottawa' s antagonism towards Chavez is motivated by a desire to support
Washington, but is also being driven by particular Canadian business
interests. In 2001 the Venezuelan National Guard seized Vancouver-based
Vanessa Ventures' gold project. According to the Globe and Mail, this
prompted the company to spend &quot;seven years and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in legal fees on nearly a dozen legal proceedings before
unsympathetic Venezuelan courts to claim more than $181-million it says it
invested in the mining camp.&quot;

In early 2007 Venezuela forced private oil companies to become minority
partners with the state oil company, prompting Calgary based Petro-Canada to
sell its portion of an oil project. And, reported the National Post:&quot;Gold
Reserve Inc. has seen its share price get punished by the uncertainty
surrounding mining projects in that country and the possibility that Hugo
Chavez's government will take over their deposits.&quot;

But the move that received the most attention from the business press was
the government's legal maneuvers over the Las Cristinas gold mine,
Venezuela's largest gold deposit. The stock of Toronto-based Crystallex,
which had the rights to operate Las Cristinas, plunged and in December 2008,
Reuters reported: &quot;Crystallex International filed a letter with Venezuela's
government claiming that the country's denial of approvals to mine the Las
Cristinas gold deposit goes against a treaty between Canada and Venezuela.&quot;

Despite his company not owning any properties in Venezuela, the head of
Barrick Gold, Peter Munk, has repeatedly attacked Chavez. In a August 2007
letter to the Financial Times headlined &quot;Stop Chavez' Demagoguery Before it
is Too Late&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Your editorial 'Chavez in Control' was way too
benign a characterization of a dangerous dictator - the latest of a type who
takes over a nation through the democratic process, and then perverts or
abolishes it to perpetuate his own power &#8230; aren't we ignoring the lessons of
history and forgetting that the dictators Hitler, Mugabe, Pol Pot and so on
became heads of state by a democratic process? &#8230; autocratic demagogues in
the Chavez mode get away with [it] until their countries become totalitarian
regimes like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or Slobadan Milosevic's Serbia
&#8230; Let us not give President Chavez a chance to do the same step-by- step
transformation of Venezuela.&quot;

Munk, among Embassy magazine's &quot;Top 50 People Influencing Canadian Foreign
Policy&quot;, sees Venezuela's reforms as a threat to his profit-making
possibilities and as an example that might be replicated elsewhere. It is a
view likely held by most of Canada's foreign focused business community,
especially in the resource sector.

Over the past two decades there has been an explosion in Canadian miners in
the region. Canadian companies now control some 1,300 concessions in Latin
America. These corporations have benefited from the privatization of
state-run mining companies, opening the sector to foreign investment and
reductions in royalty rates. Growing calls for increased state control over
extractive industries are a major threat to Canadian miners. And these are
almost always among the first reforms pushed by those resisting
neoliberalism. Put simply, Canadian miners profit-making in the region is
closely tied to maintaining and expanding 'free' market capitalism.

Home to the majority of the world's mining companies, as well as many oil
and gas firms, Canadian capital is highly dependent on an extreme version of
'free' market capitalism. In light of this reality, is it a surprise that
Ottawa -Liberal and Conservative governments alike - has worked to undermine
the government in the region most actively resisting neoliberalism?
