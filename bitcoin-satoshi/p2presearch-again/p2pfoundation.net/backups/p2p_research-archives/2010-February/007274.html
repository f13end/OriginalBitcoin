<PRE>*&quot;secondly, it's a good habit to check online before judging people.&quot;*

Hence confirming: not a poet, not writing from experience, therefore
positing abstract self.  As I quite rightly stated at the start.

I judge arguments, not people.  You're the one who started personalising
things.

*&quot;this is an approach that doesn't exclude difference.&quot;*

Perhaps - but the exclusion of difference arises from the
argument-from-experience approach.  Your last email effectively dismissed
everything I said, on the grounds that it was too abstract whereas yours was
experiential and down-to-earth.  I have exposed this as an ideological
fallacy.  It remains an ideological fallacy, however annoyed you get.

*&quot;I didn't deny for one moment the concreteness and
legitimacy and freedom of everybody else to do what they want.&quot;*

Do I need to explain the idea of logical implications?

Your first post in this thread stated that time is inherently scarce and
that people have to earn a living.  The imposition of an entire social
system is implicit in these statements.

And if you don't like being ideology-critiqued, maybe you should think twice
before getting people's backs up by calling them names like 'zealot'.   :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I said I am being concrete. It doesnt' esclude ideological.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can choose to submerge yourself in this ideological
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performativity and refuse to question its basic assumptions and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perspectival biases - but by doing so, you lose the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engage with difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all. When it comes to copyright (that's the only part of &quot;IP&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> meant to talk about when I stepped in this thread and yes, not making
</I>&gt;<i> this clear from the beginning is my fault) my position is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - current copyright is terribly screwed up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - this said, copyright as compensation for _authors_ or _performers_
</I>&gt;<i>  for their consumption of a very limited resource, ie their own time,
</I>&gt;<i>  if they want such a compensation of course, is good and even needed,
</I>&gt;<i>  in many practical cases, to maximize production of useful/meaningful
</I>&gt;<i>  creative works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - as long as copyright lasts say ten years from publication and has
</I>&gt;<i>  quite a stricter scope than it has today
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is an approach that doesn't exclude difference. In a system like
</I>&gt;<i> this, the majority of works in any given field and moment would be in
</I>&gt;<i> the public domain (ie the opposite of what happens today), and
</I>&gt;<i> everybody could freely decide wether to keep full copyright, going CC
</I>&gt;<i> or just release directly in the public domain with much less
</I>&gt;<i> consequences for society as a whole than it happens today. Aren't you
</I>&gt;<i> sure you aren't the one who wants to eliminate difference and go
</I>&gt;<i> monological, coercive and so on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The challenge is to realise that other perspectives also come from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiences, immediacies, actual connections in the world...  that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indigenous shamans, autonomous social movement activists,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impoverished unsuccessful artists and people playing music in bars
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in their 'free' time all exist in the real world and that their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiences have just as much concreteness and legitimacy as your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only challenge here is for you to step down the pulpit and
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge that I didn't deny for one moment the concreteness and
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy and freedom of everybody else to do what they want. I do
</I>&gt;<i> accept difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You do mean an abstract self, because I very much doubt that you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have actually sat down for five days to 'research and test stuff'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and out of it written a poem for which you have received
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remuneration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe you do mean to not be taken seriously and be simply ignored
</I>&gt;<i> from now on. First of all, please note I said &quot;(e.g. poetry) OR&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;If it takes me, say, five full days to research and test stuff in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; order to write something that gives one million people emotions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (e.g. poetry) or, much more prosaically, teaches them in twenty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; minutes how to do something they need to do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> secondly, it's a good habit to check online before judging people. Had
</I>&gt;<i> you bothered to use a search engine, you'd have found and read why I
</I>&gt;<i> said &quot;abstract and theoretical my foot&quot; in less time than it took you
</I>&gt;<i> to type this last message: <A HREF="http://mfioretti.com/">http://mfioretti.com</A>
