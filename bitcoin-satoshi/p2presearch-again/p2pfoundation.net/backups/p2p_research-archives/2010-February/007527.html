Thanks for the clarification.  There would certainly be advantages to
having a fairly secure customer base in the user community.

&gt;<i>  This could allow us to begin as a hybrid corporation similar to what

</I>
I can also see the appeal of expanding an enterprise into a
stakeholder coop, from the standpoint of a beleaguered and indebted
small businessman who trades the vagaries of enterpreneurial profit
for a steady supervisory wage, in return for some guarantee of
amortizing his debts and capital outlays.

OTOH, for those not already so saddled, I can see the attraction of
entering the field with low-capital and low-overhead methods that
don't carry a high burden of debt or risk, and taking a chance on
recouping all the short-term entrepreneurial profit.

&gt;<i>  &gt; The owner's prices would be driven down
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; to production cost through the automatic function of the market,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; without a lot of paperwork and administrative complications.

</I>&gt;<i>  One thing I've noticed about even pure* Capitalism is that it always
</I>&gt;<i>  requires more than one Physical Source to bring Profit down.  And even
</I>&gt;<i>  then there is Profit hidden in high wages and other requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But even if the Prices were identical in both systems, there would

</I>
Sure.  But as someone who works for a wage, I can see a problem from
the opposite direction.  Dominion over production, through getting to
play &quot;King for a day&quot; as consumer when you buy something, rings pretty
hollow when you have to go back to being a serf every time you punch
that time clock.  And most of us spend a lot more of our waking hours
working on somebody's clock than we do buying stuff.  I would still
argue that the main source of disempowerment for the consumer is legal
barriers to competition in meeting the needs of end users.  Most of
the stuff consumers object to in product design results from
proprietary design.
