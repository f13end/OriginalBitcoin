Unfortunately, I have no *direct* experience of any such ISP, so I
can't help you when it comes to price/cost details, but they do exist.
Two I have met online are Ninux, see <A HREF="http://stop.zona-m.net/node/47,">http://stop.zona-m.net/node/47,</A>
and the Catalonia WCN linked from that article. More exactly, Ninux is
still in the amateur/hacking phase, but WCN is already a reality, so
you should contact them directly to see *if* and how they fit with
your definition of community owned, and how their costs work.

&gt;<i> &gt; The only problem today is that most VPS offers are sized for big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; websites, not for this kind of needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could these be community owned?
</I>
Maybe I must introduce a bit of terminology here, in order to
answer. A professional, reliable datacenter is a big, big room with
state of the art air conditioning, redundant power supply and internet
backbone connections, fire alarm... and 24/7 onsite professionals to
keep it running, replace faulty hw components asap etc... Inside those
big rooms there are tenths or hundreds of racks, each carrying tenths
of special computers. &quot;special&quot; means &quot;made with higher quality parts,
and shaped to be packed as densely as possible&quot;.

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtual computer, that is a purely
software environment remotely accessible, which &quot;looks&quot; and works like
a normal computer. Companies set up a datacenter as above, then
partition each of the physical microprocessors in those special
computers to work as N different, totally independent VPSs and then
&quot;rent&quot; each of them to a different customer. The customer can run
inside the VPS any software he or she wants, including web servers,
email servers, whatever.

A VPS can certainly be &quot;community owned&quot;, and so can a datacenter. The
problem today is that there is little or no demand for &quot;community
owned&quot; datacenters aimed just to provide VPSs for &quot;personal server&quot;
usage, at least not enough to make them economically affordable.

I am not sure if I answered your question, but I hope what I wrote
will be helpful to ask more specific answers :-)

&gt;<i> Could a Cloud be Community Owned?
</I>
Yes, I think, but the real question is &quot;why&quot;? First you should define
exactly what you mean by &quot;cloud&quot;, next which communities really need a
&quot;cloud&quot; and why, why is a &quot;cloud&quot; better than a &quot;not-cloud&quot;
solution...

&gt;<i> What should a Community do with Profit?
</I>
this is a general question, which has nothing to do with clouds and
which I'm not qualified to answer, I think. I suggest that you simply
ignore it in the context of this thread. The point here is *if* you
need a cloud in the first place, then *if* you really need it *if* you can build or buy
your very own one.
