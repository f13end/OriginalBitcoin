*GREENING THE ECONOMY*


*This is the first ever Green Economics Conference in Italy. The Green
Economics Institute is very active in Italy this year, writing books for the
Italian Government, and also providing events in several parts of Italy from
the Italian Alps down to the Sicilian area. Venice is particularly hard hit
by climate change and this conference is an attempt to provide solutions
that various parts of Italy are experiencing under global environmental
change.*

*We had our own delegation to the Copenhangen Climate Conference and will be
going to the COP16 Mexico Summit and the conference will prepare ideas to
take to Mexico.*

*The conference will also focus on Green Economics and Green Jobs.*


*Climate change*

The Green Economics Institute has been lucky enough to lead a delegation to
the Copenhagen Conference on climate change. Assessing how Kyoto has worked
up to now and suggestions for changes and for the next few years. How will
businesses have to adapt? What are the solutions to food and fuel issues?
What are the implications of climate change and sea level rise for the
economy of Venice? What can we learn from the experience and case study of
Venice?


*Subjects the conference will cover amongst others*

Legal Aspects of Environmental Law and climate change implications, gender
equity, environmental science, costs of climate change, costs of
biodiversity loss, how to asses an project from an environmental point of
view, environmental impact assessment, The Green New Deal, switching to
renewable energies, energy security and availability, Global Institutional
issues and governance, Global corporation and corporate social
responsibility, whole life costing, water management, water scarcity, Hydro
electric power, eco taxes, carbon taxes, lower carbon economies,poverty,
equity, aid, international trade and development, slow travel and green
transport, green accounting, resource management, green procurement,
development economics, recycling. How to run a green economy. Gender and
environmental and social justice discourses.

It will discuss Green solutions to the global financial crisis, the global
ecological crisis, the global biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis,
green construction and green planning issues, and green tourism.

It will also introduce and explain the different strands of environmental,
and green economics newly emerging disciplines in economics

*What is green economics? Progress towards a definition*

As a fast moving, visionary and topical field, it is always necessary to
continue to ask this fundamental question; something orthodox economics
fails to do, which has lead to the distortion of its aims and its
disjointedness with the real world.

So what are the latest research findings and discussions on this topic?


*Green Jobs and Green Economics solutions to the current economic crisis*

The current crisis provides the opportunity to align consumption with
resources and rebalance towards services rather than goods. How can we act
on the new opportunities the crisis provides? What are the short term and
long term solutions? What is the future of financial markets? &#8211; Ethical
investments? Many of our speakers are working on the Green Jobs Programme
and will present its latest findings.

This conference is part of the world's leading conference series in green
economics. Internationally-renowned composite, multidisciplinary scientists,
economists, campaigners, policy makers and directors, professors, social
scientists and researchers from all over the globe continue to attend this
very popular series, to present their frontier research findings and to keep
up to date with latest achievements and developments in this fast moving,
leading, and topical field.

Green economics views the current downturn as a clash between ecology and
economy and argues that the commodity instability is a symptom of the
exhaustion of natural resources. The markets are correctly reflecting that
and are indicating that traditional economics instruments and derivatives
are no longer working, and new methods of creating a natural economics of
abundance need to be urgently developed.

The world has changed and green economics is a school of economics that is
comfortable with long term-ism, equity, climate issues, biodiversity costs
and poverty prevention. Green economics has been waiting to take on the
mantle and that time has now arrived!

We look forward to welcoming you to Venice, one of the most beautiful cities
in the world with its famous, outstanding and atmospheric conference
facilities, excellent travel connections and accommodation. *

The Center for Thematic Environmental Networks (TEN) is a Center for
education and research in the fields of environment and sustainable
development.

TEN Center promotes the exchange of knowledge and information on the
environmental field and offers tools and supplementary approaches in order
to solve environmental issues with specific reference to sustainable
development.

*TEN Center*

   1.

   promotes education and advanced training programs on sustainable
   development and environmental management;
   2.

   develops research activities on the main areas of environmental
   protection, with specific focus on developing countries;
   3.

   hosts initiatives which provide a meeting platform for the competent

European countries. The aim is to augment and improve the capabilities of
policy-makers and to facilitate knowledge transfer in order to promote
sustainable environmental, social and economic policies.

Since 2002, TEN has also coordinated an EU-endorsed research network on

guidelines to deal with the problem using modern technologies and
coordinating studies in European Union countries.
