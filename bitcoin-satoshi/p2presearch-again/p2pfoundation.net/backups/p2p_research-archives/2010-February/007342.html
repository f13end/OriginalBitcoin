<PRE>Great article...and more evidence for the inevitability of open.  I am a
multi-year BOINC user on the Cure Diabetes team of the protein modelling
experiment.  One of the best commons I know of.

</I>&gt;<i> The Democratising of Science: Research in the p2p age &amp; Why the climate
</I>&gt;<i> email hack may turn out to be a good thing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The hacking of emails written by scientists at the Climate Research Unit
</I>&gt;<i> has produced lots of comment and copy about the efficacy of climate science
</I>&gt;<i> and seems to have done damage to the reputations of the scientists and
</I>&gt;<i> sciences involved. However the response to this incident &#8211; an opening up and
</I>&gt;<i> peering of science that should be the response to this incident, will
</I>&gt;<i> benefit us all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve always felt that science is in essence, quite a democratic idea &#8211; this
</I>&gt;<i> may seem the opposite of how some perceive scientists to be; cold, logical
</I>&gt;<i> and aloof people getting their perspective from laboratories far from the
</I>&gt;<i> real world. When I did science at school (and to be fair I was not that
</I>&gt;<i> great at it) the concept that you could do the experiments to find things
</I>&gt;<i> out for yourself rather than simply accepting what was written in the text
</I>&gt;<i> books was, well&#8230;punk. The scientific method has at its core some very
</I>&gt;<i> democratic principles: First is that when something is correct &#8211; it is so
</I>&gt;<i> because that&#8217;s what the evidence says and this is regardless of the status
</I>&gt;<i> of the person advocating and/or the view of society to the point being made.
</I>&gt;<i> When Copernicus suggested that the earth rotated around the sun, it made
</I>&gt;<i> those in power very unhappy &#8211; but the democracy of the evidence pushes the
</I>&gt;<i> point regardless of the discomfort of the Catholic Church. Second is that
</I>&gt;<i> you have to back your claims with both evidence and method &#8211; this in turn
</I>&gt;<i> drives transparency and peer-involvement. It is the essence of peer-review;
</I>&gt;<i> that others need to be able to see behind the curtain of your claims. This
</I>&gt;<i> is also a democratic principle because when making claims in science you
</I>&gt;<i> can&#8217;t rely on your position in society, your wealth or your power; you have
</I>&gt;<i> to lay bare the foundations of your ideas for inspection and in doing to
</I>&gt;<i> open them to challenge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now these are all lofty claims &#8211; the reality is often very different. The
</I>&gt;<i> scientific method has noble ideas and claims, yet where it meets human
</I>&gt;<i> nature, it often gets a little lost. Scientists are very human; they can,
</I>&gt;<i> and do, get things wrong. They can, and do, make mistakes &#8211; and then
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes try to cover-up those mistakes. Politics and not data can corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> findings either by influencing the process or burying unfavourable outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> This is both a limitation and the main point of these democratic ideals. A
</I>&gt;<i> limitation because it imposes by human flaws into how the system operates.
</I>&gt;<i> The main point, because the requirement to share method and data &#8211; to open
</I>&gt;<i> it up to your peers &#8211; is one of the ways we seek to iron out these flaws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is another process within science that is also important to
</I>&gt;<i> understand; it&#8217;s interpretation. When I was taught science in school we were
</I>&gt;<i> told that the idea behind the layout of an experimental write-up (abstract,
</I>&gt;<i> introduction, method, results, conclusion etc) was structured as such so
</I>&gt;<i> that anyone with a good grasp of language and maths could read it and
</I>&gt;<i> understand it. Again, this is another noble and democratic ideal that often
</I>&gt;<i> flounders in reality. Most areas of science are so complex that you need a
</I>&gt;<i> better grounding in the specific area than the paper&#8217;s introduction may
</I>&gt;<i> offer in order to set the correct context. The maths used in research has
</I>&gt;<i> developed significantly since Copernicus and are the methods available
</I>&gt;<i> require much more than basic maths to understand. As such most people
</I>&gt;<i> outside the field rely on an interpretor to locate important findings,
</I>&gt;<i> translate them into normal speech and summarise them in an accessible way &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> this function is most often done by the media. But just as scientists are
</I>&gt;<i> very human; they can, and do, get things wrong &#8211; so are journalists. They
</I>&gt;<i> can, and do, make mistakes &#8211; and then sometimes try to cover-up those
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes. The politics of a media outlet can and does corrupt findings
</I>&gt;<i> either by influencing the selection of reports and interviewees or by
</I>&gt;<i> twisting outcomes to that media outlet&#8217;s narrative into favourable shapes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is where the changes in communication technology come into the story.
</I>&gt;<i> First, science now has the opportunity to add many more peers into the
</I>&gt;<i> process; it is much easier than ever before to collaborate, exchange data
</I>&gt;<i> and ideas and discuss methods. We can all become peers; reviewing papers,
</I>&gt;<i> performing experiments. We can control for the problems in the complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> the process by aggregating resources and allowing people to focus on the
</I>&gt;<i> aspects that they are most equipped to do. An example of this is the
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">SETI at home</A> project &#8211; where people can aggregate their efforts in the search
</I>&gt;<i> for extraterrestrial intelligence. There are various levels of involvement
</I>&gt;<i> to the project from the most basic entry level of installing the software
</I>&gt;<i> (that uses downtime of people&#8217;s computers to analyse data) to assisting with
</I>&gt;<i> the development of the software itself (called BOINC). This is not a perfect
</I>&gt;<i> example of a fully democratic project for a number of reasons, for example
</I>&gt;<i> the code for BOINC is not open source and getting direct involvement with
</I>&gt;<i> the small handful of people coordinating the project working for Berkeley is
</I>&gt;<i> hard; but it is a start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second is that changes in communication technology allow much more scope
</I>&gt;<i> for scientists to communicate without the middleman of the media. We&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;<i> a proliferation of science blogging &#8211; some amazing while others are poor &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> but all allow direct communication on a level not possible a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> decades ago. This is key, because from my experience of chatting to
</I>&gt;<i> scientists they are not cold, logic, aloof people getting their world-view
</I>&gt;<i> from laboratories &#8211; but human beings who are totally engaged in the real
</I>&gt;<i> world &#8211; and know how messy it is. It is often the media interpretation of
</I>&gt;<i> their work that likes to cull the complexities to make the research fit an
</I>&gt;<i> ongoing narrative rather than report it, warts and all. Climate science is a
</I>&gt;<i> classic example of how this is happening in practice; while those unhappy
</I>&gt;<i> with the consensus on climate change have plenty of outlets and blogs &#8211; so
</I>&gt;<i> we see more and more and more of the scientists themselves weighing in to
</I>&gt;<i> speak directly with the public. Realclimate is a great example of this,
</I>&gt;<i> where not only do the climate scientists post articles about the latests
</I>&gt;<i> research and news items, but they also answer people&#8217;s questions in the
</I>&gt;<i> comments sections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However there is a downside to this; it does mean that people will try to
</I>&gt;<i> use the data to arrive at pre-determined positions that are unscientific.
</I>&gt;<i> They will do this anyway and so this is a danger, yes. It means people will
</I>&gt;<i> abuse the data and process in all sorts of horrendous ways to suit thier
</I>&gt;<i> political agendas. This is also a danger. Yet the same peer-principles that
</I>&gt;<i> allow this abuse are also the key to de-bunking it. Let me give an example &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). This is a datset of
</I>&gt;<i> temperature records from 1880 to the present day. It is simple to download
</I>&gt;<i> the data and then do as you will with it. One user published a paper that
</I>&gt;<i> purported to show that global warming was not happening as was claimed and
</I>&gt;<i> that the adjustments made were distorting the picture - while another
</I>&gt;<i> responded to this claim with another use of the same dataset displaying the
</I>&gt;<i> changes applied by the scientists to the raw data in a simple graph to show
</I>&gt;<i> how little change was going on. This graph is a simple and powerful refute
</I>&gt;<i> to the obfuscation of the facts and is all the more powerful because it was
</I>&gt;<i> developed independently of those who generate the data. Without this data
</I>&gt;<i> being available and without the peer analysis of the data, the claims and
</I>&gt;<i> counter claims lack any objective &#8211; and verifiable objectivity to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What has become apparent to me in the aftermath of the hacking incident is
</I>&gt;<i> that is that the broad response (but sadly not all) to the hacking has been
</I>&gt;<i> to both open-up the data and source-code being used to drive climate
</I>&gt;<i> science, but also to also force more scientists involved to spend more time
</I>&gt;<i> engaging with people in regard their work. It is going to be harder and
</I>&gt;<i> harder for scientists to keep data private by default &#8211; which is good &#8211; and
</I>&gt;<i> I would hope we move to a position where this is both best practice and the
</I>&gt;<i> norm.
