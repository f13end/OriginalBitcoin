I studiouly try to avoid using the cringe-indusing terms cloud computing

Yeah, me too, I was only on my first cup of coffee and was too lazy to think

You did operate a 19&quot; rack in your living space? Wasn't that a bit

on the noisy side? The only semi-silent racks are full of musical

gear.

 

I had two racks. It was a big loft, I'm pretty deaf anyway and during the
summer the swamp cooler was even louder.

ftp is still de rigeur in hardcore filesharing circles.

That's what high availability and failover are there for. In

case of p2p high availability there's very little complexity.

 

Most people don't have any sort of localized failover mechanisms let alone
UPS..

The problem is putting trust in the service provider, and also

in the availability of your data. It's a no-brainer that your

provider will snoop you out and rat on you, and that there's no

accountability is case of total loss of data, or even transient

unavailability (even it's a commercial service).

 

You answered your own question.

Home NAS appliances do all these things for you. You can of course

roll your own, using FreeNAS, OpenFiler, and EON Storage.

Admittedly a decent (=fast) NAS will set you back around 600 EUR sans
drives.

But baseline NAS (PogoPlug) starts at around 100 EUR. Slow but usable

NAS is around 300 EUR.

 

These are either too expensive\constrictive\too slow\ or unsecure at this
time.

 

&gt;<i> a mass PS revolution. Add to that the ISPs will not be happy with all that

&gt;<i> bandwidth moving about without any additional revenue from dedicated
</I>pipes.

 

We've got already people trying to evade deep packet inspection and Layer 7

traffic throttline, playing cat and mouse with the cheap providers (the

decent kind charge enough/provide decent data plans so that throttling

is unnecessary).

 

True, but even local ISPs keep the upstream bandwidth slow unless you pay up
for higher tier service with a block of IPs.

 

&gt;<i> Lastly, how would you index the information ? without an index, we go back

&gt;<i> to the really old days of BBS and word of mouth. The PS for the home is

I think it's a reality for many people already. Home NAS is a booming

market. 

 

All I've seen was eDonky as any type of index back in the day and it was
awful, but, that would be great if it really is happening now for
individuals .

 

&gt;<i> an outlandish wish though, perhaps in 10 years if there is still an

&gt;<i> as we know it.
</I>
 

There will be still the Internet as we know it, and even if I have to

roll my own. I run my own &quot;cloud&quot; (uck, ptui), have my own networks,

my ISP is nothing but a (hostile, untrusted) transport layer.

 

Rolling your own would involve unrolling your own wire house to house as
well if things get nasty J

&gt;<i> Final thought: a peer based internet using an ISP backbone is

certainlyYou can do very decent meshes with Level 3 switches and FTTC/FTTH.
The

reason it's not being done is mostly because policy is easier to roll

out to the network core. 

 

&gt;<i> possible and has been for a long time. Not only for sharing information
</I>but

&gt;<i> for sharing memory and CPU cycles to tackle complex calculations or 3D
</I>
 

You've got accounting and trust issues. You can't really sandbox code.

Because there's no p2p online currency (despite BitCoin &amp; Co) there's no

way to cash in on services rendered to the community.

 

Time.

 

&gt;<i> rendering. In addition, Peer based internet has other applications such as
</I>
&gt;<i> TOR (for annoniminity). VOIP hardening (Skype uses this) and bit torrent
</I>
 

Skype is a corporation, hence not really p2p. 

 

Their software layer is subscriber to subscriber.

yep

&gt;<i> in the realm of geeks at this time...still :-)
</I>
 

Geeks are always 10-20 years ahead of the mainstream. As Gibson said, the 

future's here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.

 

Very true, I guess we'll have to wait for the Hundredth Monkey threshold to
kick in.

 

Lastly, regarding Community owned ISPs:

These were all over the place less than 15 years ago in the US. Then they
were bought out or regulation had their pipes taken away.

VPS can most certainly be community owned. Better yet, purchase a dedicated
server that you own in a data center that does all the maintenance.
