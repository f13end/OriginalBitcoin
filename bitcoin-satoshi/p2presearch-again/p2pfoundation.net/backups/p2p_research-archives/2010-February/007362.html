Dear Chris, Michel, Massimo,

I'm sending this invitation of endorsement to you, should you think
you can attend (although the dates are quite close now) or at last
give your support to the initiative: <A HREF="http://www.degrowth.eu/">http://www.degrowth.eu/</A>



Dear friends,


We would like to request for your participation in the Second International
Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social
Equity, taking place in Barcelona from 26-29 of March 2010 and possibly
joining the NGO
committee related to it .


The degrowth movements and ideas have been spread and discussed within a
wide spectrum of society and gave rise to many meetings, conferences,
marches, books, political debates (also in the European
Parliament), magazines and the establishment of many local groups in France,
Spain and Italy. The degrowth perspective challenges the growth dogma that
blocks the evolution of society towards social and environmental justice.
Degrowth touches on the material and energy flow infrastructure, on economic
institutions, on the structures that maintain inequality, on advertising,
and
many other aspects of society. It therefore carries ideas which can be
applied
in various fields, including climate change, sustainable development,
international financial institutions, environmental protection, creating
links
between different campaigns.


The Barcelona event follows from the successful first conference on
degrowth, which took place in Paris in 2008 (see
<A HREF="http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/en/">http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/en/</A>). The Barcelona
conference will unite scientists and civil society organizations into
thinking about policy proposals and research priorities. While the
conference will include plenaries
with keynote speakers, its main component consists of working groups that
discuss and develop
concrete proposals and
report to the general assembly. Scientific
presentations on various
topic will be conducted in the
form of posters.


The contribution of civil society groups to the discussion, modeling and
development of the policy proposals is crucial. We believe that the ideas
and links developed within the working groups and the conference in general,
will be highly
relevant for your campaigns and work.


Thus we would like to invite you to:

- attend the conference; and/or

- support the conference by joining the NGO committee, related to it (this
implies
endorsing the conference objectives and providing advice around its
organization in a format and time suitable for you).


If you are unable to attend but willing to endorse the conference, we would
be grateful if you send us short statements or videos that represent your
stance regarding degrowth. These will be uploaded on the conference website
and
exhibited during the Barcelona event.


Please mind that due to funding limitation, we will not be able to cover
travel costs.


We would be grateful if you could send this invitation to other interested
organizations. More information about the conference can be found at:

*What is Degrowth ?*


Degrowth rests on the idea that achieving social justice and ecological
sustainability requires shrinking of the size of the economy in the
industrial countries or a reduction of the capacity to produce
and consume, done in a voluntary and participatory way. The transition to a
lower level of production, consumption and waste, implied by degrowth is not
meant to turn the growth fetish into a degrowth fetish. Degrowth is not a
goal
in itself, but transition path to social and environmental justice,
well-being
and ecological sustainability. It involves a range of concrete actions taken
at
the individual, collective and state level, based on a change of values and
shift away from profit-seeking as a single objective of production. Degrowth
is
also about democratization of society, about people rather than technology
deciding on the direction of societal evolution and about giving meaning to
human life which is not per se associated with conspicuous consumption and
materialism. Degrowth involves a challenge to the present economic
institutions, as well as a fundamental change in our way of thinking and
acting.
