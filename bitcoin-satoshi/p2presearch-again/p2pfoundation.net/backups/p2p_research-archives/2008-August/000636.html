</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Published: August 3, 2008
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One afternoon in the spring of 2006, for reasons unknown to those who
</I>&gt;<i> knew him, Mitchell Henderson, a seventh grader from Rochester, Minn.,
</I>&gt;<i> took a .22-caliber rifle down from a shelf in his parents' bedroom
</I>&gt;<i> closet and shot himself in the head. The next morning, Mitchell's
</I>&gt;<i> school assembled in the gym to begin mourning. His classmates created
</I>&gt;<i> a virtual memorial on MySpace and garlanded it with remembrances. One
</I>&gt;<i> wrote that Mitchell was &quot;an hero to take that shot, to leave us all
</I>&gt;<i> behind. God do we wish we could take it back. . . . &quot; Someone e-mailed
</I>&gt;<i> a clipping of Mitchell's newspaper obituary to MyDeathSpace.com, a Web
</I>&gt;<i> site that links to the MySpace pages of the dead. From MyDeathSpace,
</I>&gt;<i> Mitchell's page came to the attention of an Internet message board
</I>&gt;<i> known as /b/ and the &quot;trolls,&quot; as they have come to be called, who
</I>&gt;<i> dwell there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /b/ is the designated &quot;random&quot; board of 4chan.org, a group of message
</I>&gt;<i> boards that draws more than 200 million page views a month. A post
</I>&gt;<i> consists of an image and a few lines of text. Almost everyone posts as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;anonymous.&quot; In effect, this makes /b/ a panopticon in reverse &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> nobody can see anybody, and everybody can claim to speak from the
</I>&gt;<i> center. The anonymous denizens of 4chan's other boards &#8212; devoted to
</I>&gt;<i> travel, fitness and several genres of pornography &#8212; refer to the
</I>&gt;<i> /b/-dwellers as &quot;/b/tards.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Measured in terms of depravity, insularity and traffic-driven
</I>&gt;<i> turnover, the culture of /b/ has little precedent. /b/ reads like the
</I>&gt;<i> inside of a high-school bathroom stall, or an obscene telephone party
</I>&gt;<i> line, or a blog with no posts and all comments filled with slang that
</I>&gt;<i> you are too old to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something about Mitchell Henderson struck the denizens of /b/ as
</I>&gt;<i> funny. They were especially amused by a reference on his MySpace page
</I>&gt;<i> to a lost iPod. Mitchell Henderson, /b/ decided, had killed himself
</I>&gt;<i> over a lost iPod. The &quot;an hero&quot; meme was born. Within hours, the
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous multitudes were wrapping the tragedy of Mitchell's death in
</I>&gt;<i> absurdity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone hacked Henderson's MySpace page and gave him the face of a
</I>&gt;<i> zombie. Someone placed an iPod on Henderson's grave, took a picture
</I>&gt;<i> and posted it to /b/. Henderson's face was appended to dancing iPods,
</I>&gt;<i> spinning iPods, hardcore porn scenes. A dramatic re-enactment of
</I>&gt;<i> Henderson's demise appeared on YouTube, complete with shattered iPod.
</I>&gt;<i> The phone began ringing at Mitchell's parents' home. &quot;It sounded like
</I>&gt;<i> kids,&quot; remembers Mitchell's father, Mark Henderson, a 44-year-old I.T.
</I>&gt;<i> executive. &quot;They'd say, 'Hi, this is Mitchell, I'm at the cemetery.'
</I>&gt;<i> 'Hi, I've got Mitchell's iPod.' 'Hi, I'm Mitchell's ghost, the front
</I>&gt;<i> door is locked. Can you come down and let me in?' &quot; He sighed. &quot;It
</I>&gt;<i> really got to my wife.&quot; The calls continued for a year and a half.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the late 1980s, Internet users adopted the word &quot;troll&quot; to denote
</I>&gt;<i> someone who intentionally disrupts online communities. Early trolling
</I>&gt;<i> was relatively innocuous, taking place inside of small, single-topic
</I>&gt;<i> Usenet groups. The trolls employed what the M.I.T. professor Judith
</I>&gt;<i> Donath calls a &quot;pseudo-na&#239;ve&quot; tactic, asking stupid questions and
</I>&gt;<i> seeing who would rise to the bait. The game was to find out who would
</I>&gt;<i> see through this stereotypical newbie behavior, and who would fall for
</I>&gt;<i> it. As one guide to trolldom puts it, &quot;If you don't fall for the joke,
</I>&gt;<i> you get to be in on it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today the Internet is much more than esoteric discussion forums. It is
</I>&gt;<i> a mass medium for defining who we are to ourselves and to others.
</I>&gt;<i> Teenagers groom their MySpace profiles as intensely as their hair;
</I>&gt;<i> escapists clock 50-hour weeks in virtual worlds, accumulating gold for
</I>&gt;<i> their online avatars. Anyone seeking work or love can expect to be
</I>&gt;<i> Googled. As our emotional investment in the Internet has grown, the
</I>&gt;<i> stakes for trolling &#8212; for provoking strangers online &#8212; have risen.
</I>&gt;<i> Trolling has evolved from ironic solo skit to vicious group hunt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Lulz&quot; is how trolls keep score. A corruption of &quot;LOL&quot; or &quot;laugh out
</I>&gt;<i> loud,&quot; &quot;lulz&quot; means the joy of disrupting another's emotional
</I>&gt;<i> equilibrium. &quot;Lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their
</I>&gt;<i> computer 2,000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh,&quot; said
</I>&gt;<i> one ex-troll who, like many people I contacted, refused to disclose
</I>&gt;<i> his legal identity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another troll explained the lulz as a quasi-thermodynamic exchange
</I>&gt;<i> between the sensitive and the cruel: &quot;You look for someone who is full
</I>&gt;<i> of it, a real blowhard. Then you exploit their insecurities to get an
</I>&gt;<i> insane amount of drama, laughs and lulz. Rules would be simple: 1. Do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever it takes to get lulz. 2. Make sure the lulz is widely
</I>&gt;<i> distributed. This will allow for more lulz to be made. 3. The game is
</I>&gt;<i> never over until all the lulz have been had.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /b/ is not all bad. 4chan has tried (with limited success) to police
</I>&gt;<i> itself, using moderators to purge child porn and eliminate calls to
</I>&gt;<i> disrupt other sites. Among /b/'s more interesting spawn is Anonymous,
</I>&gt;<i> a group of masked pranksters who organized protests at Church of
</I>&gt;<i> Scientology branches around the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the logic of lulz extends far beyond /b/ to the anonymous message
</I>&gt;<i> boards that seem to be springing up everywhere. Two female Yale Law
</I>&gt;<i> School students have filed a suit against pseudonymous users who
</I>&gt;<i> posted violent fantasies about them on AutoAdmit, a college-admissions
</I>&gt;<i> message board. In China, anonymous nationalists are posting death
</I>&gt;<i> threats against pro-Tibet activists, along with their names and home
</I>&gt;<i> addresses. Technology, apparently, does more than harness the wisdom
</I>&gt;<i> of the crowd. It can intensify its hatred as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jason Fortuny might be the closest thing this movement of anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> provocateurs has to a spokesman. Thirty-two years old, he works
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;typical Clark Kent I.T.&quot; freelance jobs &#8212; Web design, programming &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> but his passion is trolling, &quot;pushing peoples' buttons.&quot; Fortuny
</I>&gt;<i> frames his acts of trolling as &quot;experiments,&quot; sociological inquiries
</I>&gt;<i> into human behavior. In the fall of 2006, he posted a hoax ad on
</I>&gt;<i> Craigslist, posing as a woman seeking a &quot;str8 brutal dom muscular
</I>&gt;<i> male.&quot; More than 100 men responded. Fortuny posted their names,
</I>&gt;<i> pictures, e-mail and phone numbers to his blog, dubbing the expos&#233;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the Craigslist Experiment.&quot; This made Fortuny the most prominent
</I>&gt;<i> Internet villain in America until November 2007, when his fame was
</I>&gt;<i> eclipsed by the Megan Meier MySpace suicide. Meier, a 13-year-old
</I>&gt;<i> Missouri girl, hanged herself with a belt after receiving cruel
</I>&gt;<i> messages from a boy she'd been flirting with on MySpace. The boy was
</I>&gt;<i> not a real boy, investigators say, but the fictional creation of Lori
</I>&gt;<i> Drew, the mother of one of Megan's former friends. Drew later said she
</I>&gt;<i> hoped to find out whether Megan was gossiping about her daughter. The
</I>&gt;<i> story &#8212; respectable suburban wife uses Internet to torment teenage
</I>&gt;<i> girl &#8212; was a media sensation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny's Craigslist Experiment deprived its subjects of more than
</I>&gt;<i> just privacy. Two of them, he says, lost their jobs, and at least one,
</I>&gt;<i> for a time, lost his girlfriend. Another has filed an
</I>&gt;<i> invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Fortuny in an Illinois court.
</I>&gt;<i> After receiving death threats, Fortuny meticulously scrubbed his real
</I>&gt;<i> address and phone number from the Internet. &quot;Anyone who knows who and
</I>&gt;<i> where you are is a security hole,&quot; he told me. &quot;I own a gun. I have an
</I>&gt;<i> escape route. If someone comes, I'm ready.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While reporting this article, I did everything I could to verify the
</I>&gt;<i> trolls' stories and identities, but I could never be certain. After
</I>&gt;<i> all, I was examining a subculture that is built on deception and
</I>&gt;<i> delights in playing with the media. If I had doubts about whether
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny was who he said he was, he had the same doubts about me. I
</I>&gt;<i> first contacted Fortuny by e-mail, and he called me a few days later.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I checked you out,&quot; he said warily. &quot;You seem legitimate.&quot; We met in
</I>&gt;<i> person on a bright spring day at his apartment, on a forested slope in
</I>&gt;<i> Kirkland, Wash., near Seattle. He wore a T-shirt and sweat pants,
</I>&gt;<i> looking like an amiable freelancer on a Friday afternoon. He is thin,
</I>&gt;<i> with birdlike features and the etiolated complexion of one who works
</I>&gt;<i> in front of a screen. He'd been chatting with an online associate
</I>&gt;<i> about driving me blindfolded from the airport, he said. &quot;We decided it
</I>&gt;<i> would be too much work.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A flat-screen HDTV dominated Fortuny's living room, across from a
</I>&gt;<i> futon prepped with neatly folded blankets. This was where I would
</I>&gt;<i> sleep for the next few nights. As Fortuny picked up his cat and
</I>&gt;<i> settled into an Eames-style chair, I asked whether trolling hurt
</I>&gt;<i> people. &quot;I'm not going to sit here and say, 'Oh, God, please forgive
</I>&gt;<i> me!' so someone can feel better,&quot; Fortuny said, his calm voice
</I>&gt;<i> momentarily rising. The cat lay purring in his lap. &quot;Am I the bad guy?
</I>&gt;<i> Am I the big horrible person who shattered someone's life with some
</I>&gt;<i> information? No! This is life. Welcome to life. Everyone goes through
</I>&gt;<i> it. I've been through horrible stuff, too.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Like what?&quot; I asked. Sexual abuse, Fortuny said. When Jason was 5, he
</I>&gt;<i> said, he was molested by his grandfather and three other relatives.
</I>&gt;<i> Jason's mother later told me, too, that he was molested by his
</I>&gt;<i> grandfather. The last she heard from Jason was a letter telling her to
</I>&gt;<i> kill herself. &quot;Jason is a young man in a great deal of emotional
</I>&gt;<i> pain,&quot; she said, crying as she spoke. &quot;Don't be too harsh. He's still
</I>&gt;<i> my son.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the days after the Megan Meier story became public, Lori Drew and
</I>&gt;<i> her family found themselves in the trolls' crosshairs. Their personal
</I>&gt;<i> information &#8212; e-mail addresses, satellite images of their home, phone
</I>&gt;<i> numbers &#8212; spread across the Internet. One of the numbers led to a
</I>&gt;<i> voice-mail greeting with the gleeful words &quot;I did it for the lulz.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Anonymous malefactors made death threats and hurled a brick through
</I>&gt;<i> the kitchen window. Then came the Megan Had It Coming blog. Supposedly
</I>&gt;<i> written by one of Megan's classmates, the blog called Megan a &quot;drama
</I>&gt;<i> queen,&quot; so unstable that Drew could not be blamed for her death.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Killing yourself over a MySpace boy? Come on!!! I mean yeah your fat
</I>&gt;<i> so you have to take what you can get but still nobody should kill
</I>&gt;<i> themselves over it.&quot; In the third post the author revealed herself as
</I>&gt;<i> Lori Drew.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This post received more than 3,600 comments. Fox and CNN debated its
</I>&gt;<i> authenticity. But the Drew identity was another mask. In fact, Megan
</I>&gt;<i> Had It Coming was another Jason Fortuny experiment. He, not Lori Drew,
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny told me, was the blog's author. After watching him log onto
</I>&gt;<i> the site and add a post, I believed him. The blog was intended, he
</I>&gt;<i> says, to question the public's hunger for remorse and to challenge the
</I>&gt;<i> enforceability of cyberharassment laws like the one passed by Megan's
</I>&gt;<i> town after her death. Fortuny concluded that they were unenforceable.
</I>&gt;<i> The county sheriff's department announced it was investigating the
</I>&gt;<i> identity of the fake Lori Drew, but it never found Fortuny, who is not
</I>&gt;<i> especially worried about coming out now. &quot;What's he going to sue me
</I>&gt;<i> for?&quot; he asked. &quot;Leading on confused people? Why don't people
</I>&gt;<i> fact-check who this stuff is coming from? Why do they assume it's
</I>&gt;<i> true?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny calls himself &quot;a normal person who does insane things on the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet,&quot; and the scene at dinner later on the first day we spent
</I>&gt;<i> together was exceedingly normal, with Fortuny, his roommate Charles
</I>&gt;<i> and his longtime friend Zach trading stories at a sushi restaurant
</I>&gt;<i> nearby over sake and happy-hour gyoza. Fortuny flirted with our
</I>&gt;<i> waitress, showing her a cellphone picture of his cat. &quot;He commands you
</I>&gt;<i> to kill!&quot; he cackled. &quot;Do you know how many I've killed at his
</I>&gt;<i> command?&quot; Everyone laughed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny spent most of the weekend in his bedroom juggling several
</I>&gt;<i> windows on his monitor. One displayed a chat room run by Encyclopedia
</I>&gt;<i> Dramatica, an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore. It was
</I>&gt;<i> buzzing with news of an attack against the Epilepsy Foundation's Web
</I>&gt;<i> site. Trolls had flooded the site's forums with flashing images and
</I>&gt;<i> links to animated color fields, leading at least one photosensitive
</I>&gt;<i> user to claim that she had a seizure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WEEV: the whole posting flashing images to epileptics thing? over the line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HEPKITTEN: can someone plz tell me how doing something the admins
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally left enabled is hacking?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WEEV: it's hacking peoples unpatched brains. we have to draw a moral
</I>&gt;<i> line somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny disagreed. In his mind, subjecting epileptic users to flashing
</I>&gt;<i> lights was justified. &quot;Hacks like this tell you to watch out by
</I>&gt;<i> hitting you with a baseball bat,&quot; he told me. &quot;Demonstrating these
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;So the message is 'buy a helmet,' and the medium is a bat to the
</I>&gt;<i> head?&quot; I asked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No, it's like a pitcher telling a batter to put on his helmet by
</I>&gt;<i> beaning him from the mound. If you have this disease and you're on the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet, you need to take precautions.&quot; A few days later, he wrote
</I>&gt;<i> and posted a guide to safe Web surfing for epileptics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Sunday, Fortuny showed me an office building that once housed
</I>&gt;<i> Google programmers, and a low-slung modernist structure where
</I>&gt;<i> programmers wrote Halo 3, the best-selling video game. We ate muffins
</I>&gt;<i> at Terra Bite, a coffee shop founded by a Google employee where
</I>&gt;<i> customers pay whatever price they feel like. Kirkland seemed to pulse
</I>&gt;<i> with the easy money and optimism of the Internet, unaware of the
</I>&gt;<i> machinations of the troll on the hill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We walked on, to Starbucks. At the next table, middle-schoolers with
</I>&gt;<i> punk-rock haircuts feasted noisily on energy drinks and whipped cream.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny sipped a white-chocolate mocha. He proceeded to demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> his personal cure for trolling, the Theory of the Green Hair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You have green hair,&quot; he told me. &quot;Did you know that?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No,&quot; I said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why not?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I look in the mirror. I see my hair is black.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;That's uh, interesting. I guess you understand that you have green
</I>&gt;<i> hair about as well as you understand that you're a terrible reporter.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What do you mean? What did I do?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;That's a very interesting reaction,&quot; Fortuny said. &quot;Why didn't you
</I>&gt;<i> get so defensive when I said you had green hair?&quot; If I were certain
</I>&gt;<i> that I wasn't a terrible reporter, he explained, I would have laughed
</I>&gt;<i> the suggestion off just as easily. The willingness of trolling
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;victims&quot; to be hurt by words, he argued, makes them complicit, and
</I>&gt;<i> trolling will end as soon as we all get over it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Monday we drove to the mall. I asked Fortuny how he could troll me
</I>&gt;<i> if he so chose. He took out his cellphone. On the screen was a picture
</I>&gt;<i> of my debit card with the numbers clearly legible. I had left it in
</I>&gt;<i> plain view beside my laptop. &quot;I took this while you were out,&quot; he
</I>&gt;<i> said. He pressed a button. The picture disappeared. &quot;See? I just
</I>&gt;<i> deleted it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Craigslist Experiment, Fortuny reiterated, brought him troll fame
</I>&gt;<i> by accident. He was pleased with how the Megan Had It Coming blog
</I>&gt;<i> succeeded by design. As he described the intricacies of his plan &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> adding sympathetic touches to the fake classmate, making fake Lori
</I>&gt;<i> Drew a fierce defender of her own daughter, calibrating every detail
</I>&gt;<i> to the emotional register of his audience &#8212; he sounded not so much a
</I>&gt;<i> sociologist as a playwright workshopping a set of characters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You seem to know exactly how much you can get away with, and you
</I>&gt;<i> troll right up to that line,&quot; I said. &quot;Is there anything that can be
</I>&gt;<i> done on the Internet that shouldn't be done?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortuny was silent. In four days of conversation, this was the first
</I>&gt;<i> time he did not have an answer ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to think about it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sherrod DeGrippo, a 28-year-old Atlanta native who goes by the name
</I>&gt;<i> Girlvinyl, runs Encyclopedia Dramatica, the online troll archive. In
</I>&gt;<i> 2006, DeGrippo received an e-mail message from a well-known band of
</I>&gt;<i> trolls, demanding that she edit the entry about them on the
</I>&gt;<i> Encyclopedia Dramatica site. She refused. Within hours, the aggrieved
</I>&gt;<i> trolls hit the phones, bombarding her apartment with taxis, pizzas,
</I>&gt;<i> escorts and threats of rape and violent death. DeGrippo, alone and
</I>&gt;<i> terrified, sought counsel from a powerful friend. She called Weev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Weev, the troll who thought hacking the epilepsy site was immoral, is
</I>&gt;<i> legendary among trolls. He is said to have jammed the cellphones of
</I>&gt;<i> daughters of C.E.O.'s and demanded ransom from their fathers; he is
</I>&gt;<i> also said to have trashed his enemies' credit ratings. Better
</I>&gt;<i> documented are his repeated assaults on LiveJournal, an online diary
</I>&gt;<i> site where he himself maintains a personal blog. Working with a group
</I>&gt;<i> of fellow hackers and trolls, he once obtained access to thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> user accounts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I first met Weev in an online chat room that I visited while staying
</I>&gt;<i> at Fortuny's house. &quot;I hack, I ruin, I make piles of money,&quot; he
</I>&gt;<i> boasted. &quot;I make people afraid for their lives.&quot; On the phone that
</I>&gt;<i> night, Weev displayed a misanthropy far harsher than Fortuny's.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Trolling is basically Internet eugenics,&quot; he said, his voice pitching
</I>&gt;<i> up like a jet engine on the runway. &quot;I want everyone off the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i> Bloggers are filth. They need to be destroyed. Blogging gives the
</I>&gt;<i> illusion of participation to a bunch of retards. . . . We need to put
</I>&gt;<i> these people in the oven!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I listened for a few more minutes as Weev held forth on the Federal
</I>&gt;<i> Reserve and about Jews. Unlike Fortuny, he made no attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> reconcile his trolling with conventional social norms. Two days later,
</I>&gt;<i> I flew to Los Angeles and met Weev at a train station in Fullerton, a
</I>&gt;<i> sleepy bungalow town folded into the vast Orange County grid. He is in
</I>&gt;<i> his early 20s with full lips, darting eyes and a nest of hair falling
</I>&gt;<i> back from his temples. He has a way of leaning in as he makes a point,
</I>&gt;<i> inviting you to share what might or might not be a joke.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we walked through Fullerton's downtown, Weev told me about his day
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; he'd lost $10,000 on the commodities market, he claimed &#8212; and
</I>&gt;<i> summarized his philosophy of &quot;global ruin.&quot; &quot;We are headed for a
</I>&gt;<i> Malthusian crisis,&quot; he said, with professorial confidence. &quot;Plankton
</I>&gt;<i> levels are dropping. Bees are dying. There are tortilla riots in
</I>&gt;<i> Mexico, the highest wheat prices in 30-odd years.&quot; He paused. &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> question we have to answer is: How do we kill four of the world's six
</I>&gt;<i> billion people in the most just way possible?&quot; He seemed excited to
</I>&gt;<i> have said this aloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideas like these bring trouble. Almost a year ago, while in the midst
</I>&gt;<i> of an LSD-and-methamphetamine bender, a longer-haired, wilder-eyed
</I>&gt;<i> Weev gave a talk called &quot;Internet Crime&quot; at a San Diego hacker
</I>&gt;<i> convention. He expounded on diverse topics like hacking the Firefox
</I>&gt;<i> browser, online trade in illegal weaponry and assassination markets &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> untraceable online betting pools that pay whoever predicts the exact
</I>&gt;<i> date of a political leader's demise. The talk led to two uncomfortable
</I>&gt;<i> interviews with federal agents and the decision to shed his legal
</I>&gt;<i> identity altogether. Weev now espouses &quot;the ruin lifestyle&quot; &#8212; moving
</I>&gt;<i> from condo to condo, living out of three bags, no name, no
</I>&gt;<i> possessions, all assets held offshore. As a member of a group of
</I>&gt;<i> hackers called &quot;the organization,&quot; which, he says, bring in upward of
</I>&gt;<i> $10 million annually, he says he can wreak ruin from anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We arrived at a strip mall. Out of the darkness, the coffinlike snout
</I>&gt;<i> of a new Rolls Royce Phantom materialized. A flying lady winked on the
</I>&gt;<i> hood. &quot;Your bag, sir?&quot; said the driver, a blond kid in a suit and tie.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is my car,&quot; Weev said. &quot;Get in.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And it was, for that night and the next, at least. The car's plush
</I>&gt;<i> chamber accentuated the boyishness of Weev, who wore sneakers and
</I>&gt;<i> jeans and hung from a leather strap like a subway rider. In the front
</I>&gt;<i> seat sat Claudia, a pretty college-age girl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I asked about the status of Weev's campaign against humanity. Things
</I>&gt;<i> seemed rather stable, I said, even with all this talk of trolling and
</I>&gt;<i> hacking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We're waiting,&quot; Weev said. &quot;We need someone to show us the way. The
</I>&gt;<i> messiah.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;How do you know it's not you?&quot; I asked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If it were me, I would know,&quot; he said. &quot;I would receive a sign.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zeno of Elea, Socrates and Jesus, Weev said, are his all-time favorite
</I>&gt;<i> trolls. He also identifies with Coyote and Loki, the trickster gods,
</I>&gt;<i> and especially with Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction. &quot;Loki was
</I>&gt;<i> a hacker. The other gods feared him, but they needed his tools.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I was just thinking of Kali!&quot; Claudia said with a giggle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over a candlelit dinner of tuna sashimi, Weev asked if I would
</I>&gt;<i> attribute his comments to Memphis Two, the handle he used to troll
</I>&gt;<i> Kathy Sierra, a blogger. Inspired by her touchy response to online
</I>&gt;<i> commenters, Weev said he &quot;dropped docs&quot; on Sierra, posting a
</I>&gt;<i> fabricated narrative of her career alongside her real Social Security
</I>&gt;<i> number and address. This was part of a larger trolling campaign
</I>&gt;<i> against Sierra, one that culminated in death threats. Weev says he has
</I>&gt;<i> access to hundreds of thousands of Social Security numbers. About a
</I>&gt;<i> month later, he sent me mine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Weev, Claudia and I hung out in Fullerton for two more nights, always
</I>&gt;<i> meeting and saying goodbye at the train station. I met their friend
</I>&gt;<i> Kate, who has been repeatedly banned from playing XBox Live for racist
</I>&gt;<i> slurs, which she also enjoys screaming at white pedestrians. Kate
</I>&gt;<i> checked my head for lice and kept calling me &quot;Jew.&quot; Relations have
</I>&gt;<i> since warmed. She now e-mails me puppy pictures and wants the names of
</I>&gt;<i> fun places for her coming visit to New York. On the last night, Weev
</I>&gt;<i> offered to take me to his apartment if I wore a blindfold and left my
</I>&gt;<i> cellphone behind. I was in, but Claudia vetoed the idea. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> was her apartment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does free speech tend to move toward the truth or away from it? When
</I>&gt;<i> does it evolve into a better collective understanding? When does it
</I>&gt;<i> collapse into the Babel of trolling, the pointless and eristic game of
</I>&gt;<i> talking the other guy into crying &quot;uncle&quot;? Is the effort to control
</I>&gt;<i> what's said always a form of censorship, or might certain rules be
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with our notions of free speech?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One promising answer comes from the computer scientist Jon Postel, now
</I>&gt;<i> known as &quot;god of the Internet&quot; for the influence he exercised over the
</I>&gt;<i> emerging network. In 1981, he formulated what's known as Postel's Law:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from
</I>&gt;<i> others.&quot; Originally intended to foster &quot;interoperability,&quot; the ability
</I>&gt;<i> of multiple computer systems to understand one another, Postel's Law
</I>&gt;<i> is now recognized as having wider applications. To build a robust
</I>&gt;<i> global network with no central authority, engineers were encouraged to
</I>&gt;<i> write code that could &quot;speak&quot; as clearly as possible yet &quot;listen&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> the widest possible range of other speakers, including those who do
</I>&gt;<i> not conform perfectly to the rules of the road. The human equivalent
</I>&gt;<i> of this robustness is a combination of eloquence and tolerance &#8212; the
</I>&gt;<i> spirit of good conversation. Trolls embody the opposite principle.
</I>&gt;<i> They are liberal in what they do and conservative in what they
</I>&gt;<i> construe as acceptable behavior from others. You, the troll says, are
</I>&gt;<i> not worthy of my understanding; I, therefore, will do everything I can
</I>&gt;<i> to confound you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why inflict anguish on a helpless stranger? It's tempting to blame
</I>&gt;<i> technology, which increases the range of our communications while
</I>&gt;<i> dehumanizing the recipients. Cases like An Hero and Megan Meier
</I>&gt;<i> presumably wouldn't happen if the perpetrators had to deliver their
</I>&gt;<i> messages in person. But while technology reduces the social barriers
</I>&gt;<i> that keep us from bedeviling strangers, it does not explain the
</I>&gt;<i> initial trolling impulse. This seems to spring from something ugly &#8212; a
</I>&gt;<i> destructive human urge that many feel but few act upon, the ambient
</I>&gt;<i> misanthropy that's a frequent ingredient of art, politics and, most of
</I>&gt;<i> all, jokes. There's a lot of hate out there, and a lot to hate as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far, despite all this discord, the Internet's system of civil
</I>&gt;<i> machines has proved more resilient than anyone imagined. As early as
</I>&gt;<i> 1994, the head of the Internet Society warned that spam &quot;will destroy
</I>&gt;<i> the network.&quot; The news media continually present the online world as a
</I>&gt;<i> Wild West infested with villainous hackers, spammers and pedophiles.
</I>&gt;<i> And yet the Internet is doing very well for a frontier town on the
</I>&gt;<i> brink of anarchy. Its traffic is expected to quadruple by 2012. To say
</I>&gt;<i> that trolls pose a threat to the Internet at this point is like saying
</I>&gt;<i> that crows pose a threat to farming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That the Internet is now capacious enough to host an entire subculture
</I>&gt;<i> of users who enjoy undermining its founding values is yet another
</I>&gt;<i> symptom of its phenomenal success. It may not be a bad thing that the
</I>&gt;<i> least-mature users have built remote ghettos of anonymity where the
</I>&gt;<i> malice is usually intramural. But how do we deal with cases like An
</I>&gt;<i> Hero, epilepsy hacks and the possibility of real harm being inflicted
</I>&gt;<i> on strangers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Several state legislators have recently proposed cyberbullying
</I>&gt;<i> measures. At the federal level, Representative Linda S&#225;nchez, a
</I>&gt;<i> Democrat from California, has introduced the Megan Meier Cyberbullying
</I>&gt;<i> Prevention Act, which would make it a federal crime to send any
</I>&gt;<i> communications with intent to cause &quot;substantial emotional distress.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In June, Lori Drew pleaded not guilty to charges that she violated
</I>&gt;<i> federal fraud laws by creating a false identity &quot;to torment, harass,
</I>&gt;<i> humiliate and embarrass&quot; another user, and by violating MySpace's
</I>&gt;<i> terms of service. But hardly anyone bothers to read terms of service,
</I>&gt;<i> and millions create false identities. &quot;While Drew's conduct is
</I>&gt;<i> immoral, it is a very big stretch to call it illegal,&quot; wrote the
</I>&gt;<i> online-privacy expert Prof. Daniel J. Solove on the blog Concurring
</I>&gt;<i> Opinions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many trolling practices, like prank-calling the Hendersons and
</I>&gt;<i> intimidating Kathy Sierra, violate existing laws against harassment
</I>&gt;<i> and threats. The difficulty is tracking down the perpetrators. In
</I>&gt;<i> order to prosecute, investigators must subpoena sites and Internet
</I>&gt;<i> service providers to learn the original author's IP address, and from
</I>&gt;<i> there, his legal identity. Local police departments generally don't
</I>&gt;<i> have the means to follow this digital trail, and federal investigators
</I>&gt;<i> have their hands full with spam, terrorism, fraud and child
</I>&gt;<i> pornography. But even if we had the resources to aggressively
</I>&gt;<i> prosecute trolls, would we want to? Are we ready for an Internet where
</I>&gt;<i> law enforcement keeps watch over every vituperative blog and
</I>&gt;<i> backbiting comments section, ready to spring at the first hint of
</I>&gt;<i> violence? Probably not. All vigorous debates shade into trolling at
</I>&gt;<i> the perimeter; it is next to impossible to excise the trolling without
</I>&gt;<i> snuffing out the debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we can't prosecute the trolling out of online anonymity, might
</I>&gt;<i> there be some way to mitigate it with technology? One solution that
</I>&gt;<i> has proved effective is &quot;disemvoweling&quot; &#8212; having message-board
</I>&gt;<i> administrators remove the vowels from trollish comments, which gives
</I>&gt;<i> trolls the visibility they crave while muddying their message. A
</I>&gt;<i> broader answer is persistent pseudonymity, a system of nicknames that
</I>&gt;<i> stay the same across multiple sites. This could reduce anonymity's
</I>&gt;<i> excesses while preserving its benefits for whistle-blowers and
</I>&gt;<i> overseas dissenters. Ultimately, as Fortuny suggests, trolling will
</I>&gt;<i> stop only when its audience stops taking trolls seriously. &quot;People
</I>&gt;<i> know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a
</I>&gt;<i> supermarket tabloid,&quot; says Dan Gillmor, who directs the Center for
</I>&gt;<i> Citizen Media. &quot;It should be even more so with anonymous comments.
</I>&gt;<i> They shouldn't start off with a credibility rating of, say, 0. It
</I>&gt;<i> should be more like negative-30.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, none of these methods will be fail-safe as long as
</I>&gt;<i> individuals like Fortuny construe human welfare the way they do. As we
</I>&gt;<i> discussed the epilepsy hack, I asked Fortuny whether a person is
</I>&gt;<i> obliged to give food to a starving stranger. No, Fortuny argued; no
</I>&gt;<i> one is entitled to our sympathy or empathy. We can choose to give or
</I>&gt;<i> withhold them as we see fit. &quot;I can't push you into the fire,&quot; he
</I>&gt;<i> explained, &quot;but I can look at you while you're burning in the fire and
</I>&gt;<i> not be required to help.&quot; Weeks later, after talking to his friend
</I>&gt;<i> Zach, Fortuny began considering the deeper emotional forces that drove
</I>&gt;<i> him to troll. The theory of the green hair, he said, &quot;allows me to
</I>&gt;<i> find people who do stupid things and turn them around. Zach asked if I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I could turn my parents around. I almost broke down. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that I could
</I>&gt;<i> actually be proud of . . . it was overwhelming.&quot; He continued: &quot;It's
</I>&gt;<i> not that I do this because I hate them. I do this because I'm trying
</I>&gt;<i> to save them.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Weeks before my visit with Fortuny, I had lunch with &quot;moot,&quot; the young
</I>&gt;<i> man who founded 4chan. After running the site under his pseudonym for
</I>&gt;<i> five years, he recently revealed his legal name to be Christopher
</I>&gt;<i> Poole. At lunch, Poole was quick to distance himself from the excesses
</I>&gt;<i> of /b/. &quot;Ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own
</I>&gt;<i> standards,&quot; he said. &quot;All we do is provide a general framework.&quot; He
</I>&gt;<i> was optimistic about Robot9000, a new 4chan board with a combination
</I>&gt;<i> of human and machine moderation. Users who make &quot;unoriginal&quot; or &quot;low
</I>&gt;<i> content&quot; posts are banned from Robot9000 for periods that lengthen
</I>&gt;<i> with each offense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The posts on Robot9000 one morning were indeed far more substantive
</I>&gt;<i> than /b/. With the cyborg moderation system silencing the trolls,
</I>&gt;<i> 4chan had begun to display signs of linearity, coherence, a sense of
</I>&gt;<i> collective enterprise. It was, in other words, robust. The anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> hordes swapped lists of albums and novels; some had pretty good taste.
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody tried to start a chess game: &quot;I'll start, e2 to e4,&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> quickly devolved into riffage with moves like &quot;Return to Sender,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;From Here to Infinity,&quot; &quot;Death to America&quot; and a predictably indecent
</I>&gt;<i> checkmate maneuver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shortly after 8 a.m., someone asked this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What makes a bad person? Or a good person? How do you know if you're
</I>&gt;<i> a bad person?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which prompted this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A good person is someone who follows the rules. A bad person is
</I>&gt;<i> someone who doesn't.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;you're breaking my rules, you bad person&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were echoes of antiquity:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;good: pleasure; bad: pain&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There is no morality. Only the right of the superior to rule over the
</I>&gt;<i> inferior.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And flirtations with postmodernity:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;good and bad are subjective&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we're going to turn into wormchow before the rest of the universe
</I>&gt;<i> even notices.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Books were prescribed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;read Kant, JS Mill, Bentham, Singer, etc. Noobs.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then finally this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I'd say empathy is probably a factor.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
