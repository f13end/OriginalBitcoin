</I>&gt;<i>  Dear subscribers P2P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With reference to this recent article, I take pleasure informing you as
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://c4ss.org/content/2165">http://c4ss.org/content/2165</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Libertarians throw the phrase &#8220;free market&#8221; around a lot, but the important
</I>&gt;<i> word among those two is *free*.  Markets, per se, are really an
</I>&gt;<i> after-thought. It&#8217;s not as if we don&#8217;t want freedom in our non-market
</I>&gt;<i> activities.  We want to have freedom, in all ways, including in our &#8220;market
</I>&gt;<i> transactions&#8221;.  The word market confuses a lot of people because they
</I>&gt;<i> imagine &#8220;markets&#8221; to be an institution, a thing that one can point to and
</I>&gt;<i> say &#8220;this is a Market&#8221;.  But we don&#8217;t mean it that way, really.  There&#8217;s no
</I>&gt;<i> such *thing* as a market.  It&#8217;s just a catch-all term to cover the sum
</I>&gt;<i> total of all exchanges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only alternative to a market is to have rationing by command.  One
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly with control of all goods who hands them out to people according to
</I>&gt;<i> a scheme that monopoly has planned out in advance.  A situation where there
</I>&gt;<i> is any sort of trade at all, is technically a market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is true that any exchange leaves people better off than they would
</I>&gt;<i> be had they not made the exchange, or they wouldn&#8217;t do it.  This even
</I>&gt;<i> applies to a simple robbery.  When the robber says &#8220;your money or your life&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> and you hand over the money, at the time, you felt that that was the better
</I>&gt;<i> option.  *However*, this is where context comes in.  To paraphrase
</I>&gt;<i> Lysander Spooner, one must question how the robber came into the position to
</I>&gt;<i> offer you that exchange.  For another oft used example, when the sweatshop
</I>&gt;<i> owner offers people a job under terrible conditions, and they take that job,
</I>&gt;<i> certainly, to them, it was better than not having that job.  Simply banning
</I>&gt;<i> that transaction will leave those people with even worse options to
</I>&gt;<i> survive.  But again, what must be questioned is how the sweatshop owner came
</I>&gt;<i> into the position of making that offer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the politicians and media pundits talk about &#8220;market-based solutions&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> or &#8220;markets&#8221; at all, one must wonder what sort of markets we are dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with.  Almost certainly not &#8220;free markets&#8221; for many, many reasons.  The
</I>&gt;<i> biggest culprit here, and the one that is the least visible to most people
</I>&gt;<i> is the banking system, with central banking as it&#8217;s lynchpin, the piece of
</I>&gt;<i> the machine that holds the whole thing together.  Even people that complain
</I>&gt;<i> about &#8220;the Fed&#8221; generally see the problem with it being &#8220;inflation&#8221;, meaning
</I>&gt;<i> price inflation.  The part that is less seen is how the banking system as we
</I>&gt;<i> know it creates oligopoly/oligopsony, meaning a market with a few large
</I>&gt;<i> producers who are able to wield unnatural control over buying labor and
</I>&gt;<i> selling their products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A fiat currency, that is to say a currency not backed by anything in
</I>&gt;<i> particular except the government forcing people to use it, floats against
</I>&gt;<i> the value of all goods and services that can be bought with that currency.
</I>&gt;<i> As more currency enters the system, the marginal value of each unit of
</I>&gt;<i> currency goes down.  This is ordinarily seen in the form of price inflation,
</I>&gt;<i> but that depends on how quickly goods and services are being produced in
</I>&gt;<i> relation to how quickly currency is entering the system.  Either way though,
</I>&gt;<i> X amount of currency will buy less if there is 10000*X amount of currency
</I>&gt;<i> than if there was 1000*X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now when a bank lends currency to a large corporation, to a great extent
</I>&gt;<i> (95-99%), that currency is &#8220;produced&#8221; out of thin air.  A number goes into a
</I>&gt;<i> ledger, and now *poof* that account has, say, 100 million dollars in it.
</I>&gt;<i> This currency doesn&#8217;t really exist in the system until it is spent.
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever that corporation spends that money on, it has essentially stolen
</I>&gt;<i> from everyone else who is holding an amount of that currency.  Assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> loan is going to be paid back, then it is the bank who has stolen it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (If I rob your house and lend the money I steal to someone to buy a lamp,
</I>&gt;<i> who does the lamp actually belong to?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whoever sold the corporation whatever it bought benefits a certain amount
</I>&gt;<i> from that new money as well.  They are getting a signal that there is more
</I>&gt;<i> demand for X, and will raise their prices.  They in turn will spend that
</I>&gt;<i> money, etc&#8230; Whoever sees that money last, will benefit least because prices
</I>&gt;<i> have already gone up to match the new level of currency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To simplify this model, you can see it as a redistribution of purchasing
</I>&gt;<i> power.  Those who borrow the most gain the most, and those who save, lose
</I>&gt;<i> the most.  In the end the banks themselves gain the most because they get
</I>&gt;<i> all of that purchasing power back and then some, *as long as interest
</I>&gt;<i> payments are able to keep up with inflation*.  This forces the banks to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that interest rates are high enough to account for inflation, or
</I>&gt;<i> they will lose purchasing power in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this leads to a situation where those who establish themselves early in
</I>&gt;<i> a market are able to compete for banking dollars better than late comers.
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, the money they got was more valuable than the money the late comers
</I>&gt;<i> got.  This leads to an ever escalating &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; as the fixed costs
</I>&gt;<i> of doing business rise and rise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This alone eventually creates oligopoly, with no other intervention.  To
</I>&gt;<i> make it worse, almost everything that the government does either destroys
</I>&gt;<i> capital outright, inhibits new capital formation, or controls how capital
</I>&gt;<i> can be transferred.  This makes the marginal cost of capital higher, which
</I>&gt;<i> benefits the existing owners of capital at the expense of everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> This artificial scarcity of capital creates an artificial abundance of labor
</I>&gt;<i> relative to capital, which leads to unemployment and low wages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regulation is a big part of this scheme.  The regulatory state as we know
</I>&gt;<i> it was created by the progressive movement in the late 1800s and early
</I>&gt;<i> 1900s.  Though the mythology of American history implies otherwise, it was
</I>&gt;<i> well known at the time that this would create oligopoly.  Oligopoly was
</I>&gt;<i> promoted as a more &#8220;rational&#8221; way of having markets than the &#8220;chaos&#8221; of free
</I>&gt;<i> markets.  Of course once you establish oligopoly, regulation becomes
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;necessary&#8221; in order to prevent the oligopoly from completely screwing
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else over.  It&#8217;s a chicken-egg type of self-fulfilling prophecy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it came to pass that the only beverage suppliers, including water, were
</I>&gt;<i> CocaCola Inc and PepsiCo, and it was impossibly expensive for anyone else to
</I>&gt;<i> *legally* provide beverages, there would be a good case to be made to
</I>&gt;<i> regulate those companies in order to prevent them from selling us sewage at
</I>&gt;<i> 10 dollars a bottle.  There would certainly be a black market in water,
</I>&gt;<i> which the &#8220;law and order&#8221; types would cry about.  The quality and price of
</I>&gt;<i> that black market water would be questionable and people would be killing
</I>&gt;<i> each other over turf.  There would probably be some right wingers at that
</I>&gt;<i> point saying &#8220;let them die of thirst&#8221; but in this case, the left-wingers
</I>&gt;<i> would be right, *in context*.  But one must again question how such a
</I>&gt;<i> situation came to pass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the major forms of oligopolistic regulation and one of the most
</I>&gt;<i> obvious is the idea of &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;.  Copyrights and patents
</I>&gt;<i> directly establish oligopoly, if not monopoly, for a certain amount of
</I>&gt;<i> time.  Patents at least are fairly limited in their time and scope.  But
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights are essentially perpetual for the purposes of any human
</I>&gt;<i> lifetime.  And the precedent has been set of extending copyright terms
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely, specifically to protect copyrights already held by big
</I>&gt;<i> business. (see Disney for an example)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the fact of establishing this system of oligopoly, the government
</I>&gt;<i> then will step in and subsidize those at the bottom of this
</I>&gt;<i> government-created pyramid in order to prevent mass starvation and riots.
</I>&gt;<i> Interestingly enough, this subsidy also creates a barrier to entry in
</I>&gt;<i> markets, by putting a floor on labor costs, making oligopoly worse, and
</I>&gt;<i> pushing more people down to this floor in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually the logic of this system leads to a sort of Kapitalist Leninism,
</I>&gt;<i> in which there is one large producer that sells everything and employs
</I>&gt;<i> everyone who is employed and everyone else is on welfare.  The movie Wall-e
</I>&gt;<i> showed this sort of &#8220;business communism&#8221; pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right wingers talk about &#8220;markets&#8221; all day long, but to a large extent,
</I>&gt;<i> what they oppose is merely the welfare part of the system.  They oppose the
</I>&gt;<i> redistribution from the rich and middle class to the poor, but not the
</I>&gt;<i> redistribution from the poor and middle class to the rich.  If one takes
</I>&gt;<i> their ideology to its logical extreme, we would have the banks owning
</I>&gt;<i> everything, maybe the top 10% of all workers in each field would have a job
</I>&gt;<i> and everyone else would be forced to join the military or starve.  This
</I>&gt;<i> military would necessarily be employed to protect &#8220;private property&#8221; from
</I>&gt;<i> looters and rioters, so the common man would be forced to kill his neighbors
</I>&gt;<i> or be killed by them.  The Kapitalist Leninism of the liberal consensus
</I>&gt;<i> almost looks good in comparison.  This is what so-called liberals or
</I>&gt;<i> progressives envision when you say the term &#8220;free markets&#8221; or &#8220;capitalism&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> to them.  Neither the &#8220;left&#8221; nor the &#8220;right&#8221; as we know them today
</I>&gt;<i> understands or opposes the mechanism of oligopoly, they&#8217;re just fighting
</I>&gt;<i> over how the spoils are spread around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To our descendents who will live in a free society, &#8220;Dilbert&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t make
</I>&gt;<i> any sense.  No one could stay in business doing those things, because
</I>&gt;<i> someone else would rise up to challenge any business run so poorly.  &#8220;Office
</I>&gt;<i> politics&#8221; would be impossible because you&#8217;d lose money, and there wouldn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> be endless reams of financing and &#8220;bailouts&#8221; to keep you in business.
</I>&gt;<i> Capital would grow horizontally and organically, because there would be an
</I>&gt;<i> incentive to save.  This would lower the price of capital and make
</I>&gt;<i> businesses more and more competitive, in wages, prices and product quality.
</I>&gt;<i> Without banks redistributing capital to the core and without the government
</I>&gt;<i> raising the barriers to entry, &#8220;big business&#8221; as we know it &#8211; oligopolies
</I>&gt;<i> who decide who is employed and who is unemployed, who produce shoddy
</I>&gt;<i> products with poor customer service because &#8220;where else are you going to
</I>&gt;<i> go?&#8221; would be impossible.  This is why the &#8220;free&#8221; part of the phrase free
</I>&gt;<i> markets is much more important than the market part.  We already have
</I>&gt;<i> markets.  What we don&#8217;t have is freedom.
