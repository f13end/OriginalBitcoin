<PRE>the term free market is of course problematic, since all market forms are
necessarily embedded in an institutional framework and social constraints;
they of course mostly deplore state and corporate monopolistic constraints,
and not true costing and the full incorporation of externalities,

your last sentence suggest that the commons is a full set of solutions, I'd
like to know more about that,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.They say: &#8222;The only alternative to a market is to have rationing by
</I>&gt;<i> command.&#8220; It is exactly this argument that kills any discussion by
</I>&gt;<i> reducing it to this either-or-position. There are a lot of possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> in between, one of them, also I wouldn't favour it so much, is the
</I>&gt;<i> Keynesian Welfare State. And another one, I favour much more, is
</I>&gt;<i> commoning, the democratic, need-oriented control of production by all
</I>&gt;<i> people concerned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.They complain about the banks' &#8222;unnatural control over buying labor and
</I>&gt;<i> selling their products.&#8220; But they do not question, whether buying labour
</I>&gt;<i> and selling products, i.e. commodities, is the best way to organise the
</I>&gt;<i> production and reproduction of our lives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.Markets, even if they are &#8222;free&#8220;, allocate commodities according to how
</I>&gt;<i> much money one has and not according to needs. Even, if they suppose, that
</I>&gt;<i> money would be distributed more equal in their system, this is
</I>&gt;<i> questionable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.The focus on the market still reduces people to consumers, and social
</I>&gt;<i> relations to economic relations, instead of stressing the importance of
</I>&gt;<i> co-operative production and democratic regulation as commons do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.And at last, the notion of &#8222;free marktes&#8220; as far as I know, should
</I>&gt;<i> support circulation and thus stimulate consumption and possibly is useful
</I>&gt;<i> for situations of deficiency. But in our situation, where it is about
</I>&gt;<i> reducing consumption of ressources I don't think that free markets are a
</I>&gt;<i> solution. It is the big value of a commons' perspective that it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to combine social justice with sustainable ressource use.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Dear subscribers P2P
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With reference to this recent article, I take pleasure informing you as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://c4ss.org/content/2165">http://c4ss.org/content/2165</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Libertarians throw the phrase &#8220;free market&#8221; around a lot, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; word among those two is *free*.  Markets, per se, are really an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after-thought. It&#8217;s not as if we don&#8217;t want freedom in our non-market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; activities.  We want to have freedom, in all ways, including in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#8220;market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transactions&#8221;.  The word market confuses a lot of people because they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imagine &#8220;markets&#8221; to be an institution, a thing that one can point to and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say &#8220;this is a Market&#8221;.  But we don&#8217;t mean it that way, really.  There&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such *thing* as a market.  It&#8217;s just a catch-all term to cover the sum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; total
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of all exchanges.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only alternative to a market is to have rationing by command.  One
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monopoly with control of all goods who hands them out to people according
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a scheme that monopoly has planned out in advance.  A situation where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is any sort of trade at all, is technically a market.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now it is true that any exchange leaves people better off than they would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had they not made the exchange, or they wouldn&#8217;t do it.  This even
</I>&gt;<i> applies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a simple robbery.  When the robber says &#8220;your money or your life&#8221; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand over the money, at the time, you felt that that was the better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  *However*, this is where context comes in.  To paraphrase Lysander
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Spooner,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one must question how the robber came into the position to offer you that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange.  For another oft used example, when the sweatshop owner offers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people a job under terrible conditions, and they take that job,
</I>&gt;<i> certainly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to them, it was better than not having that job.  Simply banning that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction will leave those people with even worse options to survive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again, what must be questioned is how the sweatshop owner came into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; position of making that offer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When the politicians and media pundits talk about &#8220;market-based
</I>&gt;<i> solutions&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or &#8220;markets&#8221; at all, one must wonder what sort of markets we are dealing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with.  Almost certainly not &#8220;free markets&#8221; for many, many reasons.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; biggest culprit here, and the one that is the least visible to most
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the banking system, with central banking as it&#8217;s lynchpin, the piece
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the machine that holds the whole thing together.  Even people that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about &#8220;the Fed&#8221; generally see the problem with it being &#8220;inflation&#8221;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; price inflation.  The part that is less seen is how the banking system as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know it creates oligopoly/oligopsony, meaning a market with a few large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; producers who are able to wield unnatural control over buying labor and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selling their products.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A fiat currency, that is to say a currency not backed by anything in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular except the government forcing people to use it, floats against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the value of all goods and services that can be bought with that
</I>&gt;<i> currency.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As more currency enters the system, the marginal value of each unit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currency goes down.  This is ordinarily seen in the form of price
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inflation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that depends on how quickly goods and services are being produced in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relation to how quickly currency is entering the system.  Either way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X amount of currency will buy less if there is 10000*X amount of currency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than if there was 1000*X.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now when a bank lends currency to a large corporation, to a great extent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (95-99%), that currency is &#8220;produced&#8221; out of thin air.  A number goes
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ledger, and now *poof* that account has, say, 100 million dollars in it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This currency doesn&#8217;t really exist in the system until it is spent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whatever that corporation spends that money on, it has essentially stolen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from everyone else who is holding an amount of that currency.  Assuming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loan is going to be paid back, then it is the bank who has stolen it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (If I rob your house and lend the money I steal to someone to buy a lamp,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who does the lamp actually belong to?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whoever sold the corporation whatever it bought benefits a certain amount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from that new money as well.  They are getting a signal that there is
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demand for X, and will raise their prices.  They in turn will spend that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money, etc&#8230; Whoever sees that money last, will benefit least because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have already gone up to match the new level of currency.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To simplify this model, you can see it as a redistribution of purchasing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; power.  Those who borrow the most gain the most, and those who save, lose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the most.  In the end the banks themselves gain the most because they get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of that purchasing power back and then some, *as long as interest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payments are able to keep up with inflation*.  This forces the banks to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure that interest rates are high enough to account for inflation, or
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will lose purchasing power in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But this leads to a situation where those who establish themselves early
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a market are able to compete for banking dollars better than late comers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Plus, the money they got was more valuable than the money the late comers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; got.  This leads to an ever escalating &#8220;barrier to entry&#8221; as the fixed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; costs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of doing business rise and rise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This alone eventually creates oligopoly, with no other intervention.  To
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make it worse, almost everything that the government does either destroys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capital outright, inhibits new capital formation, or controls how capital
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be transferred.  This makes the marginal cost of capital higher,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefits the existing owners of capital at the expense of everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This artificial scarcity of capital creates an artificial abundance of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; labor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relative to capital, which leads to unemployment and low wages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regulation is a big part of this scheme.  The regulatory state as we know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was created by the progressive movement in the late 1800s and early
</I>&gt;<i> 1900s.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Though the mythology of American history implies otherwise, it was well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; known at the time that this would create oligopoly.  Oligopoly was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; promoted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a more &#8220;rational&#8221; way of having markets than the &#8220;chaos&#8221; of free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; markets.  Of course once you establish oligopoly, regulation becomes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#8220;necessary&#8221; in order to prevent the oligopoly from completely screwing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else over.  It&#8217;s a chicken-egg type of self-fulfilling prophecy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it came to pass that the only beverage suppliers, including water,
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CocaCola Inc and PepsiCo, and it was impossibly expensive for anyone else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *legally* provide beverages, there would be a good case to be made to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regulate those companies in order to prevent them from selling us sewage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10 dollars a bottle.  There would certainly be a black market in water,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which the &#8220;law and order&#8221; types would cry about.  The quality and price
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that black market water would be questionable and people would be killing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each other over turf.  There would probably be some right wingers at that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point saying &#8220;let them die of thirst&#8221; but in this case, the left-wingers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be right, *in context*.  But one must again question how such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation came to pass.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the major forms of oligopolistic regulation and one of the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obvious is the idea of &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;.  Copyrights and patents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly establish oligopoly, if not monopoly, for a certain amount of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time.  Patents at least are fairly limited in their time and scope.  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copyrights are essentially perpetual for the purposes of any human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lifetime.  And the precedent has been set of extending copyright terms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indefinitely, specifically to protect copyrights already held by big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; business. (see Disney for an example)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After the fact of establishing this system of oligopoly, the government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will step in and subsidize those at the bottom of this government-created
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pyramid in order to prevent mass starvation and riots.  Interestingly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough, this subsidy also creates a barrier to entry in markets, by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; putting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a floor on labor costs, making oligopoly worse, and pushing more people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to this floor in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually the logic of this system leads to a sort of Kapitalist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Leninism,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in which there is one large producer that sells everything and employs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone who is employed and everyone else is on welfare.  The movie
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wall-e
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; showed this sort of &#8220;business communism&#8221; pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right wingers talk about &#8220;markets&#8221; all day long, but to a large extent,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they oppose is merely the welfare part of the system.  They oppose the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redistribution from the rich and middle class to the poor, but not the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redistribution from the poor and middle class to the rich.  If one takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their ideology to its logical extreme, we would have the banks owning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everything, maybe the top 10% of all workers in each field would have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; job
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and everyone else would be forced to join the military or starve.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; military would necessarily be employed to protect &#8220;private property&#8221; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looters and rioters, so the common man would be forced to kill his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; neighbors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or be killed by them.  The Kapitalist Leninism of the liberal consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; almost looks good in comparison.  This is what so-called liberals or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; progressives envision when you say the term &#8220;free markets&#8221; or
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;capitalism&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to them.  Neither the &#8220;left&#8221; nor the &#8220;right&#8221; as we know them today
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understands or opposes the mechanism of oligopoly, they&#8217;re just fighting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over how the spoils are spread around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To our descendents who will live in a free society, &#8220;Dilbert&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any sense.  No one could stay in business doing those things, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone else would rise up to challenge any business run so poorly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#8220;Office
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; politics&#8221; would be impossible because you&#8217;d lose money, and there
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be endless reams of financing and &#8220;bailouts&#8221; to keep you in business.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Capital would grow horizontally and organically, because there would be
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incentive to save.  This would lower the price of capital and make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; businesses more and more competitive, in wages, prices and product
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without banks redistributing capital to the core and without the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; raising the barriers to entry, &#8220;big business&#8221; as we know it &#8211; oligopolies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who decide who is employed and who is unemployed, who produce shoddy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; products with poor customer service because &#8220;where else are you going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go?&#8221; would be impossible.  This is why the &#8220;free&#8221; part of the phrase free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; markets is much more important than the market part.  We already have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; markets.  What we don&#8217;t have is freedom.
