In any case, such a new technology could only save capitalism if it
were possible to capitalize the increased productivity as a source of
rents.  The whole idea of cognitive capitalism was to capitalize
&quot;intellect&quot; as a source of rent, but that's hit the wall of the
growing unenforceability of &quot;intellectual property.&quot;

Never mind Linux; Windows' real competitor is web-based and
browser-based software.  And although Google has been able to
capitalize on that as a source of revenue stream, it will probably be
far smaller than the revenue stream it's destroying.  Traditional
encyclopedias had their revenues decimated by Encarta, which in turn
was destroyed by Wikipedia.  File-sharing is seriously hurting
recording industry profit margins, and ditto aggregators the dead tree
newspapers.

It's plausible that the much smaller pie might still be sufficient to
support actual reporters, recording artists, etc., if it were all
equitably distributed among the producers and none of it went to the
record companies or media conglomerates.  But that's not exactly
capitalism, is it?

I think the most exciting forms of new physical production, like
micromanufacturing, will have a similar effect on revenue streams.
Patents are a lot more costly and unprofitable to enforce, the smaller
the batch size and market become.
