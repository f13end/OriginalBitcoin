<PRE>Dear Nikos,

just in case this could inspire you to a reply, Andy makes the argument that
conservatism cannot really become p2p,

Michel

On Sat, Mar 20, 2010 at 9:25 PM, Andy Robinson &lt;<A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">ldxar1 at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Another thought...  On the question of whether there is such a thing as
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer conservatism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason Blond cannot be peer-to-peer is his complicity with
</I>&gt;<i> neototalitarianism (outlined previously).  While his aspirations aim towards
</I>&gt;<i> a type of 'community' which has some horizontal aspects (as would also be
</I>&gt;<i> true of Stalin!), the means to this end are fundamentally hierarchical, and
</I>&gt;<i> rely on vertical forms of agency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, conservatism tends not to be very 'peer-to-peer' because it
</I>&gt;<i> relies on a prescriptive moral position connected to social
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarianism: people are expected to conform to traditional prohibitions
</I>&gt;<i> in fields such as sexual morality, to defer to 'superiors', to obey those in
</I>&gt;<i> authority and so on.  However, it has also never been as single-mindedly
</I>&gt;<i> vertical as some varieties of authoritarian socialism.  Conservatives such
</I>&gt;<i> as Burke and Oakeshott tend to emphasise society against the state, and want
</I>&gt;<i> power to be located primarily in social networks which are viewed either as
</I>&gt;<i> more natural or moral than the state (expressing God's will, organic
</I>&gt;<i> society, etc), or as more beneficial (social forms which persist in time are
</I>&gt;<i> treated as more trustworthy responses to social problems than state 'social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering' from first principles).  A consistent conservative, therefore,
</I>&gt;<i> should not support totalitarian or intrusive states (though in practice
</I>&gt;<i> conservatives very often weigh the benefits of authoritarianism for social
</I>&gt;<i> morality as outweighing its costs for social composition - particularly if
</I>&gt;<i> they take the situation to be one of social breakdown).  Tradition,
</I>&gt;<i> including customary entitlements, is thus the conservative answer to the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of how to limit the state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also would not tend to support peer-to-peer, horizontal, autonomous,
</I>&gt;<i> voluntary kinds of society for two reasons: firstly, conservatives tend to
</I>&gt;<i> privilege time-honoured forms of social life over newly invented ones, and
</I>&gt;<i> are suspicious of relations which fail to preserve tradition; secondly,
</I>&gt;<i> conservatives usually favour societies which, while possibly informal and
</I>&gt;<i> not state-dominated, are also deeply hierarchical.  Conservatism in its
</I>&gt;<i> traditional form is connected to 'concentrated informal sanctions' (the
</I>&gt;<i> power of social elites), against both the 'concentrated (or diffuse) formal
</I>&gt;<i> sanctions' of various state regimes and the 'diffuse informal sanctions' of
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal forms of life.  This means that conservative networks tend to be
</I>&gt;<i> 'reactive' networks rather than affinity-networks; they have some node of
</I>&gt;<i> identity in them which acts as an ersatz verticality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, something like a 'peer-to-peer conservatism' can be observed
</I>&gt;<i> empirically in the practice of societies which are diffuse and acephalous in
</I>&gt;<i> social form (hence reliant on the network form), but doctrinally
</I>&gt;<i> conservative - the Pathan/Pashtun of Afghanistan/Pakistan being a
</I>&gt;<i> particularly apposite instance of this combination of attributes.  In
</I>&gt;<i> societies of this kind, tradition can be an iron law, but only to the extent
</I>&gt;<i> that it is upheld by communities in the present.  It is dependent on the
</I>&gt;<i> power of interpreters of tradition whose position is rather like that of
</I>&gt;<i> Clastrean chiefs; they are dependent on their 'soft' power over those who
</I>&gt;<i> accept their authority, for their 'hard' power to enforce conservative
</I>&gt;<i> standards against deviants.  In social terms, this leads to a degree of
</I>&gt;<i> looseness - taboo practices can persist in informally tolerated ways,
</I>&gt;<i> power-holders cannot accumulate unconditional power, often being turned in
</I>&gt;<i> practice into mediators as much as authorities, and 'traditions' can be
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten when there is widespread consensus for doing so - but its cruel
</I>&gt;<i> edge should not be minimised - societies of this kind can be viciously
</I>&gt;<i> repressive of certain kinds of difference (e.g. women who deviate from
</I>&gt;<i> patriarchal standards), prohibited in concentrated informal ways such as
</I>&gt;<i> decisions of traditional elders and village councils, but enforced in
</I>&gt;<i> diffuse, 'peer-to-peer' ways which actualise such centralised power (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> codes of honour enforced violently through kinship systems).  The Taleban,
</I>&gt;<i> incidentally, are an outgrowth of Pashtun society, but of its 'restive
</I>&gt;<i> youth' stratum particularly, and hence combine an appeal to social
</I>&gt;<i> conservatism with a sociological position rather distant from it - they
</I>&gt;<i> actually have a residue of 'modernity' about them in many regards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also seen arguments that groups such as the Ecuadorean indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> movement CONAIE should be viewed as 'militantly conservative', in that their
</I>&gt;<i> aim is to preserve traditional forms of society, even while it is subversive
</I>&gt;<i> of the dominant order within their nation-state.  I think this is slightly
</I>&gt;<i> inaccurate, because indigenous societies are typically too reliant on
</I>&gt;<i> diffuse informal (rather than concentrated) sanctions and too open to
</I>&gt;<i> interconnectedness with other forms of life to be considered truly
</I>&gt;<i> conservative.  It does, however, raise the question of the relationship
</I>&gt;<i> between conservatism and communitarianism, as the Ecuadorian movement in
</I>&gt;<i> particular is strongly communitarian.  The paradox is that it is
</I>&gt;<i> communitarian about communities which are not strongly repressive, so that
</I>&gt;<i> the content of its communitarianism is more formal than prescriptive (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> an emphasis on the importance of community, rather than the universal
</I>&gt;<i> validity or unquestionability of certain community preferences).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm inclined to view communitarianism as a conservative trope arising
</I>&gt;<i> within some movements which are not inherently conservative, and as a
</I>&gt;<i> defensive outcome of the colonial onslaught on forms of life.  In extreme
</I>&gt;<i> cases (Fiji comes to mind), the corrosion of indigenous lifeworlds does give
</I>&gt;<i> rise to forms of social conservatism which emerge out of the transmutation
</I>&gt;<i> of indigenous cosmologies.  This arises when immanence is replaced with
</I>&gt;<i> loss.  The nexus of conservatism typically focuses on a lost Golden Age and
</I>&gt;<i> the attempt to restore it by fetishistically performing its external/formal
</I>&gt;<i> attributes (clinging to tradition, rejecting 'modern' innovations, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> This nexus is rather different from that of indigenous cosmology, which is
</I>&gt;<i> lived as immediate intensity.  It is easy to see, however, how indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> cosmologies connected to lifeworlds which are lost and can no longer be
</I>&gt;<i> performed immanently, can transmute into conservatisms.  The transmutation
</I>&gt;<i> involved is that the immediacy of indigenous cosmology - which is quite
</I>&gt;<i> rightly remembered as intensity - is constructed as lost, and its recovery
</I>&gt;<i> connected to formal performativity of its external attributes (which, while
</I>&gt;<i> they may have been automatic in its immanent and ecological context, are
</I>&gt;<i> connected to lifestyle regulation and psychological repression when
</I>&gt;<i> performed outside this context).  Of course, such external performance
</I>&gt;<i> cannot actually reproduce the lost immediacy and immanence, since its
</I>&gt;<i> generative structure is transcendental, and repressive both socially and
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically.  Rather, its reconstruction requires the recovery of the
</I>&gt;<i> relationality of its context, either through a more thoroughgoing,
</I>&gt;<i> ecological restoration of its conditions of existence or through the
</I>&gt;<i> recreation of this immanent relationality in new contexts.  This is why the
</I>&gt;<i> other possible pole of indigenous reconstruction intersects with autonomous
</I>&gt;<i> social movements and with anarchism and autonomism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Golden Age myth is actually extremely widespread in ideologies of the
</I>&gt;<i> right, including conservatism, reaction/ultraconservatism, and fascism, and
</I>&gt;<i> its significance should be understood in terms of its relationship to the
</I>&gt;<i> transcendental function of the elevation of past over present and the
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically and socially repressive basis for its performance (in
</I>&gt;<i> Britain today, this would be the ideal of the 1950s; one can also compare
</I>&gt;<i> cases such as *hindutva*, *salafiya*, Nazism, Serbian ultranationalism,
</I>&gt;<i> etc).  It should *not* - as is commonly done by non-conservatives and
</I>&gt;<i> anti-totalitarians - be taken as evidence that seeking a better world is as
</I>&gt;<i> such unjustified and is a socially dangerous myth, and/or that progress is
</I>&gt;<i> always better than a romanticised past.  The Golden Age myth is often a way
</I>&gt;<i> of handling real experiences of loss and trauma, albeit in a distorting way,
</I>&gt;<i> and the affirmative energies underlying it need to be released into
</I>&gt;<i> affirmative forms of 'propulsive utopia' (see Bonanno), rather than simply
</I>&gt;<i> dismissed because they can sometimes be captured by reactive forces.  What
</I>&gt;<i> should, rather, be abandoned is the repressive modality of producing social
</I>&gt;<i> performativities which conservative and related ideologies *share* with
</I>&gt;<i> progressivist modernisms and anti-perfectionist centrisms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is connected to peer-to-peer and networks on a deeper level than the
</I>&gt;<i> sociological - the various reactive ideologies also depend on the denial of
</I>&gt;<i> horizontality at the level of flows within the self (insisting on the molar
</I>&gt;<i> self as referent, rather than molecularity of becomings), and working to
</I>&gt;<i> protect the molar self from decomposition by warding off flows which exceed
</I>&gt;<i> the self and carry it away from its imagined purity into the chaos of
</I>&gt;<i> unregulated networks (see Theweleit's excellent study of Freikorps
</I>&gt;<i> discourse).  Strong identities thus implicitly preclude transversal
</I>&gt;<i> connections by regimenting connections to the world in line with
</I>&gt;<i> transcendental/despotic signification and the maintenance of a hierarchy of
</I>&gt;<i> values (the self / pure / integrated / class / race / dominatory masculine
</I>&gt;<i> 'heroism' at the top, and difference / impurity / floods / the
</I>&gt;<i> undifferentiated mass / women at the bottom).  In concrete terms, this
</I>&gt;<i> limits reactive networks in their ability to form transversal connections
</I>&gt;<i> across certain kinds of difference.  A *hindutva* network for example may
</I>&gt;<i> be internally horizontal, and so might a *salafi* network, but a *hindutva
</I>&gt;<i> * activist and a *salafi* could never form horizontal connections to one
</I>&gt;<i> another, without shattering their respective identities.  In this sense, a
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy operates as the outer limit (even if only conceptual/imaginary) of
</I>&gt;<i> the network.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Michel Bauwens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20th March 2010
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  *David Brooks* explains&lt;<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/opinion/19brooks.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/opinion/19brooks.html</A>&gt;the ideas of the Conservative British writer Phillip Blond:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&#8220;Blond argues that over the past generation we have witnessed two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolutions, both of which liberated the individual and decimated local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associations. First, there was a revolution from the left: a cultural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolution that displaced traditional manners and mores; a legal revolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that emphasized individual rights instead of responsibilities; a welfare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolution in which social workers displaced mutual aid societies and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-organized associations.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Then there was the market revolution from the right. In the age of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deregulation, giant chains like Wal-Mart decimated local shop owners. Global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> financial markets took over small banks, so that the local knowledge of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> town banker was replaced by a manic herd of traders thousands of miles away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unions withered.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The two revolutions talked the language of individual freedom, but they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perversely ended up creating greater centralization. They created an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> atomized, segmented society and then the state had to come in and attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repair the damage.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The free-market revolution didn&#8217;t create the pluralistic decentralized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economy. It created a centralized financial monoculture, which requires a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gigantic government to audit its activities. The effort to liberate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals from repressive social constraints didn&#8217;t produce a flowering of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom; it weakened families, increased out-of-wedlock births and turned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbors into strangers. In Britain, you get a country with rising crime,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and, as a result, four million security cameras.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *In a much-discussed essay in Prospect magazine in February 2009, Blond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrote, &#8220;Look at the society we have become: We are a bi-polar nation, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bureaucratic, centralised state that presides dysfunctionally over an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasingly fragmented, disempowered and isolated citizenry.&#8221; In a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essay, he added, &#8220;The welfare state and the market state are now two defunct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mutually supporting failures.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The task today, he argued in a recent speech, is to revive the sector
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the two revolutions have mutually decimated: &#8220;The project of radical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transformative conservatism is nothing less than the restoration and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creation of human association, and the elevation of society and the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who form it to their proper central and sovereign station.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Economically, Blond lays out three big areas of reform: remoralize the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market, relocalize the economy and recapitalize the poor. This would mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passing zoning legislation to give small shopkeepers a shot against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retail giants, reducing barriers to entry for new businesses, revitalizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local banks, encouraging employee share ownership, setting up local capital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funds so community associations could invest in local enterprises, rewarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> savings, cutting regulations that socialize risk and privatize profit, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reducing the subsidies that flow from big government and big business.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *To create a civil state, Blond would reduce the power of senior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government officials and widen the discretion of front-line civil servants,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people actually working in neighborhoods. He would decentralize power,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> giving more budget authority to the smallest units of government. He would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funnel more services through charities. He would increase investments in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure, so that more places could be vibrant economic hubs. He would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rebuild the &#8220;village college&#8221; so that universities would be more intertwined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the towns around them.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Essentially, Blond would take a political culture that has been oriented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around individual choice and replace it with one oriented around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationships and associations. His ideas have made a big splash in Britain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the past year. His think tank, ResPublica, is influential with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conservative Party. His book, &#8220;Red Tory,&#8221; is coming out soon.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
