<PRE>This is total garbage. Anti-capitalism at the core of education? Capitalism
never recognized as the Great Engine of Great Societies? Grant must not have
been educated in the USA, nor tried to have a discussion about health care
with a Republican. Capitalism is a small-business owner with a few dry
cleaning places? True, but hardly telling the entire story. I'd like to
think more of how capitalism is the deforestation of sub-Saharan Africa for
4 July barbeques. That a lack of heroes is valorized here is a

Seriously, my experience could not be more different than this
bizarro-reality Grant is describing. And I should know, I've been a
&quot;Marxist&quot; since age 12 (1995). That's plenty of time to learn to hate the
extreme pro-capitalist bend of education and US society in general. The
media, the government, and all non-radical Leftists and Anarchists pretty
much get a warm fuzzy over capitalism and pull out anger if their
assumptions are questioned (Whither externalities, Mr. Smith?). If he is
talking about a different society, then perhaps his critique is somewhat
valid. Since he mentions New Hampshire, I'm not sure that is the case.

Also, the link to his blog doesn't work.

</I>&gt;<i> [image: becker]I am always a surprised that no one much bothers to tell
</I>&gt;<i> the story of capitalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the stories we prefer to tell our children is that capitalism is a
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous, soulless, relentlessly exploitative exercise. Indeed, this story
</I>&gt;<i> is so preferred as our received wisdom, that it is exceedingly rare to here
</I>&gt;<i> anyone recite Adam Smith&#8217;s magical insight, that good things can and do come
</I>&gt;<i> from people pursuing their own, sometimes narrow, objectives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The anti-capitalism view is an ideological fixture of our education systems
</I>&gt;<i> at every level, from grade to graduate school.  We could call it orthodoxy
</I>&gt;<i> if it were not so much like boilerplate.  It&#8217;s not so much argued as
</I>&gt;<i> assumed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalists are sanguine.  Apparently, they don&#8217;t feel they have to tell
</I>&gt;<i> the story of capitalism.  Somehow capitalism will teach its own lessons.
</I>&gt;<i>  Once people escape the magic kingdom of education, the truth will dawn.
</I>&gt;<i>  Once they have spend a little time in the marketplace, the penny will drop.
</I>&gt;<i>  Or, as the English like to say, &quot;if a man&#8217;s not a Marxist at 20, there&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> something wrong with his heart.  But if he is still a Marxist at 30, there&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> something wrong with his head.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When Peter Robinson interviewed Gary Becker, Professor at the University of
</I>&gt;<i> Chicago and winner of the Nobel Prize, recently, the master surprised
</I>&gt;<i> Robinson be announcing, &quot;Markets are hard to appreciate.&quot;   Robinson asks
</I>&gt;<i> for clarification and Becker obliges:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;People tend to impute good motives to government. And if you assume that
</I>&gt;<i> government officials are well meaning, then you also tend to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> government officials always act on behalf of the greater good. People
</I>&gt;<i> understand that entrepreneurs and investors by contrast just try to make
</I>&gt;<i> money, not act on behalf of the greater good. And they have trouble seeing
</I>&gt;<i> how this pursuit of profits can lift the general standard of living. The
</I>&gt;<i> idea is too counterintuitive. So we&#8217;re always up against a kind of in-built
</I>&gt;<i> suspicion of markets. There&#8217;s always a temptation to believe that markets
</I>&gt;<i> succeed by looting the unfortunate.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I think this gets at some part of the heart of the problem.  Capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> is, as Becker says, counterintuitive.  It tells a bad story.  In fact, it
</I>&gt;<i> isn&#8217;t a story.  It is anti-storyish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalism doesn&#8217;t have heroes.  It doesn&#8217;t have people called to higher
</I>&gt;<i> motives.  It doesn&#8217;t have noble sacrifices for the good of others.  It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn&#8217;t, usually, have daring action on a public stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, capitalism is just has some guy who owns a handful of dry cleaning
</I>&gt;<i> outfits in a small town in New Hampshire.  He works hard, supplies a
</I>&gt;<i> service, pays off his loans, coaches Little League, goes to church, gets his
</I>&gt;<i> kids through college, and spends his very few disposable hours on the golf
</I>&gt;<i> course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Script!  Casting!  Some one call the studio!   This is appalling.  It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn&#8217;t matter that out of these mundane activities in lots of towns big and
</I>&gt;<i> small, played out by millions of people across the US, something remarkable
</I>&gt;<i> will come.  This just isn&#8217;t a story anyone wants to listen to.  So no one
</I>&gt;<i> much wants to tell it.  Not Hollywood.  Not our mythmakers.  Not our story
</I>&gt;<i> tellers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The economist has spoken.  It is a little clearer why we do not tell the
</I>&gt;<i> story of capitalism.  It just doesn&#8217;t tell very well. But if the
</I>&gt;<i> anthropologist may join in here.  Can we at least acknowledge that there is
</I>&gt;<i> something fabulously odd about a culture that depends on capitalism but that
</I>&gt;<i> will not ever acknowledge it in the stories it tells itself about itself.
