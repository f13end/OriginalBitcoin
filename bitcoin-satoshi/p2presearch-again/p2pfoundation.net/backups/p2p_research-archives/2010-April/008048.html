*After the Health Care Legislation: the Challenges Facing Progressives in
the Age of Obama*

The passage of the healthcare bill was not an embodiment of the vision of
universal health care that many of us aspire to, but it was a major
turn-around in American politics, a moment in which Barack Obama was able to
regain some of the moral authority that inspired his landslide election only
a year and a half ago and gave many of us reason to hope a space was opening
up for the creation of a more progressive, more social connected, more
loving and caring society.


But Obama will not succeed in fending off the Sarah Palin led Tea Party
revolt against this progressive vision without the decisive emergence of a
different kind of progressive voice into public space, a voice on the
spiritual left of Obama that strengthens his own resolve, shows him how a
new spiritual progressive vision can be both morally compelling and
realistic in political terms.


Yet this is very complicated, because Obama's programs actually erode the
support for progressive politics. Most people think Obama IS the Left, the
progressives, liberals, even &quot;the far left.&quot; So when they hear about his or
Congressional Democrats'  policies, or get their lives touched by their
fallout, (e.g. his and their  support for trillions of dollars to the banks
and large corporations but only symbolic acts to stop the millions of home
foreclosures and to create jobs; his war in Afghanistan; his allowing the
oil and gas conglomerates to ruin the environment through drilling on the
coasts of many American states; his abandonment of his promises to end the
human rights abuses of the Bush Administration; and the list goes on), many
people become disillusioned, and blame the whole mess created by global
capitalism on &quot;big government,&quot; thus giving an amazing opening both to the
Tea Party movement and to the large business and financial interests.

&gt;<i>From the standpoint of the large corporate interests, nothing could be
</I>better than to de-fund government or dramatically downsize it, because then
it can't constrain their economic power. But if the Democrats aren't
constraining that power anyway, and people think of them as championing big
government that seems in bed with those corporate powers, they find the
anti-government sentiments of Tea Party people to be appealing, and are even
willing to turn their heads away and not pay attention when some of those
Tea Partyers reveal an extreme racism or even a quasi-fascist attraction to
militarism and denial of human rights.

So here is the problem: we have to both protect the liberals from the anger
their policies have generated, because we don't want the quasi-fascists to
take their place, and yet the only way we can effectively protect the
liberals is to openly criticize what is misguided in their policies, and to
put forward an alternative that really embodies the best in liberal and
progressive thought.

*The Invitation*


This is one of the major themes of the Tikkun/Network of Spiritual
Progressives (NSP) conference June 11-14.So I am writing you to invite you
to come to that conference and to the demonstration we plan at the White
House on June 13th.

We need you to be there to participate with us in bringing this kind of
thinking into the public arena. We will also focus on a. An Environmental
and Social Responsibility Amendment (ESRA) to the  Constitution to restrain
corporate power over elections and to re-empower democracy. b. The Global
Marshall Plan  c. Developing strategies for how to pursue progressive
politics in the Obama era  d. How to help progressives reclaim the moral
high ground by incorporating some of the leading ideas of the Network of
Spiritual Progressives, particularly our &quot;New Bottom Line.&quot;  .

*The cut off date for the lower cost pre-registration sliding scale for the
conference is April 10.*  Please register for it now at the lower cost
prices by going to

So, to restate the problem we will be addressing with your help:

On the one hand, a racist and quasi fascist movement seeks to overthrow the
Democrats and Obama and substitute more militarist and pro-corporate
policies. On the other hand a Democratic Party and president who push
policies that serve the interests of big pharm, insurance, and Wall Street,
provide no coherent alternative worldview, support huge military budgets and
a health care plan that further entrenches the private health care
profiteer,  while giving only token help to middle income and poor
people-thereby increasing the suffering of many Americans and making them
more receptive to the message of the racists and fascists. We in the
progressive world need a strategy to build a movement  for the Obama years
that recognizes the need to defend the liberals and Obama even as they
undermine themselves, and yet doesn't get identified with those flawed
policies. And we need a way to go beyond the technocratic language of
inside-the-beltway &quot;realistic&quot; politics and to affirm a vision of a world
based on generosity, love, non-violence, caring for others, ecological and
ethical sensitivity, and awe and wonder at the grandeur of the universe. We
call this &quot;Spiritual Progressive&quot; politics, and we are bringing together
people who want to think in these larger terms to a conference co-sponsored
by The Nation and many others!

*I so deeply hope that you will be able to come to help us re-invigorate the
Network of Spiritual Progressives and play a significant role in giving to
liberals and progressives the kind of help that we all so badly need to make
American politics a little more healthy, sane, and humane. And frankly, your
presence there, just BEING THERE, will make it easier for the media and even
others in our movement to take seriously the ideas that we will be putting
forward!!! Click here to register or go to: **
