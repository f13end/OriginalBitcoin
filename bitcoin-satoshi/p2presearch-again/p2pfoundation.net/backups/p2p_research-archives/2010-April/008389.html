&gt;<i> Hiya,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blond poses as radical and 'outside', but basically he is an ideologue of
</I>&gt;<i> the mainstream.  he has recognised a very real problem that the British
</I>&gt;<i> state is separated from society, but he misdiagnoses the problem in the
</I>&gt;<i> ideology of the party in power, when in fact it is a structural problem.
</I>&gt;<i> The difficulty is that, if the neototalitarian substitution of state for
</I>&gt;<i> society and the decomposition of everyday social relations through
</I>&gt;<i> repressive forms of governmentality are not addressed, the three problems
</I>&gt;<i> Blond identifies - a top-heavy state, a fragmented and atomised society, and
</I>&gt;<i> a drastic split between the two - remain insoluble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blond's doctrine is remarkably similar to the mainstream of Blairism: here,
</I>&gt;<i> too, communities are to be put at the centre of politics, and the state is
</I>&gt;<i> incited to re-moralise social life and rebuild shattered communities
</I>&gt;<i> (witness ideas such as the 'Respect' initiative, the idea of opposing
</I>&gt;<i> 'parallel lives' and breakaway communities, the 'inclusion' agenda, the
</I>&gt;<i> promotion of 'citizenship' in schooos...).  Hence, the pattern is simply
</I>&gt;<i> repeated.  The neototalitarian imaginary which has taken over the mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> in Britain, and which permits little dissent within accepted frames, is
</I>&gt;<i> based on the idea that something is fundamentally wrong with society and
</I>&gt;<i> that the state needs to take action to solve it - restricted of course by
</I>&gt;<i> the requirements that the state be neoliberal and repressive, hence that the
</I>&gt;<i> means it uses are rather curtailed in variety but extremely intrusive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, British political discourse is largely structured around a mixture
</I>&gt;<i> of repression and trauma.  Britain went through an authoritarian moment in
</I>&gt;<i> the mid-80s when political options were foreclosed, and political space has
</I>&gt;<i> never been re-opened since this point.  Britain is thus in a similar
</I>&gt;<i> position to post-authoritarian societies in which the past has not really
</I>&gt;<i> been overcome, but has become unspeakable (e.g. Chile).  The state 'seceded'
</I>&gt;<i> from society in this period by adopting authoritarian forms to smash social
</I>&gt;<i> movements, and since this point, the drift in executive authority and
</I>&gt;<i> state-society distance has worsened.  (This has been articulated in a frame
</I>&gt;<i> limited to the Blair period by Oborne).  In some ways, it is a classic
</I>&gt;<i> Bonapartist scenario - the Establishment let loose its reins on the state to
</I>&gt;<i> allow the state to smash opponents it no longer had the power to defeat
</I>&gt;<i> itself; in doing so, it also gave the state control over the Establishment
</I>&gt;<i> itself, leading to a reconstellation of social forces with the 'political
</I>&gt;<i> class' rendered autonomous and at the top.  This corresponds with a
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneous restructuring of capital away from social insertion and towards
</I>&gt;<i> externally-oriented finance and the 'global city' model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, Britain is in effect 'occupied' by a political class and its
</I>&gt;<i> apparatuses, in alliance with a transnational capitalist grouping with
</I>&gt;<i> little connection to Britain.  This has led to the decomposition of old
</I>&gt;<i> forms of social insertion, both sociological and imaginary.  The majority
</I>&gt;<i> have experienced this trauma as loss (some in the first period - the death
</I>&gt;<i> of Old Labour, some in the second - the loss of Establishment patronage and
</I>&gt;<i> Old Britain), but the loss has not been recognised as such, since to do so
</I>&gt;<i> would require challenging the very pervasive ideological presentation of the
</I>&gt;<i> transition either as continuity (Britain is and always will be a liberal
</I>&gt;<i> democracy) or progress (Britain moved out of the old era of destructive
</I>&gt;<i> ideological conflict).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This all makes sense when viewed in terms of Kropotkin's 'political' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'social principles': the 'political principle' seizes increasing power at
</I>&gt;<i> the expense of the 'social principle'; society is recomposed in
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian ways, and as a result, everyday horizontal connections are
</I>&gt;<i> either decomposed or reclassified as anti-social/subversive.  The history of
</I>&gt;<i> Britain since the mid-80s is a history of a series of further attacks on the
</I>&gt;<i> 'social principle', from the Criminal Justice Act (partying and protesting
</I>&gt;<i> is anti-social) to 'dispersal zones' (congregating with one or more other
</I>&gt;<i> people is anti-social), 'New Public Management' (breaking the social
</I>&gt;<i> principle within professions and public service bodies through surveillance
</I>&gt;<i> and *gleichschaltung*) to rearrangements of public space (attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> coopt spatial users into a regulation based on fear).  Notice also the
</I>&gt;<i> decline in political engagement - falling party memberships, falling voting
</I>&gt;<i> figures, reduced newspaper readerships and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, this leads to a situation where people experience a lack of
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal connections, permanent fear of arbitrary power and of horizontal
</I>&gt;<i> but desituated Others, a lack of community, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The logical way of responding to such awareness is to bemoan the 80s
</I>&gt;<i> counterrevolution and its subsequent continuation, to condemn the continued
</I>&gt;<i> rule of the 'political class' and to demand a *reversal* of the
</I>&gt;<i> transitions which have composed an increasingly authoritarian state.  Yet
</I>&gt;<i> this would raise old traumas - one would effectively have to admit that *Thatcher
</I>&gt;<i> needed to be beaten* in the mid-80s, that the foreclosed possibilities are
</I>&gt;<i> markers of the necessities of political openness.  One would also have to
</I>&gt;<i> reverse the dominant valorisations in public discourse today - for instance,
</I>&gt;<i> to value freedom in public spaces (as a condition for horizontal
</I>&gt;<i> composition) rather than regulation of public spaces for 'security'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such a logical response is blocked by the dominant ideology and its effects
</I>&gt;<i> - it has in effect been rendered unthinkable, and the trauma is 'repressed'
</I>&gt;<i> (while remaining active as a Real).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the trauma unresolved, it has been refracted ideologically through the
</I>&gt;<i> technique of identifying Others viewed as the barrier between an imagined
</I>&gt;<i> harmonious past or pure essence and the actuality of 'broken Britain' -
</I>&gt;<i> criminals, 'chavs', migrants, political dissidents, etc, and corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> discourses on cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism, human rights etc - creating
</I>&gt;<i> a climate of fear where people dare not think outside dominant categories.
</I>&gt;<i> (This was a discourse unleashed initially by the political class itself, as
</I>&gt;<i> a way of legitimating authoritarianism - see Hall's 'Policing the Crisis' -
</I>&gt;<i> but it has taken on a dynamic of its own through its connection to the
</I>&gt;<i> news-value-seeking logic of the tabloids, and ultimately becomes
</I>&gt;<i> disciplinary against individual politicians who are always under criticism
</I>&gt;<i> for not being tough or effective enough, even while clearly reinforcing the
</I>&gt;<i> total system).  The result is a 'choiceless democracy' (or polyarchy) -
</I>&gt;<i> parties which are extensions of the deep state compete to appear as the best
</I>&gt;<i> bearer or articulator of the homogeneous official ideology.  No movement
</I>&gt;<i> from this ideology is possible without slipping precariously close to
</I>&gt;<i> categories of exclusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means, among other things, that any effective response to social
</I>&gt;<i> decomposition is foreclosed in advance or rendered as intolerable to the
</I>&gt;<i> dominant discourse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence a situation when *everyone* - even the regime leaders - admit that
</I>&gt;<i> something is wrong, that Britain is 'broken', that people are 'too atomised'
</I>&gt;<i> and show too little respect for each other, that the revolution of the 60s
</I>&gt;<i> and the counterrevolution of the 80s have 'gone too far', that certain
</I>&gt;<i> virtues have been lost in the recent transitions...  yet at the same time,
</I>&gt;<i> the persistent attempts to address these failings are 'utopian duplication',
</I>&gt;<i> simply repeating the nexus of the problem.  The solution to the effects of
</I>&gt;<i> the 'political principle' is taken to be... more of the 'political
</I>&gt;<i> principle'.  The critique of the system as too atomised, too split between
</I>&gt;<i> the state and society, too centralised, etc., becomes a *supplementary*critique - a necessary part of the dominant ideology, and not at all a
</I>&gt;<i> bearer of critical force.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (There is much more that could be said...  about the role in all this of
</I>&gt;<i> militarised masculinities for instance, which provide a transmission belt
</I>&gt;<i> from the 'mainstream' into the 'symptom' (of 'crime', violence, etc) which
</I>&gt;<i> is permanently disavowed.  But I think this is enough to situate Blond in
</I>&gt;<i> the conjuncture).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this context, we can situate Blond as someone who rehashes old themes in
</I>&gt;<i> a slightly rearranged configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Blond proposes are actually measures which retain or even strengthen
</I>&gt;<i> the neototalitarian state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take for instance the idea of loosening the reins still further on what he
</I>&gt;<i> calls 'frontline civil servants', people such as police, community wardens
</I>&gt;<i> and council officials, who already have draconian and vastly abused powers
</I>&gt;<i> (the ability to issue ASBOs banning any act they happen to disapprove of,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it is illegal; the ability to extort money under the pretext of
</I>&gt;<i> summary on-the-spot fines for vaguely defined public order offences, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> Of course the power of these petty incarnations of sovereignty will be
</I>&gt;<i> directed mainly at the various Others.  Hence also, an ideal of greater
</I>&gt;<i> community, but *enacted by the state*; furthermore, enacted by the state
</I>&gt;<i> using neoliberal/neototalitarian means, which basically come down to
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to coerce participation either directly or through economic
</I>&gt;<i> bribery/punishment - people will be forced to behave more communally, or
</I>&gt;<i> else their benefits will be cut off, they will be fined for being
</I>&gt;<i> anti-social or given ASBOs, etc.  What could it mean to loosen their reins
</I>&gt;<i> further?  I suspect it would mean eliminating the few remaining judicial
</I>&gt;<i> constraints - things like the duty on police to record instances of stop and
</I>&gt;<i> search, the prohibition on wardens using force/violence, and various
</I>&gt;<i> proportionality and human rights limits imposed by the courts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At most it might mean loosening New Public Management to a sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> degree to create a margin of 'discretion' - though this is unlikely to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented; if it were, it would generate at one degree remove a wave of
</I>&gt;<i> tabloid outcry over why this man who had gone on to kill had not been
</I>&gt;<i> charged for peeing in the street two years earlier, that suspected terrorist
</I>&gt;<i> had not been raided because some civil servant had decided a phoned-in
</I>&gt;<i> report was unreliable, or the other free party is left untouched because a
</I>&gt;<i> local official deems it is not really much of a nuisance (we are seeing this
</I>&gt;<i> already at an alarming tone of intensity with regard to social workers who
</I>&gt;<i> 'should have caught' various well-publicised cases of abuse, and people who
</I>&gt;<i> commit suicide after persistent bullying, where the media alleges police
</I>&gt;<i> inaction).  In tabloid discourse, a single failure to act - however
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable at the time - is always proof of a widespread and pervasive
</I>&gt;<i> culture of impunity, a sign of a systematic liberal bias at all levels of
</I>&gt;<i> the state (or inability to act due to human rights laws, etc) - however
</I>&gt;<i> statistically unlikely the response in question - and hence, politicians
</I>&gt;<i> complying with this discourse have to constantly build in surveillance
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms to make sure officials don't 'fail to act', that they always have
</I>&gt;<i> the legal power to act, etc.  So Cameron will end up saying to Blond: nice
</I>&gt;<i> idea, but unworkable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice also the centrality of the trope of overcoming left-right divisions:
</I>&gt;<i> Blond's 'red Toryism' is here indistinguishable from (pre-election) Blair's
</I>&gt;<i> 'Third Way' fusion of conservative and socialist values.  This is really a
</I>&gt;<i> way of identifying with the 'post-ideological' coordinates of the
</I>&gt;<i> 'post-politics' of political class rule - rejecting in practice both the
</I>&gt;<i> deep insertedness of conservatism and the social justice of
</I>&gt;<i> social-democracy, even while upholding them as ideals or goals.  (In a way,
</I>&gt;<i> these people are all children of Eurocommunism or perhaps of Deng Xiaoping).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, also, the attempt to pass off (or more worryingly perhaps, to *really
</I>&gt;<i> believe*) rather conventional, mainstream, unchallenging ideas lacking in
</I>&gt;<i> reflexivity or critical sense as 'radical', 'new', transformative, etc.  (In
</I>&gt;<i> African 'choiceless democracies', this takes a similar but simpler form:
</I>&gt;<i> 'change', the 'new', 'hope' and the like as empty slogans in their own
</I>&gt;<i> right).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, Blond's visibility is most likely a flash in the pan.  Cameron,
</I>&gt;<i> like Blair, is a creature of the political class (not the Establishment, and
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not 'society').  Image-conscious, and open to fusions with the
</I>&gt;<i> deep state and the tabloids, his space within the system is rather limited,
</I>&gt;<i> which will not stop him doing a lot of damage within the space it *does*give him.  Since members of the political class are driven by publicity and
</I>&gt;<i> official ideology first and foremost, they are not really responsive to
</I>&gt;<i> high-minded ideals.  Blond will likely vanish from the field just as quickly
</I>&gt;<i> as Blair's early intellectual referents such as Etzioni, Hudson and Field,
</I>&gt;<i> and his slogans vanish just as quickly as the 'Third Way', 'stakeholder
</I>&gt;<i> society' and their ilk.  In the political class, seeking a 'radical'
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual agenda is a political effect of seeking to mobilise discontent
</I>&gt;<i> with an existing regime in hope for change.  Their function is as
</I>&gt;<i> signifiers, not as guiding beacons.  And they lose their sign-value once a
</I>&gt;<i> regime is in power, since to call for 'radical' change then becomes to
</I>&gt;<i> question the continuities which have persisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While Blond's motivations may well be more credibly academic, Cameron will
</I>&gt;<i> have adopted him on the advice of spindoctors, for symbolic effect.  This
</I>&gt;<i> whole 'red Tory' line - characteristically kept at one degree of remove, so
</I>&gt;<i> Cameron can reap the benefits without the risks - is probably a rhetorical
</I>&gt;<i> response to the sad attempts by Blairites to roll out class politics as a
</I>&gt;<i> point-scorer against the Tories, attempts which the Tories have echoed (the
</I>&gt;<i> 'Whelanism' anti-union demo for instance), and which are equally absurd on
</I>&gt;<i> both sides.  Yet Cameron is vulnerable - he is from an extremely upper-class
</I>&gt;<i> background, ex-private school and part of an elite Oxford University
</I>&gt;<i> drinking club, and his Shadow Chancellor looks and sounds the archetypal
</I>&gt;<i> 'toff', not to mention the ever-visible Boris Johnson (the three of them
</I>&gt;<i> apparently drinking buddies at Oxford).  It is also possible that Cameron is
</I>&gt;<i> gearing up to form a national government with the Blairites, in the event of
</I>&gt;<i> a hung parliament (since the parties now have more in common with each other
</I>&gt;<i> than with the distinctly off-message Liberal Democrats).  This would explain
</I>&gt;<i> the 'Red Tory' stuff - emphasising similarities with Labour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look on a policy level, and Cameron is 'more of the same' - and I expect
</I>&gt;<i> worse around the corner.  Announced policies so far:  a massive attack on
</I>&gt;<i> squatters and travellers, including criminalising squatting in Britain for
</I>&gt;<i> the first time since the Norman Conquest; banning Hizb ut-Tahrir, despite
</I>&gt;<i> its lack of any connection to political violence, for holding views anathema
</I>&gt;<i> to the dominant ideology and the tabloids; and repealing the Human Rights
</I>&gt;<i> Act, the last judicial barrier to neototalitarianism, a barrier effectively
</I>&gt;<i> forced on Britain by the ECHR and the EU (and one which Cameron will have
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty doing without, unless he wishes to secede from Europe).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be the tip of the iceberg.  There are at least two other cases
</I>&gt;<i> where a 'Third Way' ostensibly socialist government was replaced by a
</I>&gt;<i> right-wing party after a long spell in government: Australia under
</I>&gt;<i> Hawke/Howard, and Spain under Gonzalez/Aznar.  In neither of these cases did
</I>&gt;<i> the rightists reverse any of the atrocities of the Third Way.  In both
</I>&gt;<i> cases, they started new onslaughts of their own - in Spain, this included
</I>&gt;<i> draconian attacks on opposition parties including the banning of Batasuna,
</I>&gt;<i> and vicious 'anti-terror' laws; in Australia, it included the privatisation
</I>&gt;<i> of universities, further attacks on union and protest rights, and finally
</I>&gt;<i> the atrocity of the 'intervention' in which entire Aboriginal communities
</I>&gt;<i> suffered colonial occupation and moral policing.  In neither case did the
</I>&gt;<i> rightists have much of an electoral margin; in both cases they were replaced
</I>&gt;<i> within a couple of elections, and in both cases there was a popular upsurge
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding, I suspect, to the cutting loose of groups bought off through
</I>&gt;<i> patronage under the 'Third Way'.  In both cases, the Labour equivalent moved
</I>&gt;<i> back to the left in its rhetoric to gain re-election.  But in neither case
</I>&gt;<i> did it do anything progressive in turn, once re-elected.  Aussie Labour's
</I>&gt;<i> flagship policy at the moment is to impose a Chinese-style blanket firewall
</I>&gt;<i> on the Australian section of the Internet.  The PSOE has yet again gone
</I>&gt;<i> after squatters, seeking to clear all squats from Madrid (though after a few
</I>&gt;<i> pitched battles I daresay it has backed off).  One could refer similarly in
</I>&gt;<i> this context to the Reagan-Clinton-Bush-Obama series; and to the persistent
</I>&gt;<i> rotation of two deep-state parties which lasted decades in Turkey.  In
</I>&gt;<i> short, once a neototalitarian system is locked into a political system, it
</I>&gt;<i> is not easy to break out of it; certainly the movements of mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> parties do not cause such a shift.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  *David Brooks* explains&lt;<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/opinion/19brooks.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/opinion/19brooks.html</A>&gt;the ideas of the Conservative British writer Phillip Blond:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&#8220;Blond argues that over the past generation we have witnessed two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolutions, both of which liberated the individual and decimated local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associations. First, there was a revolution from the left: a cultural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolution that displaced traditional manners and mores; a legal revolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that emphasized individual rights instead of responsibilities; a welfare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revolution in which social workers displaced mutual aid societies and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-organized associations.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Then there was the market revolution from the right. In the age of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deregulation, giant chains like Wal-Mart decimated local shop owners. Global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> financial markets took over small banks, so that the local knowledge of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> town banker was replaced by a manic herd of traders thousands of miles away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unions withered.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The two revolutions talked the language of individual freedom, but they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perversely ended up creating greater centralization. They created an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> atomized, segmented society and then the state had to come in and attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repair the damage.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The free-market revolution didn&#8217;t create the pluralistic decentralized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economy. It created a centralized financial monoculture, which requires a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gigantic government to audit its activities. The effort to liberate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals from repressive social constraints didn&#8217;t produce a flowering of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom; it weakened families, increased out-of-wedlock births and turned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbors into strangers. In Britain, you get a country with rising crime,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and, as a result, four million security cameras.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *In a much-discussed essay in Prospect magazine in February 2009, Blond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrote, &#8220;Look at the society we have become: We are a bi-polar nation, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bureaucratic, centralised state that presides dysfunctionally over an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasingly fragmented, disempowered and isolated citizenry.&#8221; In a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essay, he added, &#8220;The welfare state and the market state are now two defunct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mutually supporting failures.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The task today, he argued in a recent speech, is to revive the sector
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the two revolutions have mutually decimated: &#8220;The project of radical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transformative conservatism is nothing less than the restoration and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creation of human association, and the elevation of society and the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who form it to their proper central and sovereign station.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Economically, Blond lays out three big areas of reform: remoralize the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market, relocalize the economy and recapitalize the poor. This would mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passing zoning legislation to give small shopkeepers a shot against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retail giants, reducing barriers to entry for new businesses, revitalizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local banks, encouraging employee share ownership, setting up local capital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funds so community associations could invest in local enterprises, rewarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> savings, cutting regulations that socialize risk and privatize profit, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reducing the subsidies that flow from big government and big business.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *To create a civil state, Blond would reduce the power of senior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government officials and widen the discretion of front-line civil servants,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people actually working in neighborhoods. He would decentralize power,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> giving more budget authority to the smallest units of government. He would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funnel more services through charities. He would increase investments in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure, so that more places could be vibrant economic hubs. He would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rebuild the &#8220;village college&#8221; so that universities would be more intertwined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the towns around them.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Essentially, Blond would take a political culture that has been oriented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around individual choice and replace it with one oriented around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationships and associations. His ideas have made a big splash in Britain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the past year. His think tank, ResPublica, is influential with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conservative Party. His book, &#8220;Red Tory,&#8221; is coming out soon.&#8221;*
