&gt;<i> Hiya,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't read the book, but just looked up a summary.  So don't quote me
</I>&gt;<i> on this first section!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to be connected to their view of biopolitics/biopower.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> always found their view of biopolitics/biopower rather insubstantial
</I>&gt;<i> compared to Foucault's.  They're a bit inclined to pick up poststructuralist
</I>&gt;<i> terminology without much sense of its distinct meaning, and deploy it in
</I>&gt;<i> rather dubious ways.  If I understand them, biopower is the collective power
</I>&gt;<i> of the multitude (constitutive power), whereas biopolitics is the
</I>&gt;<i> exploitation of this power by Empire (constituted power).  This hasn't got
</I>&gt;<i> much to do with the body, since biopower is also about meanings, affects,
</I>&gt;<i> immaterial labour, the general intellect, etc.  So I would expect this new
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis on the body to also be rather insubstantial.  They might have in
</I>&gt;<i> mind the idea that Empire has to be resisted physically, as in Ya Basta type
</I>&gt;<i> tactics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More broadly, the politics of the 'body' is associated with
</I>&gt;<i> poststructuralism and postfeminism, and is quite widespread in certain
</I>&gt;<i> fields of cultural studies/critical theory.  It follows from the classic
</I>&gt;<i> poststructuralist strategy of deconstructing binaries.  In postfeminism, it
</I>&gt;<i> is argued that men are associated with mind and women with body, hence that
</I>&gt;<i> women's empowerment must come through revaluing of the body.  In Foucault,
</I>&gt;<i> the body and biopolitics/biopower are associated with regimes of confinement
</I>&gt;<i> and restriction of bodies, of the production of 'docile bodies', usually
</I>&gt;<i> through means of coercively acting on bodies in such a way as to bypass the
</I>&gt;<i> mind and 'soul' (for instance, prolonged confinement, physical shackling,
</I>&gt;<i> mind-numbing routine).  In Deleuze there is the 'body without organs' and
</I>&gt;<i> the separation between 'molar' and 'molecular' selves.  The 'body without
</I>&gt;<i> organs' is an embodied experience of immediacy without division, while
</I>&gt;<i> 'molar' selves are imaginary unified selves separate from people's actual
</I>&gt;<i> 'molecular' constitution as collections of flows and becomings.  Judith
</I>&gt;<i> Butler has written a book 'Bodies that Matter' which is rather influential.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the body in Butler is connected to the idea that identities are
</I>&gt;<i> performed (socially) rather than inherent - hence identities are expressed
</I>&gt;<i> through the body.  Donna Haraway is another major figure - she argues that
</I>&gt;<i> identities are altered by the 'hybridising' of bodies through the use of
</I>&gt;<i> material props and adjuncts, such as wheelchairs.  In a lot of the secondary
</I>&gt;<i> works, these various distinct meanings get melded together.  A lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> use of the body in poststructuralist writings is also rather metaphorical -
</I>&gt;<i> one finds social bodies, political bodies, bodies of evidence and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> One also finds claims that for instance, the body can bear memories and
</I>&gt;<i> scars of what the mind has forgotten.  This carries a sense of the
</I>&gt;<i> psychoanalytic idea of hysterical symptoms.  Sometimes the body also
</I>&gt;<i> encompasses matters such as desire, emotion/affect, etc - as in the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> 'embodied subjects'.  An 'embodied subject' is a subject who feels, desires,
</I>&gt;<i> etc., as distinct from the abstract subjects of liberal theory.  An abstract
</I>&gt;<i> concept can also be 'embodied' through being brought into a particular
</I>&gt;<i> setting (hence people might be said to be 'embodying' the nation, democracy,
</I>&gt;<i> etc., by giving it a performative reality - one might find phrases such as
</I>&gt;<i> 'the experience of trench warfare as embodiment of modern nationalism' for
</I>&gt;<i> instance).  The turn to the 'body' can also be a reaction against the
</I>&gt;<i> prevalence of social-constructionism, and an insistence that practices such
</I>&gt;<i> as violence have a 'reality' on a level which is not simply socio-symbolic.
</I>&gt;<i> This is particularly important in critiques of gender violence and of
</I>&gt;<i> colonialism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to only going half the way - poststructuralists are quite divided as to
</I>&gt;<i> how politically radical or otherwise they are...  They all like to seem
</I>&gt;<i> radical, but quite a few of them - particularly the secondary exegetes and
</I>&gt;<i> appliers of the theories - are actually rather conservative, or Third Way.
</I>&gt;<i> They have a certain aversion to antagonism, instantly dismiss anything 'too'
</I>&gt;<i> radical as 'essentialist', and see their work as a never-ending process of
</I>&gt;<i> unpacking, problematising and uncovering the implications of a dominant
</I>&gt;<i> logic they don't really believe will ever change.  Hence their main role is
</I>&gt;<i> to point to what is elided - in this case the body - rather than
</I>&gt;<i> reconstructing any kind of 'beyond'.  There are others, among the second
</I>&gt;<i> tier as well as many of the founders, who are extremely radical, attached to
</I>&gt;<i> something akin to an autonomist politics in which hierarchies are to be
</I>&gt;<i> permanently destroyed and relations are instead to be constructed on a
</I>&gt;<i> networked basis (very much p2p politics).  In these kinds of theories, one
</I>&gt;<i> would find something very similar to what you suggest of 70s/80s
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation: the aim is to go beyond the separation of mind, body and
</I>&gt;<i> spirit towards an experience which is more immanent, intense and holistic
</I>&gt;<i> (body without organs is conceived along these lines; in Foucault's case it
</I>&gt;<i> would be the ethics of care for the self which plays a similar role).  Where
</I>&gt;<i> do Hardt and Negri fit in?  I'm not entirely sure.  They aren't really
</I>&gt;<i> immanentists in the Deleuzian sense, they are far too committed to unity for
</I>&gt;<i> this.  On the other hand, they're not really 'endless task of critique'
</I>&gt;<i> types either.  They believe some kind of social change is possible.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> read Empire and Multitude and I get a strong sense that they're actually
</I>&gt;<i> rather classically Marxist: labour is the basis of social life, capital
</I>&gt;<i> exploits labour, labour needs to free itself from capital and actualise
</I>&gt;<i> itself as a (unitary) new society, except that today labour is networked and
</I>&gt;<i> immaterial, and now apparently embodied too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hardt and Negri's implications for peer-to-peer politics are relatively
</I>&gt;<i> clear: they see networked activity as socially productive labour, they
</I>&gt;<i> believe contemporary capitalism is exploiting the totality of networked
</I>&gt;<i> activity, but that this activity is irreducible to capitalism and that it
</I>&gt;<i> can form the basis of a liberated society, which would be an entirely
</I>&gt;<i> networked society which nevertheless operates as a totality and produces
</I>&gt;<i> outcomes which operate akin to decisions.  I think they're a little naive
</I>&gt;<i> about how peer-to-peer networks actually work, and in particular, that they
</I>&gt;<i> wrongly assume that all networks necessarily form an integrated meta-network
</I>&gt;<i> (simply because they all involve social labour) and that this meta-network
</I>&gt;<i> is something like an integrated whole whose parts display a kind of
</I>&gt;<i> unity-in-difference.  In actual networks there are forks, branchings,
</I>&gt;<i> schisms, crypto-hierarchies, issues of the emergence of reactive formations,
</I>&gt;<i> cyber-chiefs...  it's a lot more complicated than Hardt and Negri seem to
</I>&gt;<i> realise.  They seem to think that if capital/Empire was eliminated, the
</I>&gt;<i> world would just be one big happy network.  They're particularly reluctant
</I>&gt;<i> to get into the plane of psychological repression and reactive desire, which
</I>&gt;<i> persist as problems even when networks are *formally* open and
</I>&gt;<i> non-hierarchical.  Networks construct diffuse power, but structures of
</I>&gt;<i> desire determine how and to what ends people will use the diffuse power they
</I>&gt;<i> obtain within networks.  Hardt and Negri instead assume something like a
</I>&gt;<i> unity of will, a recurrence of the old 'species-being' idea I suspect.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Andy and others,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m reading Commonwealth from Negri and Hardt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the first chapter, they discuss the turn to the standpoint of bodies. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a hard time understanding what this means. What I understand is that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> central category of Marxism was &#8216;consciousness&#8217;, so a shift to the body
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes some sense. N/H also relate it to the shift to the point of view of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the struggles (Tronti), subaltern studies, and castoriadis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some context. Part of my generation in the seventies and eighties, who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> felt divorced from our bodies and others, undertook an intensive path of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going back to the body, a &#8216;regression in service of the ego&#8217; if you like,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but the aim was re-integration in the body-mind, or better yet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> body-mind-spirit. So the turn to the body, the emotional and instinctual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> body, to the relatedness in group dynamics, was, at least in the best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts, geared towards re-integration in a higher unity. (I&#8217;m by no means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claiming that all these efforts were successful, and indeed a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regressive efforts in that sense led to spiritual authoritarianism, aided by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the suspension of critical cognitive functions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this context, a language of a return to the body seems regressive, an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indication that only half the effort has been done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But of course, this interpretation which comes from juxtaposing two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different cultural contexts may make no sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, to relate a personal experience, in the recent greek meeting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around Mignet, which some of you may know went very badly, all the talk was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the &#8216;body&#8217;, yet, I have never seen people so divorced from their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bodies and stuck in cognicentrism as in these kind of social milieus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I&#8217;m puzzled, what is this turn to the standpoint of the body, what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does it mean politically, or is it just an ideological compensation from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isolated and cognicentric academics?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To what degree are these just compensatory language games, to what degree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is this a serious turn with practical consequences?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any impact on a peer to peer understanding of our world.
