<PRE>I agree Sam, moving it to a more collective place preserves the value of the
discussion for people who may be interested in it later, and who don't know
about this private discussion,

&gt;<i> Marco,

</I>&gt;<i> I think we might actually make some progress if we move this discussion to
</I>&gt;<i> the p2pfoundation wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way, instead of point-counter-point arguing with each other, we might
</I>&gt;<i> instead come to better understanding of multiple perspectives, and others
</I>&gt;<i> reading this won't have to sift through our email threads to get the key
</I>&gt;<i> points (I admit I am just as guilty of making the thread dense as anyone).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to summarize it here
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Arguments_against_copyrigthless_creative_output">http://p2pfoundation.net/Arguments_against_copyrigthless_creative_output</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and you can jump in and edit the page and correct me wherever you see that
</I>&gt;<i> I have it wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think any of us are actually really arguing against your central
</I>&gt;<i> core point, which is that completely tossing aside any declaration of usage
</I>&gt;<i> by others is potentially a bad idea. I agree with this, and as you mention,
</I>&gt;<i> creative commons, and other licenses are based around the default of total
</I>&gt;<i> copyright, with nuanced permissions granted by the creator. Indeed, common
</I>&gt;<i> law in many countries often assumes this, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, that is what I read as your central point, that we should not
</I>&gt;<i> necassarily turn that on it's head, but that maybe we should instead educate
</I>&gt;<i> people, give them literacies about how they can work with existing
</I>&gt;<i> conditions, instead of inverting them by default, invert them per person's
</I>&gt;<i> choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that is the gist of what you are saying, it makes sense to me. I think
</I>&gt;<i> we agree on this point, and it seems to one of your core points. Please
</I>&gt;<i> correct me if I am wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, I will have to address your blog posts point by point when I
</I>&gt;<i> have time, and I think that I can do it better in a wiki page that we can
</I>&gt;<i> both edit, than in an email thread, so if you agree I'll create one page on
</I>&gt;<i> p2p wiki that tries to faithfully summarize your arguments (unless there
</I>&gt;<i> already is one) then I will create another that critiques your arguments,
</I>&gt;<i> with citations that can back up what I am asserting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully you'll see this a bit more fair than the indirect ciriticism
</I>&gt;<i> that has taken place on this list so far (and maybe more useful).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Greetings, everybody, and thanks to Michel for the interest in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thoughts and the invitation to discuss them here. I had said I'd wait
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a week to answer to finish other work, but the discussion is just too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interesting to wait.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some general points before I answer in detail to some of your comments:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) I have changed the subject because I don't think the one Michel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   used to present my article reflects its main point. I'm not saying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   that open/free doesn't apply to other content. I'm saying that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   arguments usually brought to the table to say that copyright should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   be abolished altogether seem much less solid or general than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   advertised
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) I'd suggest to please read again <A HREF="http://digifreedom.net/node/58">http://digifreedom.net/node/58</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   <A HREF="http://digifreedom.net/node/59">http://digifreedom.net/node/59</A> before answering to the comments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   which follow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c) Before answering, I've read all the messages in this thread so far,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   and I already knew all or almost all the counter-arguments. With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   all respect, I'm not really interested in knowing and investigating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   more about music and musicians. Not now, at least, and I'll dare to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   suggest that focusing there may not be the most effective strategy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   to fix copyright problems. I've published some thoughts about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   _copyright_, not about music and musicians. I have just been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   forced, you may say, to include music and musicians in the piece
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   because that's just what I've often found repeated without enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Several things I've written may be summed up as &quot;whatever the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   thing to do about copyright is, maybe the idea that you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   generalize to all creative activities what has been proved to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   quite well for musicians is a myth, or at least it needs much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   investigation to be accepted&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Copyright or its abolition impact much more than music. Fixing this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   problem in a way that works wonders for musicians may be...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   suboptimal, much like fixing the problems created by proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   software or software patents in a way and inside a mental framework
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (the GNU/FSF way and framework) made to order on the brains and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   interests of enthusiast programmers, that is of a tiny, terribly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   tiny minority of all computer users of today. I already knew that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   musicians can live well (if not better), without ever doing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;all rights reserved&quot; thing, thank you. What I ask in my first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   article is, &quot;are you really sure this is equally true for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   creative activities, or that abolishing copyright because musicians
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   would be better off without it is really necessary and effective&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; d) I've seen the word &quot;artist&quot; thrown around a lot in this thread, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   I've done the same myself. However, unless explicitly noted, I use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the terms artists, author, creator as perfect synonyms in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   context. I suggest it is crucial to keep in minds all these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   meanings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Because, again, copyright impacts on, or covers, much more than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   music: music, pictures, source code, novels, technical manuals,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   lyrics, text-books, movies, stock market analyses and so on. Trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   to separate all these activities, by finding a separate solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for each of them, is both intrinsically wrong and practically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   impossible. So you must look for a solution which is feasible and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   works decently for all the involved activities, from real peaks of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   artistic inspiration to very prosaic and boring texts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This said, I'll now answer some specific points of your messages:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Samuel wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Most our argument seems to boil down to getting rid of copyright,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; vs. keeping it, and &quot;myths&quot; that you think people have or perceive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about these issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most of my first article is simply &quot;whatever should happen to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copyright, the &quot;facts&quot; that people usually quote as natural truth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; against it are much weaker and/or less general than they seem&quot;. And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's not a perception of mine at all: that article is little more than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a reformatting of things that any number of people have *actually*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; said to me as &quot;facts&quot;, often accepting them without any thinking, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of my answers. One of the reasons I wrote that piece is that I had had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to repeat those things so often that I thought I may save some time in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the future by just handing a link and the number of the answer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think you should do some talking to artists, and musicians who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; make a living from art/music, you may be surprised about their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; attitudes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see point c) above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think you are wrong that saying that &quot;side jobs don't even count
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in discussing these issues&quot;. Maybe they do not count for you, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; they sure as hell count for me. There is absolutely no reason not to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; consider *anyone* who is making money, and decisions about making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; money as an artist/musician/creative, into the equation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is probably a misunderstanding here, sorry. I meant &quot;side jobs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the artist&quot;, as is &quot;let's ignore the assumption that creative work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should just happen as a part time activity, while the artist's food
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and shelter are paid by a non-creative job of the artist&quot;. I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refer at all to other jobs of other people around the artists, working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for or thanks to the artist himself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The ways that you discuss are not the only ways to survive as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; artist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Did I said they are the only ones? Where? I said let's not exclude any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single way, not even those coming from a (reformed, see second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; article!!!)  copyright.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the times when most independent artists are able to charge multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; license charges from one piece of work are often far less than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; money they make from producing unique works for individual paying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; clients.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pray elaborate on how this is really applicable for all kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artists (cfr what I wrote in Myth 3) and above all on how maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a reformed copyright would _prevent_ this (which again was the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; central, if not only, point of my article)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in real practice, and in the emerging media ecology, there are more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ways to make a living from creative works than just encircling them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with copyright and demanding that any and all users pay you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please point to where I _deny_ this fact altogether. I say something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different: a) it is not true that this is equally effective and enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for all kind of creative works; b) there is no reason and no harm to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not let the two (all) models coexist, not if copyright is reformed as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suggest in my second article.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stan wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. You say &quot;But if this is the _only_ way to survive for an artist,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if an artist cannot be just an artist full time, with as little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; powerful patrons and intermediaries as possible... it isn't a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing for society as a whole, we haven't progressed all that much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; since the middle ages&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This assumes the artists are all of sufficient value to society to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; earn a livelihood.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe all this and similar discussions are *only* about artists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who indeed are or could be of sufficient value to society. Why should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we care about the others? They'd disappear very soon anyway, whatever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the model is, and would disappear much sooner or almost never appear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by reforming copyright as I suggest, something which would make the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current corporate behemots who push such artists today completely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unattractive to investors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  1. Distribution of information--nonrival goods--is continually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   approaching zero cost.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what? Production of quality information, that is presence and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constant, continuous, focused use of talent, is not going to be worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less or approach zero needed time anytime before we all turn into pure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; energy. If I'm a loser and create something worthless, I'll soon be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forced to change activity and it doesn't matter which model I tried or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had available. Let's just ignore that scenario.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if I'm really good and it takes me twelve months full time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce the best novel ever written or the clearest text book since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the invention of the alphabet, is it really wrong if I (have the law
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structures in place to) demand a contribution IF I WANT and/or NEED
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IT, always in the reformed copyright context I suggest, directly by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every end user of my work and nobody else, to cover at least my cost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of living for those twelve months?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does having this possibility forbids me to go with Creative Commons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for that or future or previous works or with donations, patrons,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever? Do you really HAVE to abolish the most direct, simpler and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fairest way to cover my costs (because that's what copyright would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grant in my scenario, not some faceless stock holders) only because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are other ways, which yes, are probably much more effective...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for musicians?  Is it really NECESSARY??
