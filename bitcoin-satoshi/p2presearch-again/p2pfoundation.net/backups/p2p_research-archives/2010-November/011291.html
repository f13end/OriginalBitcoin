<PRE>Hi Roberto,

thank you so much for this informed contribution, from someone &quot;in the
field&quot;,

I would like to reproduce this in our blog, if that is okay with you,

Michel

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Take control: log off, leave the keyboard, occupy land - at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support those who do, such as the MST; i.e. outspoken support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> landless, peasants and indigenous movements who work for common control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over land is essential. At the moment a lot of free culture does the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very opposite: speaks of immateriality, sucks up to IT corporations and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears to be allergic to stances that confront the power of capital (as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we heard time and again in Berlin).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You point out a real dilemma. I'm based in the Philippines and have been an
</I>&gt;<i> activist both in the information and agriculture fields. Although I helped
</I>&gt;<i> introduce the Internet among Philippine NGOs, I eventually realized the dark
</I>&gt;<i> side of the Internet too, which I describe in detail in my book Towards a
</I>&gt;<i> Political Economy of Information (full text available here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://rverzola.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/infoeconomy-verzola.pdf">http://rverzola.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/infoeconomy-verzola.pdf</A>) and
</I>&gt;<i> several other pieces circulating online. I even went as far as &quot;logging
</I>&gt;<i> off&quot;, as you suggested (again, I describe this the book) and only
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally using Internet cafes for some searching and emailing. I did so
</I>&gt;<i> for around one year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I truly saw the dilemma. The Internet was so biased in favor of big
</I>&gt;<i> monopolists that to simply join it already made us markets for hardware,
</I>&gt;<i> software, connectivity, consultancies, etc. etc. So, we join and we already
</I>&gt;<i> lose. Yet, if we don't join we also lose by default, by not contesting what
</I>&gt;<i> is a growing arena of conflict and where rules and practices were being set
</I>&gt;<i> with hardly any public debate etc. Then there were the tools that we could
</I>&gt;<i> use (mainly the email, the egroups and the search engines) to reach some
</I>&gt;<i> people who would otherwise be beyond reach or too expensive to do so. We
</I>&gt;<i> could have stuck to faxing and overseas calls, but it didn't make sense. We
</I>&gt;<i> would lose likewise. Facjng such dilemma, I had to find some principled
</I>&gt;<i> balance. Today, I use paper and pencil a lot for drafts (I drafted my talk
</I>&gt;<i> at the Berlin ICC 2010 with paper and pencil), and I don't have a laptop.
</I>&gt;<i> But I still use a desktop and still type some drafts directly on the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard. However, I can think clearly even without my fingers on a
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard, which is not the case anymore with many people I know. I don't use
</I>&gt;<i> FaceBook or similar sites, but I use search engines a lot. (I don't own a
</I>&gt;<i> car either and rely on public transport, but when friends offer me a ride on
</I>&gt;<i> their car, I'm thankful. Maybe I still need to do things differently in the
</I>&gt;<i> future; balancing is a real dilemma.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my case. however, I decided that &quot;logging off&quot; was not an option. Since
</I>&gt;<i> you are on this list, it seems you have decided likewise not to &quot;log off&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious though if you have actually &quot;logged off&quot; yourself and if you
</I>&gt;<i> think that experience was a good long-term approach. I decided it wasn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the material/immaterial debate: you are right that the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet/cyberspace sits on a material medium. I was concerned about that
</I>&gt;<i> too and looked for ways that poor farmers in the Philippines might take
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of its benefits without the high costs. So we are experimenting
</I>&gt;<i> with SMS and CD players. I coordinate a farmers' network called
</I>&gt;<i> SRI-Pilipinas (SRI is system of rice intensification), where farmers text us
</I>&gt;<i> their mailing address then we send them by snail mail a free primer, and
</I>&gt;<i> then offer to send at minimum cost a training CD on SRI. We announce our
</I>&gt;<i> cellphone number via radio stations, because farmers can afford a $10
</I>&gt;<i> transistor radio (one-time cost) and about $1 a month for batteries. If they
</I>&gt;<i> don't have a cellphone (many do, because they have relatives  working as
</I>&gt;<i> overseas contract workers), they can ask a neighbor to send the SMS, and
</I>&gt;<i> there is usually one or a few VCD or DVD players even in the poorest
</I>&gt;<i> village. This program is still ongoing. Even in this situation, it is hard
</I>&gt;<i> *not to see* the benefits of &quot;intangibility&quot; -- the low cost of texting
</I>&gt;<i> (which admittedly can still be lower if the mobile ISPs were not so biased
</I>&gt;<i> against the poor) -- and the low cost of reproducing CDs/DVDs. The principle
</I>&gt;<i> we try to follow is we don't want to ask people to buy new hardware or
</I>&gt;<i> software. We want them to learn how to fully utilize the information tools
</I>&gt;<i> they already own or have access to. Again, there are all kinds of dilemmas
</I>&gt;<i> here, but the challenge, if you ask me, is to find the balance, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;log off&quot; and lose by default. I can imagine not using the Internet, but
</I>&gt;<i> distributing DVDs instead, if a village already has some DVD players, but no
</I>&gt;<i> Internet cafe. The demand to set up an Internet cafe will not come from me.
</I>&gt;<i> But when an entrepreneur sees a business opportunity, and sets up an
</I>&gt;<i> Internet cafe, which does provide lower-cost options for farmers (like
</I>&gt;<i> emailing their daughters abroad or talking to them on webcam, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> making overseas calls), I feel obligated to point out this lower-cost option
</I>&gt;<i> for farmers. The alternative is to watch them dissipate their hard-earned
</I>&gt;<i> money on older, more expensive methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also aware of the evils of technologies and have written about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Here in the Philippines, I led a 30-day hunger strike in 2003 against the
</I>&gt;<i> commercial introduction of Bt corn. I am also deeply involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> anti-nuclear campaign. Lines have to be drawn. I use the term &quot;human-scale&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> technologies on one hand, and technologies &quot;beyond human-scale&quot; on the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand. Nuclear technology and genetic engineering, I put under the latter,
</I>&gt;<i> because nuclear wastes that last tens or hundreds of thousands of years are
</I>&gt;<i> beyond the scale of the longevity of humans or even civilizations.
</I>&gt;<i> Engineered organisms, which reproduce, mutate, and evolve are also beyond
</I>&gt;<i> our capacity to control. I would probably put nanotechnology in the same
</I>&gt;<i> category (I need to read about it some more).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not ready to say though that information/communications technologies
</I>&gt;<i> are beyond human-scale to control and regulate. I don't think &quot;fab labs&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> beyond human-scale either. I could be wrong (I've been reading Ray
</I>&gt;<i> Kurzweil's The Singularity is Near), but perhaps not, based on my own
</I>&gt;<i> engagement with these technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been talking about the nature of the technologies themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> Ownership is of course another issue. If a technology is beyond human-scale,
</I>&gt;<i> ownership isn't very relevant, It wouldn't matter if the P2P Foundation were
</I>&gt;<i> the one running a nuclear plant or engineering a new bacterium. They would
</I>&gt;<i> still be beyond human-scale. But if a technology by nature problemmatic,
</I>&gt;<i> then ownership and/or control is a major issue, as someone else pointed out
</I>&gt;<i> here. One of the things I've advocated in my book is to turn the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures of cyberspace itself into community-owned facilities or into
</I>&gt;<i> commons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that our positions and analyses are colored by our own
</I>&gt;<i> experiences, so I can't insist that my experience is more valid than yours.
</I>&gt;<i> Among the Philippine Greens, we are wary of anyone who says theirs is the
</I>&gt;<i> only way out. We need a variety / range of strategies and approaches,
</I>&gt;<i> because people whose experiences vary may developed varied approaches too. I
</I>&gt;<i> think all the different alternative approaches (though, as I said above, we
</I>&gt;<i> have to draw a line somewhere), have to be given a chance to play themselves
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My concept of abundance, which has been criticized by some, is different
</I>&gt;<i> from the technologically deterministic cornucopian view represented by
</I>&gt;<i> Kurzweil in his Singularity book. I recognize the limits imposed by material
</I>&gt;<i> resources and I wrote in my paper at the Berlin ICC 2010 that abundance in
</I>&gt;<i> the industrial sector will need to emulate ecosystems and rely on close
</I>&gt;<i> material loops fuelled by renewable energy. If metals were treated as a flow
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a stock in closed material loops fuelled by renewable energy,
</I>&gt;<i> we'd need to worry less about the material limits. After all matter is never
</I>&gt;<i> destroyed: all the metals dug out of the earth in the past are mostly still
</I>&gt;<i> around. We just need to learn better how to use them in the context of
</I>&gt;<i> closed material loops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recognize the current ecological (and socio-economic) crisis of the
</I>&gt;<i> present. To put it simplistically, I would agree that the present is 90% bad
</I>&gt;<i> and 10% good (or whatever hi/lo number you might want to assign). It is fine
</I>&gt;<i> too that some want to focus their attention on the 90%. But I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> even better, describing the same present situation, to focus on the 10%.
</I>&gt;<i> There is even an approach called &quot;appreciative inquiry&quot; that has
</I>&gt;<i> systematized this way on focusing on the good as a strategy for overcoming
</I>&gt;<i> the bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, I disagree with those who would mechanically project the
</I>&gt;<i> present into the future. The future is NOT necessarily 90% bad and 10% good,
</I>&gt;<i> even if the present is. If we focus on the possibilities opened up by the
</I>&gt;<i> 10% (which is what I essentially did in my Berlin paper), we can help the
</I>&gt;<i> good grow, and who knows, if we work together hard enough, it might even
</I>&gt;<i> become the dominant feature in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While you might have met some people at the conference who &quot;suck up to IT
</I>&gt;<i> corporations&quot;, I don't think anyone who  posted any recent message on this
</I>&gt;<i> list meets the characterization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really be interested in continuing the dialogue between commoners who
</I>&gt;<i> work in the cyberspace realm, and those who work in the agriculture and
</I>&gt;<i> natural resources sector, especially since I straddle both realms and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> painfully aware of the dilemmas and differences. I think the Berlin ICC was
</I>&gt;<i> a good start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers, and warm greetings to all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Roberto
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Thinking honestly about the problem and refrain from misleading ideas,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as treating digital commons as immaterial. In other words, discuss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> philosophy and politics of organisation of digital commons as if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were, as they indeed are, very complex systems embedded deeply and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problematically in natural resource systems: i.e. acknowledge the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem, instead of glossing it over,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are not even at a problem solving stage yet, we are still deep in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> denial - nevermind the material aspect, just look at the widespread use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of, say, Facebook - which is a major agent of enclosure in cyberspace -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by virtual &quot;commoners&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once we are all on the same kind of page - this is *not* about ideology,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but acknowledgement of the material realities of the virtual and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power of capital - then let us move forward to the practical questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you pose. Meanwhile, we need to work on awareness and realisation - and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importantly: global solidarity, meaning that we have to move away from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Euro-centric conceptions of history, which supports a culture that never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has acknowledged very much where its riches came and continues to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from. Digital commons are parasites on natural resources and territories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of people elsewhere in the world in much the same way as supermarkets are.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When enough eyes see the materiality of the virtual, the hack might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emerge. We are far from that.
