<PRE>Dear Smari,

of course, I want to fully support you on this, but I have a serious issue
of timing, I just arrived in buenos aires, somewhat in a crisis mode as
something went wrong with the coordination, no pick up and no reservation at
the stated hotel, I need to solve this today, somewhat stressed you'll
understand, then, tomorrow, there is the keynote and 2 days of conferencing,
it's hard to say how much time I have.

Most quickly, what I can do is just re-use what you write now, first at
Ning, wait for someone to re-write it with some info about YOU, I can then
always add a paragraph about why this is a truly historical occasion (a true
p2p candidate, broader than single-issue oriented Pirate Party) then we
publish it on the blog, and once it is there, we can repeat a few rounds of
facebooking/twittering around the link,

If you want us to do more, feel free to ask, we'll try our best

As I said, for me, it's just bad timing when I'm on the road like this,

I copied the list, in the hope and confidence that others on the list agree
to support you even more, but I guess best is if you can provide material we
can work around by adding a supportive paragraph,

Don't hesitate to ask for anything, the worse that can happen is that people
say no thanks &lt;g&gt;

Michel

&gt;<i> Hi Michel, Simona,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In reference to our conversation in Barcelona about my candidacy for
</I>&gt;<i> the Icelandic Constitutional Assembly, I'm thinking that it's about time
</I>&gt;<i> to invoke the P2P culture and try and rally some external awareness and
</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What I'd suggest is if we can draft some kind of letter of endorsement
</I>&gt;<i> from the P2P community and get a bunch of signatures, then I could wave
</I>&gt;<i> that around here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A slightly more involved but potentially useful thing would be some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of video clip, just a talking heads thing, with somebody speaking
</I>&gt;<i> about the importance of understanding of networked societies and that
</I>&gt;<i> this understanding be incorporated into modern state structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And then of course there's the easiest thing to do, which is to click
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;like&quot; button on my Facebook page. 97% of Icelandic adults use
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook and various sites are using Facebook ranking as a measure of
</I>&gt;<i> popularity, despite it being an incredibly skewed estimate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Smari-McCarthy-a-stjornlagabing/161452417212255?ref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Smari-McCarthy-a-stjornlagabing/161452417212255?ref=ts</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Michel, could I request that you take initiative on this on the list?
</I>&gt;<i> I can provide you with background information but I do feel very awkward
</I>&gt;<i> about asking people to support me. :P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Here's some initial background [sharable]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In 1874 Iceland received its first constitution from the Danish king
</I>&gt;<i> as a result of popular demand for increased home-rule. In 1918 the
</I>&gt;<i> country became sovereign under the Danish crown, and in 1920 a new
</I>&gt;<i> constitution to this effect was enacted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In 1944, after being disconnected with Denmark for over a year,
</I>&gt;<i> Iceland proclaimed independence. A temporary constitution, mostly based
</I>&gt;<i> on the constitution of 1920, was accepted, with an article stating that
</I>&gt;<i> it should be renewed within the year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Now 66 years have passed without the constitution being reevaluated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  After the financial crash of 2008 the Icelandic people, understanding
</I>&gt;<i> the need for democratic reform as well as economic reform, started to
</I>&gt;<i> make demands for a constitutional assembly. After the government
</I>&gt;<i> collapsed in early 2009 the new government coalition of the Social
</I>&gt;<i> Democrat Party and the Left-Green Party agreed to organize a
</I>&gt;<i> constitutional assembly, although for many months this idea looked like
</I>&gt;<i> it would be buried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In late October 2009 a national assembly was held in Iceland, where
</I>&gt;<i> 1500 people were randomly selected from the census to work over the
</I>&gt;<i> course of a day to create a new set of guiding principles for Iceland.
</I>&gt;<i> In the aftermath it was decided in parliament that the popular demand
</I>&gt;<i> for a constitutional assembly was so great that the issue could no
</I>&gt;<i> longer be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  On June 25th 2010 law 90/2010 was enacted creating a mandate for
</I>&gt;<i> general elections for a constitutional assembly consisting of 25-31
</I>&gt;<i> nonpartisan individuals, based on single transferable vote in addition
</I>&gt;<i> to a gender quota rule. The elections for this assembly are to be held
</I>&gt;<i> on November 27th 2010, 10 days from now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The electorate is the roughly 228000 voters in Iceland, and there are
</I>&gt;<i> 523 individual candidates running in the election, all as individuals
</I>&gt;<i> although some have known connections with special interest groups,
</I>&gt;<i> political parties, and such. These relationships have been mapped by
</I>&gt;<i> various websites. Various other websites provide filtering mechanisms of
</I>&gt;<i> various sorts in order to help people weed out the best 25 candidates to
</I>&gt;<i> vote for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  After the elections the assembly will convene in February 2011 and
</I>&gt;<i> operate for 2-4 months during that year to draft a new constitution and
</I>&gt;<i> propose it to parliament, along with suggested adoption mechanisms and
</I>&gt;<i> protocols. If parliament accepts the new constitution it will be put to
</I>&gt;<i> a referendum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  There has been an alarming amount of P2P activity in relation to this
</I>&gt;<i> election. Campaigns are primarily being operated through social
</I>&gt;<i> networking sites, with a lot of pressure on candidates not to advertise
</I>&gt;<i> in traditional media. A lot of individuals and organizations have been
</I>&gt;<i> in direct contact with the various candidates in order to provide their
</I>&gt;<i> own arbitrary filters, and in general there is a lot of buzz, but also a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of uncertainty, as the number of candidates and the equidistribution
</I>&gt;<i> of the attention is the source of great confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  To reduce this confusion somewhat and to promote the elections as an
</I>&gt;<i> important step towards more direct democracy, a broad coalition of
</I>&gt;<i> candidates from various political leanings has joined forces to raise
</I>&gt;<i> awareness about the forthcoming elections, operating on amicable
</I>&gt;<i> grounds, and further, there are discussions about creating a &quot;shadow
</I>&gt;<i> assembly&quot; using the Shadow Parliament Project's software and
</I>&gt;<i> organizational mechanisms, in order to facilitate broad discussions
</I>&gt;<i> amongst the general public during the operation time of the assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In short, it looks like the opportunity for Iceland is great, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are still a number of hurdles. It will be interesting to see the
</I>&gt;<i> results, and hopefully this will lead to a great democratic upheaval,
</I>&gt;<i> promoting and protecting networked societies in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Hope you can use some of that in some meaningful way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Sm&#225;ri
