<PRE>But destroying natural resources such as water supplies is *good* for the
economy because Scarcity increases Profit, and what could we ever possibly
pay Investors if not Profit?

We can't pay Investors with Product unless those Investors are also
Consumers - for who else would accept such a strange ROI?

</I>&gt;<i>   We are Facing the Greatest Threat to Humanity: Only Fundamental Change
</I>&gt;<i> Can Save Us

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.alternet.org/story/148519/">http://www.alternet.org/story/148519/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Maude Barlow gave this stirring plenary speech, full of hope even in the
</I>&gt;<i> face of ecological disasters, to the Environmental Grantmakers Association
</I>&gt;<i> annual retreat in Pacific Grove, California. Barlow, a former UN Senior
</I>&gt;<i> Water Advisor, is National Chairperson of the **Council of Canadians** and
</I>&gt;<i> founder of the Blue Planet Project. Barlow is a contributor to AlterNet's
</I>&gt;<i> forth-coming book* Water Matters: Why We Need to Act Now to Save Our Most
</I>&gt;<i> Critical Resource.**
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We all know that the earth and all upon it face a growing crisis. Global
</I>&gt;<i> climate change is rapidly advancing, melting glaciers, eroding soil, causing
</I>&gt;<i> freak and increasingly wild storms, and displacing untold millions from
</I>&gt;<i> rural communities to live in desperate poverty in peri-urban slums. Almost
</I>&gt;<i> every human victim lives in the global South, in communities not responsible
</I>&gt;<i> for greenhouse gas emissions. The atmosphere has already warmed up almost a
</I>&gt;<i> full degree in the last several decades and a new Canadian study reports
</I>&gt;<i> that we may be on course to add another 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees
</I>&gt;<i> Fahrenheit) by 2100.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Half the tropical forests in the world &#8211; the lungs of our ecosystems &#8211; are
</I>&gt;<i> gone; by 2030, at the current rate of harvest, only 10% will be left
</I>&gt;<i> standing. Ninety percent of the big fish in the sea are gone, victim to
</I>&gt;<i> wanton predatory fishing practices. Says a prominent scientist studying
</I>&gt;<i> their demise &#8220;there is no blue frontier left.&#8221; Half the world&#8217;s wetlands &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> the kidneys of our ecosystems &#8211; were destroyed in the 20th century. Species
</I>&gt;<i> extinction is taking place at a rate one thousand times greater than before
</I>&gt;<i> humans existed. According to a Smithsonian scientist, we are headed toward a
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;biodiversity deficit&#8221; in which species and ecosystems will be destroyed at
</I>&gt;<i> a rate faster than Nature can create new ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are polluting our lakes, rivers and streams to death. Every day, 2
</I>&gt;<i> million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged
</I>&gt;<i> into the world&#8217;s water, the equivalent of the weight of the entire human
</I>&gt;<i> population of 6.8 billion people. The amount of wastewater produced annually
</I>&gt;<i> is about six times more water than exists in all the rivers of the world. A
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive new global study recently reported that 80% of the world&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> rivers are now in peril, affecting 5 billion people on the planet. We are
</I>&gt;<i> also mining our groundwater far faster than nature can replenish it, sucking
</I>&gt;<i> it up to grow water-guzzling chemical-fed crops in deserts or to water
</I>&gt;<i> thirsty cities that dump an astounding 200 trillion gallons of land-based
</I>&gt;<i> water as waste in the oceans every year. The global mining industry sucks up
</I>&gt;<i> another 200 trillion gallons, which it leaves behind as poison. Fully one
</I>&gt;<i> third of global water withdrawals are now used to produce biofuels, enough
</I>&gt;<i> water to feed the world. A recent global survey of groundwater found that
</I>&gt;<i> the rate of depletion more than doubled in the last half century. If water
</I>&gt;<i> was drained as rapidly from the Great Lakes, they would be bone dry in
</I>&gt;<i> 80 years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The global water crisis is the greatest ecological and human threat
</I>&gt;<i> humanity has ever faced. As vast areas of the planet are becoming desert as
</I>&gt;<i> we suck the remaining waters out of living ecosystems and drain remaining
</I>&gt;<i> aquifers in India, China, Australia, most of Africa, all of the Middle East,
</I>&gt;<i> Mexico, Southern Europe, US Southwest and other places. Dirty water is the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest killer of children; every day more children die of water borne
</I>&gt;<i> disease than HIV/AIDS, malaria and war together. In the global South, dirty
</I>&gt;<i> water kills a child every three and a half seconds. And it is getting worse,
</I>&gt;<i> fast. By 2030, global demand for water will exceed supply by 40%&#8212; an
</I>&gt;<i> astounding figure foretelling of terrible suffering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing there will not be enough food and water for all in the near future,
</I>&gt;<i> wealthy countries and global investment, pension and hedge funds are buying
</I>&gt;<i> up land and water, fields and forests in the global South, creating a new
</I>&gt;<i> wave of invasive colonialism that will have huge geo-political
</I>&gt;<i> ramifications. Rich investors have already bought up an amount of land
</I>&gt;<i> double the size of the United Kingdom in Africa alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *We Simply Cannot Continue on the Present Path*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think it possible to exaggerate the threat to our earth and every
</I>&gt;<i> living thing upon it. Quite simply we cannot continue on the path that
</I>&gt;<i> brought us here. Einstein said that problems cannot be solved by the same
</I>&gt;<i> level of thinking that created them. While mouthing platitudes about caring
</I>&gt;<i> for the earth, most of our governments are deepening the crisis with new
</I>&gt;<i> plans for expanded resource exploitation, unregulated free trade deals, more
</I>&gt;<i> invasive investment, the privatization of absolutely everything and
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited growth. This model of development is literally killing the planet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unlimited growth assumes unlimited resources, and this is the genesis of
</I>&gt;<i> the crisis. Quite simply, to feed the increasing demands of our consumer
</I>&gt;<i> based system, humans have seen nature as a great resource for our personal
</I>&gt;<i> convenience and profit, not as a living ecosystem from which all life
</I>&gt;<i> springs. So we have built our economic and development policies based on a
</I>&gt;<i> human-centric model and assumed either that nature would never fail to
</I>&gt;<i> provide or that, where it does fail, technology will save the day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Two Problems that Hinder the Environmental Movement*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the perspective of the environmental movement, I see two problems that
</I>&gt;<i> hinder us in our work to stop this carnage. The first is that, with notable
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions, most environmental groups either have bought into the dominant
</I>&gt;<i> model of development or feel incapable of changing it. The main form of
</I>&gt;<i> environmental protection in industrialized countries is based on the
</I>&gt;<i> regulatory system, legalizing the discharge of large amounts of toxics into
</I>&gt;<i> the environment. Environmentalists work to minimize the damage from these
</I>&gt;<i> systems, essentially fighting for inadequate laws based on curbing the worst
</I>&gt;<i> practices, but leaving intact the system of economic globalization at the
</I>&gt;<i> heart of the problem. Trapped inside this paradigm, many environmentalists
</I>&gt;<i> essentially prop up a deeply flawed system, not imagining they are capable
</I>&gt;<i> of creating another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, the support of false solutions such as carbon markets, which, in
</I>&gt;<i> effect, privatize the atmosphere by creating a new form of property rights
</I>&gt;<i> over natural resources. Carbon markets are predicated less on reducing
</I>&gt;<i> emissions than on the desire to make carbon cuts as cheap as possible for
</I>&gt;<i> large corporations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another false solution is the move to turn water into private property,
</I>&gt;<i> which can then be hoarded, bought and sold on the open market. The latest
</I>&gt;<i> proposals are for a water pollution market, similar to carbon markets, where
</I>&gt;<i> companies and countries will buy and sell the right to pollute water. With
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of privatization comes a loss of public oversight to manage and
</I>&gt;<i> protect watersheds. Commodifying water renders an earth-centred vision for
</I>&gt;<i> watersheds and ecosystems unattainable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is PES, or Payment for Ecological Services, which puts a price
</I>&gt;<i> tag on ecological goods &#8211; clean air, water, soil etc, &#8211; and the services
</I>&gt;<i> such as water purification, crop pollination and carbon sequestration that
</I>&gt;<i> sustain them. A market model of PES is an agreement between the &#8220;holder&#8221; and
</I>&gt;<i> the &#8220;consumer&#8221; of an ecosystem service, turning that service into an
</I>&gt;<i> environmental property right. Clearly this system privatizes nature, be it a
</I>&gt;<i> wetland, lake, forest plot or mountain, and sets the stage for private
</I>&gt;<i> accumulation of nature by those wealthy enough to be able to buy, hoard sell
</I>&gt;<i> and trade it. Already, northern hemisphere governments and private
</I>&gt;<i> corporations are studying public/private/partnerships to set up lucrative
</I>&gt;<i> PES projects in the global South. Says Friends of the Earth International,
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Governments need to acknowledge that market-based mechanisms and the
</I>&gt;<i> commodification of biodiversity have failed both biodiversity conservation
</I>&gt;<i> and poverty alleviation.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second problem with our movement is one of silos. For too long
</I>&gt;<i> environmentalists have toiled in isolation from those communities and groups
</I>&gt;<i> working for human and social justice and for fundamental change to the
</I>&gt;<i> system. On one hand are the scientists, scholars, and environmentalists
</I>&gt;<i> warning of a looming ecological crisis and monitoring the decline of the
</I>&gt;<i> world&#8217;s freshwater stocks, energy sources and biodiversity. On the other are
</I>&gt;<i> the development experts, anti-poverty advocates, and NGOs working to address
</I>&gt;<i> the inequitable access to food, water and health care and campaigning for
</I>&gt;<i> these services, particularly in the global South. The assumption is that
</I>&gt;<i> these are two different sets of problems, one needing a scientific and
</I>&gt;<i> ecological solution, the other needing a financial solution based on pulling
</I>&gt;<i> money from wealthy countries, institutions and organizations to find new
</I>&gt;<i> resources for the poor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The clearest example I have is in the area I know best, the freshwater
</I>&gt;<i> crisis. It is finally becoming clear to even the most intransigent silo
</I>&gt;<i> separatists that the ecological and human water crises are intricately
</I>&gt;<i> linked, and that to deal effectively with either means dealing with both.
</I>&gt;<i> The notion that inequitable access can be dealt with by finding more money
</I>&gt;<i> to pump more groundwater is based on a misunderstanding that assumes
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited supply, when in fact humans everywhere are overpumping groundwater
</I>&gt;<i> supplies. Similarly, the hope that communities will cooperate in the
</I>&gt;<i> restoration of their water systems when they are desperately poor and have
</I>&gt;<i> no way of conserving or cleaning the limited sources they use is a cruel
</I>&gt;<i> fantasy. The ecological health of the planet is intricately tied to the need
</I>&gt;<i> for a just system of water distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The global water justice movement (of which I have the honour of being
</I>&gt;<i> deeply involved) is, I believe, successfully incorporating concerns about
</I>&gt;<i> the growing ecological water crisis with the promotion of just economic,
</I>&gt;<i> food and trade policies to ensure water for all. We strongly believe that
</I>&gt;<i> fighting for equitable water in a world running out means taking better care
</I>&gt;<i> of the water we have, not just finding supposedly endless new sources.
</I>&gt;<i> Through countless gatherings where we took the time to really hear one
</I>&gt;<i> another &#8211; especially grassroots groups and tribal peoples closest to the
</I>&gt;<i> struggle &#8211; we developed a set of guiding principles and a vision for an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative future that are universally accepted in our movement and have
</I>&gt;<i> served us well in times of stress. We are also deeply critical of the trade
</I>&gt;<i> and development policies of the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and
</I>&gt;<i> the World Water Council (whom I call the &#8220;Lords of water&#8221;), and we openly
</I>&gt;<i> challenge their model and authority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, a fresh and exciting new movement exploded onto the scene in
</I>&gt;<i> Copenhagen and set all the traditional players on their heads. The climate
</I>&gt;<i> justice movement whose motto is Change the System, Not the Climate, arrived
</I>&gt;<i> to challenge not only the stalemate of the government negotiators but the
</I>&gt;<i> stale state of too cosy alliances between major environmental groups,
</I>&gt;<i> international institutions and big business &#8211; the traditional &#8220;players&#8221; on
</I>&gt;<i> the climate scene. Those climate justice warriors went on to gather at
</I>&gt;<i> another meeting in Cochabamba, Bolivia, producing a powerful alternative
</I>&gt;<i> declaration to the weak statement that came out of Copenhagen. The new
</I>&gt;<i> document forged in Bolivia put the world on notice that business as usual is
</I>&gt;<i> not on the climate agenda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *How the Commons Fits In*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I deeply believe it is time for us to extend these powerful new movements,
</I>&gt;<i> which fuse the analysis and hard work of the environmental community with
</I>&gt;<i> the vision and commitment of the justice community, into a whole new form of
</I>&gt;<i> governance that not only challenges the current model of unlimited growth
</I>&gt;<i> and economic globalization but promotes an alternative that will allow us
</I>&gt;<i> and the Earth to survive. Quite simply, human-centred governance systems are
</I>&gt;<i> not working and we need new economic, development, and environmental
</I>&gt;<i> policies as well as new laws that articulate an entirely different point of
</I>&gt;<i> view from that which underpins most governance systems today. At the centre
</I>&gt;<i> of this new paradigm is the need to protect natural ecosystems and to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> the equitable and just sharing of their bounty. It also means the recovery
</I>&gt;<i> of an old concept called the Commons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Commons is based on the notion that just by being members of the human
</I>&gt;<i> family, we all have rights to certain common heritages, be they the
</I>&gt;<i> atmosphere and oceans, freshwater and genetic diversity, or culture,
</I>&gt;<i> language and wisdom. In most traditional societies, it was assumed that what
</I>&gt;<i> belonged to one belonged to all. Many indigenous societies to this day
</I>&gt;<i> cannot conceive of denying a person or a family basic access to food, air,
</I>&gt;<i> land, water and livelihood. Many modern societies extended the same concept
</I>&gt;<i> of universal access to the notion of a social Commons, creating education,
</I>&gt;<i> health care and social security for all members of the community. Since
</I>&gt;<i> adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, governments are
</I>&gt;<i> obliged to protect the human rights, cultural diversity and food security of
</I>&gt;<i> their citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A central characteristic of the Commons is the need for careful
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative management of shared resources by those who use them and
</I>&gt;<i> allocation of access based on a set of priorities. A Commons is not a
</I>&gt;<i> free-for-all. We are not talking about a return to the notion that nature&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> capacity to sustain our ways is unlimited and anyone can use whatever they
</I>&gt;<i> want, however they want, whenever they want. It is rooted rather in a sober
</I>&gt;<i> and realistic assessment of the true damage that has already been unleashed
</I>&gt;<i> on the world&#8217;s biological heritage as well as the knowledge that our
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystems must be managed and shared in a way that protects them now and
</I>&gt;<i> for all time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also to be recovered and expanded is the notion of the Public Trust
</I>&gt;<i> Doctrine, a longstanding legal principle which holds that certain natural
</I>&gt;<i> resources, particularly air, water and the oceans, are central to our very
</I>&gt;<i> existence and therefore must be protected for the common good and not
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to be appropriated for private gain. Under the Public Trust
</I>&gt;<i> Doctrine, governments exercise their fiduciary responsibilities to sustain
</I>&gt;<i> the essence of these resources for the long-term use and enjoyment of the
</I>&gt;<i> entire populace, not just the privileged who can buy inequitable access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Public Trust Doctrine was first codified in 529 A.D. by Emperor
</I>&gt;<i> Justinius who declared: &#8220;By the laws of nature, these things are common to
</I>&gt;<i> all mankind: the air, running water, the sea and consequently the shores of
</I>&gt;<i> the sea.&#8221; U.S. courts have referred to the Public Trust Doctrine as a &#8220;high,
</I>&gt;<i> solemn and perpetual duty&#8221; and held that the states hold title to the lands
</I>&gt;<i> under navigable waters &#8220;in trust for the people of the State.&#8221; Recently,
</I>&gt;<i> Vermont used the Public Trust Doctrine to protect its groundwater from
</I>&gt;<i> rampant exploitation, declaring that no one owns this resource but rather,
</I>&gt;<i> it belongs to the people of Vermont and future generations. The new law also
</I>&gt;<i> places a priority for this water in times of shortages: water for daily
</I>&gt;<i> human use, sustainable food production and ecosystem protection takes
</I>&gt;<i> precedence over water for industrial and commercial use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An exciting new network of Canadian, American and First Nations communities
</I>&gt;<i> around the Great Lakes is determined to have these lakes names a Commons, a
</I>&gt;<i> public trust and a protected bioregion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equitable access to natural resources is another key character of the
</I>&gt;<i> Commons. These resources are not there for the taking by private interests
</I>&gt;<i> who can then deny them to anyone without means. The human right to land,
</I>&gt;<i> food, water, health care and biodiversity are being codified as we speak
</I>&gt;<i> from nation-state constitutions to the United Nations. Ellen Dorsey and
</I>&gt;<i> colleagues have recently called for a human rights approach to development,
</I>&gt;<i> where the most vulnerable and marginalized communities take priority in law
</I>&gt;<i> and practice. They suggest renaming the United Nation&#8217;s Millennium
</I>&gt;<i> Development Goals the Millennium Development Rights and putting the voices
</I>&gt;<i> of the poor at the centre.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would require the meaningful involvement of those affected
</I>&gt;<i> communities, especially Indigenous groups, in designing and implementing
</I>&gt;<i> development strategies. Community-based governance is another basic tenet of
</I>&gt;<i> the Commons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Inspiring Successes Around the Globe*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another crucial tenet of the new paradigm is the need to put the natural
</I>&gt;<i> world back into the centre of our existence. If we listen, nature will teach
</I>&gt;<i> us how to live. Again, using the issue I know best, we know exactly what to
</I>&gt;<i> do to create a secure water future: protection and restoration of
</I>&gt;<i> watersheds; conservation; source protection; rainwater and storm water
</I>&gt;<i> harvesting; local, sustainable food production; and meaningful laws to halt
</I>&gt;<i> pollution. Martin Luther King Jr. said legislation may not change the heart
</I>&gt;<i> but it will restrain the heartless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Life and livelihoods have been returned to communities in Rajasthan, India,
</I>&gt;<i> through a system of rainwater harvesting that has made desertified land
</I>&gt;<i> bloom and rivers run again thanks to the collective action of villagers. The
</I>&gt;<i> city of Salisbury South Australia, has become an international wonder for
</I>&gt;<i> greening desertified land in the wake of historic low flows of the Murray
</I>&gt;<i> River. It captures every drop of rain that falls from the sky and collects
</I>&gt;<i> storm and wastewater and funnels it all through a series of wetlands, which
</I>&gt;<i> clean it, to underground natural aquifers, which store it, until it
</I>&gt;<i> is needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a &#8220;debt for nature&#8221; swap, Canada, the U.S. and The Netherlands cancelled
</I>&gt;<i> the debt owed to them by Colombia in exchange for the money being used for
</I>&gt;<i> watershed restoration. The most exciting project is the restoration of 16
</I>&gt;<i> large wetland areas of the Bogot&#225; River, which is badly contaminated, to
</I>&gt;<i> pristine condition. Eventually the plan is to clean up the entire river.
</I>&gt;<i> True to principles of the Commons, the indigenous peoples living on the
</I>&gt;<i> sites were not removed, but rather, have become caretakers of these
</I>&gt;<i> protected and sacred places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The natural world also needs its own legal framework, what South African
</I>&gt;<i> environmental lawyer Cormac Culllinen calls &#8220;wild law.&#8221; The quest is a body
</I>&gt;<i> of law that recognizes the inherent rights of the environment, other species
</I>&gt;<i> and water itself outside of their usefulness to humans. A wild law is a law
</I>&gt;<i> to regulate human behaviour in order to protect the integrity of the earth
</I>&gt;<i> and all species on it. It requires a change in the human relationship with
</I>&gt;<i> the natural world from one of exploitation to one of democracy with other
</I>&gt;<i> beings. If we are members of the earth&#8217;s community, then our rights must be
</I>&gt;<i> balanced against those of plants, animals, rivers and ecosystems. In a world
</I>&gt;<i> governed by wild law, the destructive, human-centred exploitation of the
</I>&gt;<i> natural world would be unlawful. Humans would be prohibited from
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately destroying functioning ecosystems or driving other species
</I>&gt;<i> to extinction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This kind of legal framework is already being established. The Indian
</I>&gt;<i> Supreme Court has ruled that protection of natural lakes and ponds is akin
</I>&gt;<i> to honouring the right to life &#8211; the most fundamental right of all according
</I>&gt;<i> to the Court. Wild law was the inspiration behind an ordinance in Tamaqua
</I>&gt;<i> Borough, Pennsylvania that recognized natural ecosystems and natural
</I>&gt;<i> communities within the borough as &#8220;legal persons&#8221; for the purposes of
</I>&gt;<i> stopping the dumping of sewage sludge on wild land. It has been used
</I>&gt;<i> throughout New England in a series of local ordinances to prevent bottled
</I>&gt;<i> water companies from setting up shop in the area. Residents of Mount Shasta
</I>&gt;<i> California have put a wild law ordinance on the November 2010 ballot to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent cloud seeding and bulk water extraction within city limits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 2008, Ecuador&#8217;s citizens voted two thirds in support of a new
</I>&gt;<i> constitution, which says, &#8220;Natural communities and ecosystems possess the
</I>&gt;<i> unalienable right to exist, flourish and evolve within Ecuador. Those rights
</I>&gt;<i> shall be self-executing, and it shall be the duty and right of all
</I>&gt;<i> Ecuadorian governments, communities, and individuals to enforce those
</I>&gt;<i> rights.&#8221; Bolivia has recently amended its constitution to enshrine the
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy of &#8220;living well&#8221; as a means of expressing concern with the
</I>&gt;<i> current model of development and signifying affinity with nature and the
</I>&gt;<i> need for humans to recognize inherent rights of the earth and other living
</I>&gt;<i> beings. The government of Argentina recently moved to protect its glaciers
</I>&gt;<i> by banning mining and oil drilling in ice zones. The law sets standards for
</I>&gt;<i> protecting glaciers and surrounding ecosystems and creates penalties just
</I>&gt;<i> for harming the country&#8217;s fresh water heritage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most far-reaching proposal for the protection of nature itself is the
</I>&gt;<i> Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth that was drafted at the
</I>&gt;<i> April 2010 World People&#8217;s Conference on Climate Change in Cochabamba,
</I>&gt;<i> Bolivia and endorsed by the 35,000 participants there. We are writing a book
</I>&gt;<i> setting out our case for this Declaration to the United Nations and the
</I>&gt;<i> world. The intent is for it to become a companion document to the 1948
</I>&gt;<i> Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Every now and then in history, the
</I>&gt;<i> human race takes a collective step forward in its evolution. Such a time is
</I>&gt;<i> upon us now as we begin to understand the urgent need to protect the earth
</I>&gt;<i> and its ecosystems from which all life comes. The Universal Declaration on
</I>&gt;<i> the Rights of Mother Earth must become a history-altering covenant toward a
</I>&gt;<i> just and sustainable future for all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What Can We Do Right Now?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What might this mean for funders and other who share these values? Well,
</I>&gt;<i> let me be clear: the hard work of those fighting environmental destruction
</I>&gt;<i> and injustice must continue. I am not suggesting for one moment that his
</I>&gt;<i> work is not important or that the funding for this work is not needed. I do
</I>&gt;<i> think however, that there are ways to move the agenda I have outlined here
</I>&gt;<i> forward if we put our minds to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anything that helps bridge the solitudes and silos is pure gold. Bringing
</I>&gt;<i> together environmentalists and justice activists to understand one another&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> work and perspective is crucial. Both sides have to dream into being &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> together &#8211; the world they know is possible and not settle for small
</I>&gt;<i> improvements to the one we have. This means working for a whole different
</I>&gt;<i> economic, trade and development model even while fighting the abuses
</I>&gt;<i> existing in the current one. Given a choice between funding an environmental
</I>&gt;<i> organization that basically supports the status quo with minor changes and
</I>&gt;<i> one that promotes a justice agenda as well, I would argue for the latter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Support that increases capacity at the base is also very important, as is
</I>&gt;<i> funding that connects domestic to international struggle, always related
</I>&gt;<i> even when not apparent. Funding for those projects and groups fighting to
</I>&gt;<i> abolish or fundamentally change global trade and banking institutions that
</I>&gt;<i> maintain corporate dominance and promote unlimited and unregulated growth is
</I>&gt;<i> still essential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *How Clean Water Became a Human Right*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We all, as well, have to find ways to thank and protect those groups and
</I>&gt;<i> governments going out on a limb to promote an agenda for true change. A very
</I>&gt;<i> good example is President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who brought the climate
</I>&gt;<i> justice movement together in Cochabamba last April and is leading the
</I>&gt;<i> campaign at the UN to promote the Rights of Mother Earth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was this small, poor, largely indigenous landlocked country, and its
</I>&gt;<i> former coca-farmer president, that introduced a resolution to recognize the
</I>&gt;<i> human right to water and sanitation this past June to the UN General
</I>&gt;<i> Assembly, taking the whole UN community by surprise. The Bolivian UN
</I>&gt;<i> Ambassador, Pablo Solon, decided he was fed up with the &#8220;commissions&#8221; and
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;further studies&#8221; and &#8220;expert consultations&#8221; that have managed to put off
</I>&gt;<i> the question of the right to water for at least a decade at the UN and that
</I>&gt;<i> it was time to put an &#8220;up or down&#8221; question to every country: do you or do
</I>&gt;<i> you not support the human right to drinking water and sanitation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A mad scramble ensued as a group of Anglo-Western countries, all promoting
</I>&gt;<i> to some extent the notion of water as a private commodity, tried to derail
</I>&gt;<i> the process and put off the vote. The U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia and
</I>&gt;<i> New Zealand even cooked up a &#8220;consensus&#8221; resolution that was so bland
</I>&gt;<i> everyone would likely have handily voted for it at an earlier date. But
</I>&gt;<i> sitting beside the real thing, it looked like what it was &#8211; an attempt, yet
</I>&gt;<i> again, to put off any meaningful commitment at the UN to the billions
</I>&gt;<i> suffering from lack of clean water. When that didn&#8217;t work, they toiled
</I>&gt;<i> behind the scenes to weaken the wording of the Bolivian resolution but to no
</I>&gt;<i> avail. On July 28, 2010, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to
</I>&gt;<i> adopt a resolution recognizing the human right to water and sanitation. One
</I>&gt;<i> hundred and twenty two countries voted for the resolution; 41 abstained; not
</I>&gt;<i> one had the courage to vote against.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I share this story with you not only because my team and I were deeply
</I>&gt;<i> involved in the lead up to this historic vote and there for it the day it
</I>&gt;<i> was presented, but because it was the culmination of work done by a movement
</I>&gt;<i> operating on the principles I have outlined above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We took the time to establish the common principles that water is a Commons
</I>&gt;<i> that belongs to the earth, all species, and the future, and is a fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> human right not to be appropriated for profit. We advocate for the Public
</I>&gt;<i> Trust Doctrine in law at every level of government. We set out to build a
</I>&gt;<i> movement that listens first and most to the poorest among us, especially
</I>&gt;<i> indigenous and tribal voices. We work with communities and groups in other
</I>&gt;<i> movements, especially those working on climate justice and trade justice. We
</I>&gt;<i> understand the need for careful collaborative cooperation to restore the
</I>&gt;<i> functioning of watersheds and we have come to revere the water that gives
</I>&gt;<i> life to all things upon the Earth. While we clearly have much left to do,
</I>&gt;<i> these water warriors inspire me and give me hope. They get me out of bed
</I>&gt;<i> every morning to fight another day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe I am in a room full of stewards and want, then to leave you with
</I>&gt;<i> these words from *Lord of the Rings*. This is Gandalf speaking the night
</I>&gt;<i> before he faces a terrible force that threatens all living beings. His words
</I>&gt;<i> are for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The rule of no realm is mine, but all worthy things that are in peril, as
</I>&gt;<i> the world now stand, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly
</I>&gt;<i> fail in my task if anything passes through this night that can still grow
</I>&gt;<i> fair, or bear fruit, and flower again in the days to come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For I too am a steward, did you not know?&#8221; &#8212;J.R.R. Tolkien
