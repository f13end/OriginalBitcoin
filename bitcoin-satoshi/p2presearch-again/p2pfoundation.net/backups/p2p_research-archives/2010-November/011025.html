FLEEING VESUVIUS
*Table of contents*

  *Preface &lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/preface.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/preface.php</A>&gt; - Eamon
Ryan*
*Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Ireland*

*Introduction &lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/intro.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/intro.php</A>&gt; - Richard
Douthwaite *
*The people who began using fossil fuels to increase their productivity 300
years ago set the world on its path to the present crisis.*

*About the contributors &lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/bios.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/bios.php</A>&gt;*

Part 1: Energy availability

*David Korowicz - On the cusp of collapse: complexity, energy and the
globalised economy *
*If less energy is available in future, our economic system will not
contract in a gentle, controllable manner. Instead it is likely to collapse.
*

*Chris Vernon - Future energy availability: the importance of 'net energy' *
*Although there is a lot of oil still left in the ground, its supply will
contract very rapidly indeed and the world may have run out of oil to burn
for energy by 2050.*

*Tom Konrad - Calculating EIRR, the Energy Internal Rate of Return *
*If a standard assessment tool, the internal rate of return, is used to
compare the net energy yield of various projects, it shows which to
prioritise for the energy transition.*

*Nate Hagens and Kenneth Mulder - Energy and water: the real blue-chips *
*The world needs to abandon money as its measure if it is to invest its
scarcest, most limiting resources in the best possible way.*

*Part 2: Innovation in business, money and finance*

*Richard Douthwaite - The supply of money in an energy-scarce world*
*If less energy is available in future the existing stock of money can
either lose its value gradually through inflation or suddenly because of the
collapse of the banking system that created it.*

*Graham Barnes - Liquidity Networks: a debt-free electronic currency system
for communities *
*No currency will work unless people accept it from each other so this novel
form of money will be put into circulation by being given to those who are
accepting and spending it most.*

*Chris Cook - Equity partnerships: a better, fairer approach to developing
land *
*A new way of organising developments promises better buildings, more
affordable rents and a stake in the outcome for everyone.*

*James Pike - Using equity partnerships to rescue building projects hit by
the downturn *
*Community land partnerships provide an alternative way of becoming a
property owner and gaining a voice in the management of the development in
which one lives.*

*Tim Helweg-Larsen - Trying to form an equity partnership to buy a Welsh
farm *
*Because there isn't a market yet for shares in an equity partnership, it
proved hard to convince would-be investors that someone would pay a fair
price for their holding when they wanted to move on.*

*Oscar Kjellberg - The Mondragon bank: an old model for a new type of
finance *
*A new type of institution is needed to handle non-debt finance. It should
help promoters plan their projects and then find outside investor-partners
in return for a share of each project's income.*

*Patrick Andrews - Re-thinking business structures: how to encourage
sustainability through conscious design choices *
*Business could be the most powerful force in the world in achieving higher
levels of sustainability and resilience but its potential is blocked and
shareholders' interests are put before those of society and the planet.*

*Dan Sullivan - Why Pittsburgh real estate never crashes: the progressive
reform that stabilised an economy *
*Site value taxation is the reason why Pittsburgh's foreclosure rates are
low despite the downturn, its home prices are climbing slightly and
construction rates are increasing.*

*Dmitry Orlov - Definancialisation, deglobalisation and relocalisation *
*Attempts at recovery will fail. Anyone who recognises this should spend
whatever money they have engaging with their neighbours and the land.*

Part 3: New ways of using the land

*Emer O'Siochru - Cutting transport costs and emissions though local
integration *
*Rather than bringing similar activities closer together to reap the
benefits of scale and agglomeration, different activities should be situated
beside each other to be more energy and carbon efficient.*

*Bruce Darrell - The nutritional resilience approach to food security *
*Very few soils have a perfect balance of minerals. If the option of filling
one's plate from all over the world disappears, human health will likely
decline unless the missing minerals are applied to the soil while it is
still possible to do so.*

*Corinna Byrne - Refocusing the purpose of the land: from emissions source
to carbon sink *
*Ireland needs to implement new policies in order to get its land to absorb
CO2 rather than release it. Biochar could reduce nitrous oxide and methane
emissions and build up the fertility and carbon content of the soil.*

Part 4: Dealing with climate change

*Alex Evans - Future global climate institutions *
*Any framework for dealing with the climate crisis should distribute the
global carbon budget among the world's nations according to a transparent,
equitable formula. To achieve this, global climate institutions will have to
change.*

*Laurence Matthews - Cap and Share: Simple is Beautiful *
*Cap &amp; Share is a fair, effective, cheap, empowering and simple way to
reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. It could form the basis
of a wider global climate framework but how realistic is it to call for its
introduction?*

*Julian Darley - Influencing high-level, strategic decision-making towards a
sustainable, low-carbon economy *
*Decision-making at a global level is governed by a number of non-economic
factors which need to be taken into account if the new systems required to
deal effectively with climate change are to be introduced.*

Part 5: Changing the way we live

*Brian Davey - Danger ahead: prioritising risk avoidance in political and
economic decision-making *
*Now that the financial and political parts of the present system have
largely discredited themselves, a fluid situation exists that might allow
more viable options to emerge.*

*Davie Philip - Transition thinking: The Good Life 2.0 *
*We need to make an evolutionary leap in the way we do things if we are to
make a controlled, planned transition to a post-industrial, low-carbon
society. The Transition Towns movement provides a potential model.*

*Dmitry Orlov - Sailing craft for a post-collapse world *
*Land transport will be costly, difficult and dangerous after the industrial
system has broken down. Moving goods and people by water will be a better
option even for quite short distances.*

Part 6: Changing the way we think

*Nate Hagens - The psychological roots of resource over-consumption*
*Humans have an innate need for status and for novelty in their lives.
Unfortunately, the modern world has adopted very energy- and
resource-intensive ways of meeting those needs.*

*Mark Rutledge and Brian Davey - Seven reasons for humanity's inertia in the
face of disaster and how they can be overcome *
*Why have humans failed to curb their excessive resource consumption? Seven
reasons are outlined here, some of which are systemic, others the result of
the way humanity evolved.*

*John Sharry - Cultivating hope and managing despair *
*Modern psychological models of motivation and change suggest strategies
that can be used to help individuals come to terms with the nature and
extent of the changes facing them.*

*Lucy McAndrew - Collapse or no collapse: we need to respect to survive *
*Respect for ourselves, for others and for nature is fundamental to survival
because it is what gives us a sense of our place in the world and, when we
lose that, we float free of the network of relationships that sustains us.*

*Anne Ryan - Enough: a worldview for positive futures *
*There is a crucial need for a new, self-limiting worldview which recognises
that &quot;enough is plenty&quot;. Adopting such a worldview would nourish a culture
in which social justice could prevail.*

Part 7: Ideas for action

*Fleeing Vesuvius: the emergency plan *
*Compiled by Caroline Whyte
Contributors to this book suggest steps they think should be taken to escape
disaster in four areas - in one's family, in one's community, in one's
country, and in the world.*

*Fleeing Vesuvius*

Dear Feasta News subscribers and friends,

Feasta is launching its new book, *Fleeing Vesuvius: Overcoming the risks of
economic and environmental
collapse&lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/index.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/index.php</A>&gt;
*, on Saturday, November 20th, in Dublin. Our most important book to date,
it draws together many of the ideas our members have developed over the
years and applies them to a single question - how can we bring the world out
of the mess in which it finds itself?

*Fleeing Vesuvius* confronts this mess squarely, analysing its many aspects:
the looming scarcity of essential resources such as fossil fuels - the
lifeblood of the world economy; the financial crisis in Ireland and
elsewhere; the collapse of the housing bubble; the urgent need for food
security; and the enormous challenge of dealing with climate change.

The solutions it puts forward involve changes to our economy and financial
system, but they go much further: this substantial, wide-ranging book also
looks at the changes needed in how we think, how we use the land and how we
relate to others, particularly those where we live.

While it doesn't discount the complexity of the problems we face, *Fleeing
Vesuvius* is practical and fundamentally optimistic. It will arm readers
with the confidence and knowledge they need to develop new, workable
alternatives to the old-style expanding economy and its supporting systems.
It's a book that can be read all the way through or used as a resource to
dip in and out of.

You can find out about the book's 27 authors
here&lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/bios.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/bios.php</A>&gt;.
The table of contents&lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/contents.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/contents.php</A>&gt;includes
summaries of each article, and you can also read the
preface &lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/preface.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/preface.php</A>&gt; by Eamon
Ryan, the Irish Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources,
and the introduction &lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/intro.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/intro.php</A>&gt; by
Richard Douthwaite.

If you would like to get your hands on a copy of *Fleeing Vesuvius* before
the launch, you have the opportunity to order it online. From now til
November 11th you can order directly from us (with free p+p within Ireland
or a 3 euro discount on p+p outside Ireland.)

You can pay via PayPal on the Feasta
website&lt;<A HREF="http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/order.php">http://www.feasta.org/documents/vesuvius/order.php</A>&gt;.
If you live in Ireland and would prefer to pay by cheque, send your address
and a cheque/PO/bank draft (payable to Feasta) for &#8364;20 per copy to the
address below.

Of course it may suit you better to buy copies in person at the launch on
November 20th (details of this will follow shortly). If you live in the
United States or Canada, you'll be interested to know that New Society
Publishers has just bought the North American publishing rights and are
rushing to get the book into shops there before Christmas.

We are very excited about this book. We hope that you will be excited about
it too.
