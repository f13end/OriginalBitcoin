</I>&gt;<i> NEW FACES OF POVERTY - DEBT AS A SOCIOLOGICAL CATEGORY
</I>&gt;<i> by Piotr Kowzan

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/6725/1/41-48_PiotrKowzan_FELRADbok.pdf">http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/6725/1/41-48_PiotrKowzan_FELRADbok.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My research project was to find the meaning given to indebtedness in
</I>&gt;<i> Iceland. The project is part of my doctoral research and was conducted
</I>&gt;<i> under the supervision of Prof. Tomasz Szkudlarek and Dr. Steinunn
</I>&gt;<i> Hrafnsd&#243;ttir. It was supported by Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway
</I>&gt;<i> with a grant received from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism and the
</I>&gt;<i> European Economic Area Financial Mechanism through the Scholarship and
</I>&gt;<i> Training Fund. In Autumn 2009 and Sping 2010 I took 20 semi-structured
</I>&gt;<i> interviews with indebted people whom I met in Reykjavik: 10 of them
</I>&gt;<i> were Icelanders and 10 &#8211; immigrants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I came to Iceland in 2009, I realised that debt was not
</I>&gt;<i> considered a problem in itself, only the unpredictability of their
</I>&gt;<i> growth. Meanwhile, for many Poles the whole idea of financial debt was
</I>&gt;<i> controversial. At first, I felt somehow old-fashioned. Later, I was
</I>&gt;<i> inspired by anthropology, when I found that my research can be seen as
</I>&gt;<i> an &#224; rebours repetition of the traditional movement of scientists from
</I>&gt;<i> modern to pre-modern societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this article, I will use both examples from Iceland and from my
</I>&gt;<i> previous observations in Poland, hoping that they will also indicate
</I>&gt;<i> more general processes. I will present indebtedness in relation to
</I>&gt;<i> several divisions, institutions, social phenomena and in this way show
</I>&gt;<i> that both the amount and the quality of debt are crucial for
</I>&gt;<i> understanding peoples' reactions of opportunities and threats of the
</I>&gt;<i> contemporary world. The category of debt can be especially important
</I>&gt;<i> for the sociology of poverty, because debt can link to poverty in two
</I>&gt;<i> ways: firstly, debt can lead to poverty, and secondly, poor people can
</I>&gt;<i> incur debt in order to pay their bills or take loans to increase the
</I>&gt;<i> quality of their life. It does not mean that these two phenomena &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> debt and poverty &#8211; are identical. Nevertheless, their co-occurrence
</I>&gt;<i> and potential mutual conditioning encourage further research.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND EMANCIPATION
</I>&gt;<i> The basic reason for being in debt among my respondents in Iceland was
</I>&gt;<i> a loan taken to buy a house or a flat. The second popular reason was a
</I>&gt;<i> car loan, and then credit taken to launch one's own business (secured
</I>&gt;<i> by the mortgage). Getting educated also resulted in being indebted,
</I>&gt;<i> because of student loans. These student debts were not considered as a
</I>&gt;<i> significant burden in the monthly spending of respondents' households,
</I>&gt;<i> though the eventual date when student loans will be repaid was
</I>&gt;<i> unimaginable for everybody. In this perspective, debt can be
</I>&gt;<i> understood as a kind of shadow following active people. They chose a
</I>&gt;<i> place to live (a house), they became geographically mobile (a car),
</I>&gt;<i> they decided to educate themselves (a degree) and to run a business.
</I>&gt;<i> Their debt is the long-term consequence of purchases made on credit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two elements of the opposition credit/debt inform us about a basic
</I>&gt;<i> lack. It was the lack of resources for the subjects, which made it
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to become equal with their reference groups. They felt this
</I>&gt;<i> lack before taking the loan and when they had to pay it without
</I>&gt;<i> necessary resources. Reference groups are people one aspires to and
</I>&gt;<i> compares oneself to &#8211; for example when people from the group have
</I>&gt;<i> cars, one usually also wants to have it. At the same time, the
</I>&gt;<i> purchase can be treated as luxury for the broader public. As a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence, people who became indebted trying to get what others from
</I>&gt;<i> their reference group already have, are often blamed for their fate,
</I>&gt;<i> unless their aspiration was to lever themselves to a generally
</I>&gt;<i> accepted minimum standard, that is, to escape poverty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Debt can also be produced independently from loans; e.g. by getting
</I>&gt;<i> fines; because of unpaid housing rent; by being charged for obligatory
</I>&gt;<i> reparations of buildings; because of guaranteeing someone else's debt;
</I>&gt;<i> because of healthcare costs or by receiving an inheritance burdened
</I>&gt;<i> with debts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND SOCIAL CLASSES
</I>&gt;<i> In the contemporary world or at least within the European context, the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of money workers have does not depend only on their salary.
</I>&gt;<i> Workers are credited (Urba&#324;ski, 2007). Peter Sloterdijk (2009) claims
</I>&gt;<i> that this is the reason why tensions between capitalists and workers,
</I>&gt;<i> as they were seen by Karl Marks, can be considered minor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nowadays, it might be easier than in the 19th century to realise that
</I>&gt;<i> in order to launch a company capitalists borrow resources on financial
</I>&gt;<i> markets and because these credits must be paid together with
</I>&gt;<i> interests, the business has to generate profit to cover these
</I>&gt;<i> interests. Indebtedness is the basis for the thesis that the political
</I>&gt;<i> interests of workers and capitalists happens to be convergent, if they
</I>&gt;<i> are about limiting the power of creditors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the researcher's perspective I can say that debt is a social
</I>&gt;<i> class problem in the sense that the collected knowledge about
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms governing the lives of people who experience economic
</I>&gt;<i> violence comes mostly from representatives of the middle class. If
</I>&gt;<i> problems related to the issue of indebtedness were not touching
</I>&gt;<i> teachers, journalists, office workers, scientists etc. I would have
</I>&gt;<i> had few respondents, because the majority of people in debt seem to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid discussing financial issues, whereas those who &#8220;work with words&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> are less ashamed by their debt. It is only an observation and it is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to say if it illustrates a broader regularity. My respondents,
</I>&gt;<i> who &#8211; after Barbara Ehrenreich &#8211; could be named the &#8220;Nouveau Poor&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> (2009) were sometimes outraged because indebtedness forced them to use
</I>&gt;<i> social assistance institutions. Some said that in turn they &#8220;withdrew
</I>&gt;<i> their support for the state&#8221;, which had turned its middle class into
</I>&gt;<i> the poor, for which the institutions of help and control were
</I>&gt;<i> originally established.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND GENDER
</I>&gt;<i> One of the reasons of falling into debt is the traditional division of
</I>&gt;<i> social roles in the family, which is slightly different nowadays, but
</I>&gt;<i> still exists. It presupposes that the man is the breadwinner and the
</I>&gt;<i> woman decides how to satisfy the household's needs. Tracing stories of
</I>&gt;<i> debt, one may find that even in Icelandic society the man undertakes
</I>&gt;<i> contacting financial institutions and subsequently decides which
</I>&gt;<i> decisions need to be discussed collectively by the family. Despite the
</I>&gt;<i> traditional gender scheme being often abandoned, it is especially
</I>&gt;<i> strong among couples from different countries in which the woman is an
</I>&gt;<i> immigrant. As a result, there are cases when women get married to men
</I>&gt;<i> who present a wide variety of signs indicating a high social status
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. a house, cars, holidays abroad, consumption of luxury goods),
</I>&gt;<i> but these signs are all &#8220;on credit&#8221;. Insufficient knowledge regarding
</I>&gt;<i> rules of possession in contemporary capitalist societies leads women
</I>&gt;<i> into debt;, the existence of which they don't know about until the
</I>&gt;<i> divorce. Debts which burden people because of such a &#8220;catch&#8221;, are
</I>&gt;<i> called sexually transmitted debts (STDs), emphasising their connection
</I>&gt;<i> to diseases of this type. This term, called also Emotionally
</I>&gt;<i> Transmitted Debts (Baron, 1995), is especially popular in Australia.
</I>&gt;<i> Its definition and other causes particular to the vulnerability of
</I>&gt;<i> women to STDs are extensively described by Miranda Kaye (1997).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More complex cases of STDs come into being when migrants create
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;migrant networks&#8221; (Faist, 2000) by supporting more or less kin
</I>&gt;<i> new-comers in a new country. Sometimes, help meant that a migrant
</I>&gt;<i> family, which was well-established in Iceland (owned a house)
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed a loan for a car that a new-comer needed. Without such
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees, a person with &#8220;no history&#8221; had hardly any chance of buying
</I>&gt;<i> products, which were relatively expensive, but popular enough to be
</I>&gt;<i> seen as inevitable. However, displaying trust in people in order to
</I>&gt;<i> equip them with resources is burdened with some risk. The financial
</I>&gt;<i> crisis in Iceland induced a sudden diminishing of these support
</I>&gt;<i> networks. Debts caused by car loans (often taken in foreign
</I>&gt;<i> currencies) increased rapidly, new-comers capitulated and left the
</I>&gt;<i> island, while their debts accumulated and loaded mortgages of
</I>&gt;<i> guarantors, which threatened the financial security of the most
</I>&gt;<i> integrated immigrant families. It is worth noticing that it was not
</I>&gt;<i> only immigrants who supported new-comers. Icelanders guaranteed loans
</I>&gt;<i> to immigrants as well, but I did not come across any cases in which
</I>&gt;<i> they were hurt because of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND SUBJECTIVITY
</I>&gt;<i> It is more difficult for indebted people to say &#8220;enough&#8221; and answer a
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;hippie&#8221; call to leave the &#8220;rat race&#8221;. They will not stop working even
</I>&gt;<i> if they have all the material goods they need. The necessity to pay
</I>&gt;<i> back their debts in instalments forces them to sustain relationships,
</I>&gt;<i> which provide them with constant income. Thus, debt seems to be an
</I>&gt;<i> important part of disciplinary mechanisms in affluent societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is important to distinguish obligations to other people from debts
</I>&gt;<i> in financial institutions (called legal personalities, although they
</I>&gt;<i> are not people as such). Debts between people suggest deeper social
</I>&gt;<i> relations between the debtor and the creditor, while relations between
</I>&gt;<i> people and legal personalities are only based on law. These debts are
</I>&gt;<i> measurable and they may be collected by the use of all means
</I>&gt;<i> attributed to the power in a given society. The quality, quantity and
</I>&gt;<i> popularity of such obligations are interesting features of modern
</I>&gt;<i> societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of Poland and other so called post-communist countries,
</I>&gt;<i> where promoting individual loans as a solution for social problems is
</I>&gt;<i> a new phenomenon, the dislike for being indebted to financial
</I>&gt;<i> institutions is still strong. In Poland, the reason for that may be
</I>&gt;<i> partly attributed to a strong presumption that the long economic
</I>&gt;<i> crisis preceding the collapse of the communist regime was generated by
</I>&gt;<i> the government taking foreign loans; and to the still alive criticism
</I>&gt;<i> of &#8220;living on credit&#8221; in the 1970s. Moreover, even Polish proverbs
</I>&gt;<i> warn against borrowing money and there is a tradition of thinking that
</I>&gt;<i> one should not spend more money than one has (Kwa&#347;niewski, 2010). The
</I>&gt;<i> aversion to debt is especially visible among immigrants in Iceland,
</I>&gt;<i> when it is contrasted to the relaxed (until 2008) attitude of
</I>&gt;<i> Icelanders towards debt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The financial crisis in Iceland suddenly brought many people into
</I>&gt;<i> financial distress. What was new was the scale of the problem. There
</I>&gt;<i> are heavily indebted people in all capitalist countries, but usually
</I>&gt;<i> their problems are considered individual, not social. There are many
</I>&gt;<i> reasons for that. One of them is the process of the growing isolation
</I>&gt;<i> of indebted individuals. This process may be called the collapse of
</I>&gt;<i> subjectivity or alienation. Financial distress often turns sociable
</I>&gt;<i> people into apathetic ones, who isolate themselves from the world.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, their families may fall apart and they will lose
</I>&gt;<i> interest in their jobs, if the salary doesn't prevent their debts from
</I>&gt;<i> growing. Social workers in Iceland told me that their main challenge
</I>&gt;<i> was to persuade indebted people to be more active. Organisations,
</I>&gt;<i> which help the indebted, often face their apathy. Sometimes they need
</I>&gt;<i> to go as far as to give orders to their clients, so that they would
</I>&gt;<i> take a few simple actions and reduce their debt with the use of
</I>&gt;<i> available knowledge. Unfortunately, often only giving clients orders
</I>&gt;<i> helps to restore the debtor&#8217;s hope that escaping debt is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all indebted people go to social assistance institutions. Some
</I>&gt;<i> commit &#8220;heroic&#8221; deeds under the influence of their debts; i.e. actions
</I>&gt;<i> that exceed existing social norms. This makes it even more difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to perceive the problem of debt from more than an individual
</I>&gt;<i> perspective. One such spectacular heroic deed in Poland was an
</I>&gt;<i> indebted catholic priest robbing a bank (K&#261;cki, 2010). It was
</I>&gt;<i> controversial, because he subordinated many social norms to the
</I>&gt;<i> obligation of repaying his debts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND EDUCATION
</I>&gt;<i> Graduating from university, both in Poland and Iceland, increasingly
</I>&gt;<i> results in debt. In the global context, subsidising student loans by
</I>&gt;<i> the state was supposed to soften the consequences of fees at
</I>&gt;<i> universities worldwide. The contribution of the state to student loans
</I>&gt;<i> differs between countries (Shen &amp; Ziderman, 2008). Only some
</I>&gt;<i> countries, such as Denmark, provide students with real scholarships,
</I>&gt;<i> which are enough to survive. Fees at universities differ as well, and
</I>&gt;<i> once introduced, they tend to grow (Handley, 2010; Shepherd, 2010).
</I>&gt;<i> One of the effects of state subsidies is specifically the
</I>&gt;<i> impossibility to distinguish loans from scholarships. Eventually, even
</I>&gt;<i> people who were raised to be cautious with borrowing money decide to
</I>&gt;<i> live under long-term financial obligations. The &#8220;profitability&#8221; of
</I>&gt;<i> student loans seems to be functional for the contemporary capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> order and this function is pedagogical. Subsidised credit &#8220;tames&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> young people for the financial system and simultaneously overcomes
</I>&gt;<i> their cautiousness towards &#8220;living on credit&#8221;. Student loans tend to
</I>&gt;<i> be perceived as an additional income and some student organisations
</I>&gt;<i> protest when the loan is too little to survive. When students in
</I>&gt;<i> Iceland realised that there would not be enough summer jobs for them,
</I>&gt;<i> because of increased unemployment, their organisations started
</I>&gt;<i> lobbying for loans during summer holidays and summer courses to
</I>&gt;<i> support their claim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being aware of long-term obligations changes students&#8217; behaviour &#8211; the
</I>&gt;<i> decision if they should do postgraduate study becomes a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> financial calculation. Previous research shows that debt prevents
</I>&gt;<i> people from further studies, at least in the USA. They also seem to
</I>&gt;<i> influence the decisions of females more than the decisions of males
</I>&gt;<i> (Davies &amp; Lea, 1995; Fox, 1992). People calculate how much education
</I>&gt;<i> they can afford. Thus, debt can have its role as a mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> regulating the number of students at universities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Debt is not a side-effect of education any more, but instead it became
</I>&gt;<i> its primary condition. Thus, Jeffrey Williams (2009) claims that debt
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be understood as a central experience for students and he
</I>&gt;<i> enumerates 6 lessons which form &#8220;the pedagogy of debt&#8221;. Firstly, debt
</I>&gt;<i> teaches that education is only a consumer service. Secondly, it
</I>&gt;<i> teaches to choose career paths which enable people to pay debt back.
</I>&gt;<i> Relatively low interests rates and a long time to pay the debt back
</I>&gt;<i> (in comparison to consumer credits) allows students to ignore the
</I>&gt;<i> significance of starting their career &#8220;in the red&#8221;, but the necessity
</I>&gt;<i> of paying regular instalments makes it difficult for graduates to look
</I>&gt;<i> for alternative or less commercial career paths. Thirdly, debt creates
</I>&gt;<i> a world-view, in which everything is exchangeable on the market.
</I>&gt;<i> Fourthly, it changes the notion of the citizen by redefining the
</I>&gt;<i> social contract into an obligation towards financial institutions,
</I>&gt;<i> which in return enables the indebted citizen to subscribe to public
</I>&gt;<i> services. Fifthly, debt teaches only one value &#8211; that the basic
</I>&gt;<i> dimension of other human beings is their financial potential, i.e. how
</I>&gt;<i> much debt they can carry. Sixthly, debt teaches a very specific type
</I>&gt;<i> of sensitivity. It is based on the fear of losing one&#8216;s job or health
</I>&gt;<i> (Ehrenreich, 1989), which would lead quickly to insolvency and
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently to the financial ruin and social degradation of one's
</I>&gt;<i> family. It is too early to say how effective this pedagogy is, but it
</I>&gt;<i> is important to observe these lessons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND ENSLAVEMENT
</I>&gt;<i> People in debt are not always poor in a way that would allow social
</I>&gt;<i> workers to help them. Both in Poland and in Iceland, support from the
</I>&gt;<i> social security system is restricted to those who have a low income.
</I>&gt;<i> Poverty occurs, however, when indebted people pay instalments before
</I>&gt;<i> satisfying all other needs. It is not always possible to secure a
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient amount of money to survive, since paying debts is
</I>&gt;<i> considered by some a question of honour and respect for oneself. Apart
</I>&gt;<i> from that, people are afraid not to pay their instalments on time,
</I>&gt;<i> since then their debt could rapidly grow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Poland, the reason for rating obligations towards banks higher than
</I>&gt;<i> an obligation towards friends and relatives comes sometimes from the
</I>&gt;<i> psychological terror which debt-collecting departments organise for
</I>&gt;<i> debtors, with the use of communication networks. Sending letters and
</I>&gt;<i> text messages &quot;reminding&quot; the debtor about a delay in paying the debt,
</I>&gt;<i> as well as about the consequences for this lack of discipline; calling
</I>&gt;<i> the debtor and using manipulation techniques in the conversation; or
</I>&gt;<i> even using automatic machines for the conversation with a debtor &#8211; all
</I>&gt;<i> this contributes to an enormous level of stress experienced by people
</I>&gt;<i> who have problems with paying their debts, and, as a consequence, also
</I>&gt;<i> problems in judging their own situation. To show how frequent the
</I>&gt;<i> reminders from banks are, I would like to give an example of a suicide
</I>&gt;<i> from an article &#8222;Ukredytowany&#8221; [Credified = the combination of the
</I>&gt;<i> words credit and crucified] by Joanna Blew&#261;ska (2010; p.3): &quot;He
</I>&gt;<i> received text messages every half hour from many different banks. He
</I>&gt;<i> made a mistake, he got involved in a dangerous spiral. But the banks
</I>&gt;<i> were harassing him. Could they have hoped that he would find the money
</I>&gt;<i> in half an hour? No. It was just to terrorise him!&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting issue related to debt is the so called &#8220;working
</I>&gt;<i> off&#8221; the debt, that is, working for the creditor and paying the debt
</I>&gt;<i> this way (Servet, 2004). This kind of deal gets only positive comments
</I>&gt;<i> in the Polish media (Mikulec, 2010), even though it can easily lead to
</I>&gt;<i> enslavement. Today, working debt off needs the debtor's consent and
</I>&gt;<i> involves mostly housing co-operatives. However, it is slowly spreading
</I>&gt;<i> to schools that collect fees (Sta&#324;czyk &amp; P&#322;osko&#324;ska, 2005; Szumer,
</I>&gt;<i> 2008). However, we can already read that one can work the debt off for
</I>&gt;<i> another person (Moritz, 2009). It does not need much to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> grandchildren working off their grandparents' debts. The occurrence of
</I>&gt;<i> this new servitude can grow, especially if it is not possible to pay
</I>&gt;<i> the debt off and the work lasts forever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBT AND RESISTANCE
</I>&gt;<i> Since debt is related to freedom, debtors sometimes demand political
</I>&gt;<i> representation of their interests. In Poland, a spectacular example of
</I>&gt;<i> such a movement was the farmers' labour union and then the political
</I>&gt;<i> party called &#8220;Samoobrona&#8221; [Self-defence] in the 1990s. Its first
</I>&gt;<i> members were farmers who got into the so called spiral of
</I>&gt;<i> indebtedness. They were constantly endangered by debt collectors. The
</I>&gt;<i> financial and legal situation of the first victims of the new banking
</I>&gt;<i> system in Poland forced them to seek political representation. In
</I>&gt;<i> Iceland, on the other hand, indebted people were mobilised into social
</I>&gt;<i> movements and organisations during the financial crisis. One of these
</I>&gt;<i> organisations was Hagsmunasamt&#246;k heimilanna [Iceland's Home
</I>&gt;<i> Coalition], which organised a pay-strike on all mortgage loan
</I>&gt;<i> payments. Starting political campaigns in order to influence an
</I>&gt;<i> organisation or a country &#8211; by giving Voice &#8211; is after Albert
</I>&gt;<i> Hirschman (1970) seen as a symptom of loyalty to the structures one
</I>&gt;<i> would like to change. The loyalty is probably forced upon individuals
</I>&gt;<i> by the fact that they are not able to act more radically (e.g. because
</I>&gt;<i> of their age) and leave the place (an organisation or a country),
</I>&gt;<i> where they suffer from injustice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The strategy of Exit, considered by Hirschman as an alternative to the
</I>&gt;<i> strategy of Voice, is also a traditional reaction to indebtedness.
</I>&gt;<i> David Graeber claims, in an article introducing his book &#8220;Debt: The
</I>&gt;<i> First Five Thousand Years&#8221; (2009) that already in the ancient Sumerian
</I>&gt;<i> empire, debtors were leaving cities in masses, in order to lead a
</I>&gt;<i> partially criminal nomadic lifestyle far from the power that could
</I>&gt;<i> enslave their family as a result of their unpaid debts. Exit strategy
</I>&gt;<i> is nowadays used by 20,000 student debtors from Sweden. They refused
</I>&gt;<i> to pay their debts and disappeared (probably left the country). The
</I>&gt;<i> Swedish agency responsible for student loans tries to trace them
</I>&gt;<i> internationally to get back the money estimated to be about 340
</I>&gt;<i> million dollars (Simpson, 2009). Even though today personal bankruptcy
</I>&gt;<i> does not lead to slavery, but usually to a long social exclusion from
</I>&gt;<i> the banking system and other spheres of life, still one of the
</I>&gt;<i> reactions to the growing personal indebtedness in Iceland was
</I>&gt;<i> emigration (in 2009 for the first time in Icelandic history more
</I>&gt;<i> people left the island than came there and were born).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Debts were also an important reason for many Poles to come to Iceland
</I>&gt;<i> before the crisis. On the one hand, some came to work in Iceland and
</I>&gt;<i> earn more money than in Poland, so that they could pay their debts
</I>&gt;<i> back home. On the other hand, many migrants that I managed to talk to
</I>&gt;<i> came to Iceland in order to avoid having debt. They were so unwilling
</I>&gt;<i> to buy flats, cars or other things with the use of loans, that they
</I>&gt;<i> were ready to leave their country of origin in order not to have these
</I>&gt;<i> obligations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FINAL NOTES
</I>&gt;<i> To conclude, in the context of the financial crisis indebtedness means
</I>&gt;<i> a significant driving force for people in Iceland. However, debts do
</I>&gt;<i> not necessarily mean poverty. People get into debt for various
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, but in general they do it to improve their lives. However, in
</I>&gt;<i> this paper I tried to present how debt could appear and grow
</I>&gt;<i> independently from loans and how it can make debtors' lives miserable
</I>&gt;<i> and impoverish both themselves and their relatives. Indebtedness makes
</I>&gt;<i> all social differences and inequalities more severe, because it
</I>&gt;<i> exposes people to power. Debt can be collected by the use of
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate violence. People seem to be aware of their vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore there is a relation between debt and migration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exploring fields where debt can occur and influence human behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> and living conditions was aimed to start a discussion about the new
</I>&gt;<i> neoliberal subject &#8211; an indebted human being. It is a heroic
</I>&gt;<i> personality &#8211; either extraordinary active or extraordinary passive.
</I>&gt;<i> These new subjects are both encouraged to debt and blamed for it.
