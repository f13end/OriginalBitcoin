</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Renowned physicist Freeman Dyson identifies&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/ArticleDetail/tabid/68/id/9361/Default.aspx">http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/ArticleDetail/tabid/68/id/9361/Default.aspx</A>&gt;two kinds of scientific revolutions, those driven by new concepts
</I>&gt;<i> (theoretical), and those driven by new tools (technological).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last 500 years we&#8217;ve witnessed paradigm shattering conceptual shifts
</I>&gt;<i> associated with names such as Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, and, Einstein.
</I>&gt;<i> Simultaneously, the evolution of technology drives progress in unpredictable
</I>&gt;<i> ways&#8212;Galileo borrowed principles from the technology of eye-glasses to
</I>&gt;<i> pioneer the use of the telescope in astronomy, while Watson and Crick relied
</I>&gt;<i> on Rosalind Franklin&#8217;s skill with X-ray diffraction (a tool from physics) to
</I>&gt;<i> probe the structure of life.  (Undoubtedly, Franklin&#8217;s contribution would
</I>&gt;<i> have been more fully recognized under a true Open Science Paradigm.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To this classification of scientific revolutions, we can now add a third
</I>&gt;<i> kind, an *Organizational Revolution*, the advent of a truly &#8220;Open
</I>&gt;<i> Science,&#8221; which will profoundly affect the pace and character of subsequent
</I>&gt;<i> theory and tool-driven paradigm shifts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 21st century is off to a rocky start, and as economic and ecological
</I>&gt;<i> crises converge, there is no shortage of dire predictions. On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, politicians and pundits point to the expectation that Science and
</I>&gt;<i> Technology will let humanity invent its way out of the problems we&#8217;ve
</I>&gt;<i> created. This rosy outlook ignores a deep crisis that has been brewing and
</I>&gt;<i> could hamstring our innovative capacity when we most urgently need it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Despite nostalgic myths that Science is the realm of open inquiry, reasoned
</I>&gt;<i> debate, and the pursuit of objective truth, it has always been politicized,
</I>&gt;<i> though never to the dangerous degree attained just in the past decade. The
</I>&gt;<i> viciousness of the fight over embryonic stem cell research, the conflict
</I>&gt;<i> over creationism, and the politics of climate change are unprecedented new
</I>&gt;<i> lows. Public confidence in science and technology is deeply shaken, as the
</I>&gt;<i> outcry over genetically modified organisms attests. When biotechnology, the
</I>&gt;<i> veritable &#8220;toolkit of life,&#8221; that could feed the hungry, heal the ill, and
</I>&gt;<i> fuel the economy without despoiling the environment, is greeted with
</I>&gt;<i> suspicion and downright hostility, we must acknowledge a deep failure.
</I>&gt;<i> Citizens and consumers correctly worry that science has sold them out, as
</I>&gt;<i> companies compromise safety and engineering standards in the dash to control
</I>&gt;<i> the marketplace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beginning in the mid 1980&#8217;s a few judicial decisions, with no public or
</I>&gt;<i> policy deliberation whatsoever, opened the floodgates to an exponential
</I>&gt;<i> expansion in the filing of patents covering new subject matter and
</I>&gt;<i> technologies that were never anticipated in the industrial age during which
</I>&gt;<i> the system evolved. Indeed, there is a growing consensus that the unchecked
</I>&gt;<i> proliferation of intellectual property rights is perversely out of touch
</I>&gt;<i> with, and downright inimical to, the collaborative, cumulative, and
</I>&gt;<i> interdependent essence of innovation in the 21st century&#8217;s networked
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge economy. As the global economy struggles to find a new equilibrium
</I>&gt;<i> after the financial meltdown, it is indisputable that old business models
</I>&gt;<i> are unsustainable&#8212;this applies equally, indeed, especially, to technology
</I>&gt;<i> and biomedicine, where cycles of over-hype, under-deliver, bubble then bust,
</I>&gt;<i> have failed to produce cures for desperate, disappointed, and now
</I>&gt;<i> disillusioned patients, bold proclamations of a &#8220;War on Cancer,&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> notwithstanding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last ten years, a collection of burgeoning movements has begun the
</I>&gt;<i> herculean task of overhauling the outmoded institutions and worldviews that
</I>&gt;<i> make up our global scientific governance system. Proponents of the Access to
</I>&gt;<i> Knowledge movement (A2K) have united around the principle that data and
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge are &#8220;anti-rivalrous,&#8221; the value of information increases as it
</I>&gt;<i> spreads. Open Access Journals have demonstrated a new path for publishing
</I>&gt;<i> that utilizes the power of the internet to instantly distribute ideas
</I>&gt;<i> instead of imposing artificial scarcity to prop up old business models.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Health 2.0&#8221; entrepreneurs are seeking to apply the lessons of e-commerce to
</I>&gt;<i> empower patients. However, these different efforts are each working on a
</I>&gt;<i> piece of a problem without a view of the whole. It is not sufficient or
</I>&gt;<i> realistic to tweak one component of the innovation system (eg, patent
</I>&gt;<i> policy) and assume the others stay static. Instead, dynamic, interactive,
</I>&gt;<i> nonlinear change is unfolding. The Open Science Summit is the first and only
</I>&gt;<i> event to consider what happens throughout the entire innovation chain as
</I>&gt;<i> reform in one area influences the prospects in others. In the best case
</I>&gt;<i> scenario, a virtuous circle of mutually reinforcing shifts toward
</I>&gt;<i> transparency and collaboration could unleash hitherto untapped reserves of
</I>&gt;<i> human ingenuity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine a vastly accelerated research, development, and commercialization
</I>&gt;<i> cycle using an entire Open Innovation process from start to finish. In both
</I>&gt;<i> commercial and academic labs, scientists would log results using Open
</I>&gt;<i> Protocols such as Open Wetware. In the next stage, scientists submit to Open
</I>&gt;<i> Access journals&#8212;but the process of peer review would be ongoing as &#8220;real
</I>&gt;<i> time publication&#8221; allowed researchers to transform results into a
</I>&gt;<i> publication along a continuum that ranged from initial reports to rough
</I>&gt;<i> drafts to final submissions. A paper would never be &#8220;finished&#8221; as critique
</I>&gt;<i> and response would be ongoing long after publication. New, sophisticated
</I>&gt;<i> reputation &#8220;feedback&#8221; algorithms (like those powering Ebay or Amazon but
</I>&gt;<i> optimized for science), supplant the old static journal model. This is
</I>&gt;<i> already emerging to a limited extent with tentative forays into social
</I>&gt;<i> networking software for science and post publication commentary experiments
</I>&gt;<i> such as PLoS One. Young post-docs, instead of laboring under a stultifying
</I>&gt;<i> grant system that rewards conservatism and incrementalism, pitting
</I>&gt;<i> researchers against each other for an artificially limited number of spots,
</I>&gt;<i> could simultaneously compete and collaborate with others around the globe,
</I>&gt;<i> using platforms such as that being developed by India&#8217;s Open Source Drug
</I>&gt;<i> Discovery Foundation. In the past, science has been said to advance one
</I>&gt;<i> funeral at a time, but we can no longer afford to wait for generational
</I>&gt;<i> replacement. Work done on open source projects would allow young researchers
</I>&gt;<i> to build prestige, without regard to traditional hierarchy. Open Innovation
</I>&gt;<i> prizes, offering cash and other rewards for solutions to problems ranging
</I>&gt;<i> from cancer to aging, would spur progress and provide further incentives.
</I>&gt;<i> New &#8220;micro-finance&#8221; platforms for research would enable patients and
</I>&gt;<i> philanthropies to more efficiently direct funds to projects that slip
</I>&gt;<i> through the cracks of the current system while also routing around
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;chokepoints&#8221; such as the NIH which can become a &#8220;single point of failure&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> in science funding (see Bush/stem cells).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, research tools would be widely shared and disseminated, not hidden
</I>&gt;<i> behind industrial secrecy or priced out of reach via an exclusive license.
</I>&gt;<i> Platform &#8220;enabling technologies&#8221; in some of the world&#8217;s most important
</I>&gt;<i> fields would be maintained as a &#8220;protected commons.&#8221; Stem cell lines or
</I>&gt;<i> vectors to be used in gene therapy are prime examples of technologies where
</I>&gt;<i> collective innovation to create an &#8220;Open Standard&#8221; would clearly benefit all
</I>&gt;<i> interested parties, especially patients desperately awaiting cures. The
</I>&gt;<i> widespread penetration of these &#8220;upstream&#8221; technologies would utterly
</I>&gt;<i> transform the landscape of the biotechnology industry, disrupting
</I>&gt;<i> concentrations of power that have accumulated over the past few decades and
</I>&gt;<i> allowing entire ecologies of enterprise to spring up, colonizing a
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;long-tail&#8221; of niches that multi-nationals neglect in the pursuit of only
</I>&gt;<i> the highest margin returns. Once standard, non-proprietary biotech packages
</I>&gt;<i> are available, in principle, launching a biotech startup could come to more
</I>&gt;<i> closely resemble the process of starting an IT company to make web apps
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this revitalized context, as technologies approached commercialization
</I>&gt;<i> stage, a variety of business models would be available using non-exclusive
</I>&gt;<i> licensing and Open Source inspired agreements where appropriate, or allowing
</I>&gt;<i> royalty free use for &#8220;neglected&#8221; diseases, crops, etc. Whatever model a
</I>&gt;<i> particular company pursued would depend on its particular sector of the life
</I>&gt;<i> sciences (diagnostics, vaccines, drug discovery, plant breeding, etc)&#8230; the
</I>&gt;<i> point is that there are a huge range of alternative organizational models
</I>&gt;<i> that have remained unexplored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, regulatory reform would create transparency in clinical trials,
</I>&gt;<i> shifting the funding model to prevent conflicts of interest and ensuring the
</I>&gt;<i> data was publicly available for all to see. Profits would not come at the
</I>&gt;<i> expense of patients.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now look at reality. Without massive coordinated effort we shall surely
</I>&gt;<i> fail to achieve a *Free and Open Science and Technology Paradigm. *The
</I>&gt;<i> vision sketched here needs to come about within the next decade if humanity
</I>&gt;<i> is to make any progress against our interrelated great challenges&#8212;Energy,
</I>&gt;<i> Climate, Health, Food Security, and Poverty. By 2020 there must be a
</I>&gt;<i> distributed, global network of institutions participating in the governance
</I>&gt;<i> of Science and Technology. I hope you share our excitement for this unique
</I>&gt;<i> instant in history when it is finally possible for mankind, a species
</I>&gt;<i> distinguished and defined by its capacity to use tools, to unleash the
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited problem solving powers of the tool of tools, science.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
