</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I ll start with a simple answer :

I guess that in some way, the public history of our current email exchanges
already creates some kind of accreditation / publicly available mutual
recognition ?


A longer answer :

We can set up a project, and then collaboratively, such as on a mind map,
set needs/requests for such project to be developed,

and on such mind map also visualize our connection to such project,
and what needs/requests we may have individually to be able to support such
project ( food, shelter, ... )

We could also visualize every need/request we may have be connected, as it
would be some kind of tag/metadata , to all other similar needs/requests
from other people around us, eventually also relating it to geolocation
metadata.

I imagine also that we could add more tags related to our requests, such as
ask for organic food produced within a certain distance from our location.

We can gather more and more information about potential producers, and have
them included in our networks of interdependency,

and enable them to also express their requests, and ways in which they can
support other peoples or projects requests,

and then enable them to choose who they prefer to support in their requests.

We can then come back to our own projects, and see their interdependence
with other peoples projects, and the needs of such other projects,

and we can enable people to add further data and meta data about the
accreditation of their transactions.

We can enable peers participating in the networked data bases to express
requests related to their support ( such as a IOU type of transaction , or a
specific need to be satisfied to enable them to create such support  )

We can include legal status objects to serve as intermediates for
transactions,
such as specific not for profits, as to enable tax deduction for any
monetary donations to specific requests,

monetary donations which can be accredited and hence offer a form of
reputation, which itself could motivate other peers to support through
donations any requests related to the profile who may have gained such
accreditation.

etc

So I imagine we can create some kind of minmap which could be some kind of
language, using granular elements.

I m not a programmer. Perhaps processing could help ?

<A HREF="http://processing.org/">http://processing.org/</A>

Although I ve been thinking , with Gael, about perhaps learning some
programming laguage such as &quot;small talk&quot; , ...

Or perhaps some other languages could also be useful for such purpose / data
base ?
If it is a system then continually runs, perhaps also &quot;Erlang&quot; ?

I also hope to be able to integrate and use the f2f architecture Robin Upton
is designing and programming.

I also gave a description in my last reply on
