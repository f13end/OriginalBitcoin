<PRE>Hi sepp, I added it as a discussion item ... see
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Application_Content_Infrastructure">http://p2pfoundation.net/Application_Content_Infrastructure</A>

Can you also post it as a blog discussion on the 14th?

&gt;<i>  Hi Michel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here is my view on the wiki entry on Application Content Infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where do you think this should be put to be available to those interested,
</I>&gt;<i> and would you think that the writer of the ACI paper should be advised?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sepp
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very interesting discussion (I just re-read it) and it does touch
</I>&gt;<i> on the question of a user-owned network controlled by peers, although it
</I>&gt;<i> does not delve into how such a network could work. St. Arnaud talks about
</I>&gt;<i> the growing importance of Application Content Infrastructure (ACI) on the
</I>&gt;<i> net, and how much of the traffic that traditionally would go over the
</I>&gt;<i> internet backbone of internet service providers is actually being routed and
</I>&gt;<i> computed and stored in alternative ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *&quot;Examples of ACIs include large distributed caching networks such as
</I>&gt;<i> Akamai, cloud service providers such as Amazon and Azure, Application
</I>&gt;<i> Service Providers (ASPs) like Google and Apple, Content Distribution
</I>&gt;<i> Networks (CDNs) such as Limelight and Hulu, and social networking services
</I>&gt;<i> like Facebook and Twitter. Many Fortune 500 companies like banks and
</I>&gt;<i> airlines have also deployed their own ACIs as an adjunct to their own
</I>&gt;<i> private wide area networks in order to provide secure and timely service to
</I>&gt;<i> their customers. Most major content and application organizations have
</I>&gt;<i> contracted with commercial ACIs or have deployed their own infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> ACIs also allows the content provider to load balance demand, so that
</I>&gt;<i> traffic in regions expressing excessive loads can be re-directed to nodes
</I>&gt;<i> where there is spare capacity.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The end result is that with very little fanfare the Internet has been
</I>&gt;<i> transformed so much so over the past decade that virtually all major content
</I>&gt;<i> and every advanced application on the Internet is now delivered over an ACI
</I>&gt;<i> independent of the traditional carrier Internet backbones.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In effect, the document says that ISPs are following the outdated model of
</I>&gt;<i> the phone companies but aren't really doing their job of connecting users to
</I>&gt;<i> the greater net with sufficient bandwidth for the content, especially video,
</I>&gt;<i> to arrive at the end user in a proper way. It goes on to make the point that
</I>&gt;<i> ACI or Application Content Infrastructure could be expanded, and in
</I>&gt;<i> conjunction with R&amp;E (Regional and Educational) networks could get even
</I>&gt;<i> closer to the end user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *&quot;Up to most recently the text book model of the Internet was for
</I>&gt;<i> businesses and consumers to access the internet through a last mile provider
</I>&gt;<i> such as telephone or cable company. Their traffic would be sent across the
</I>&gt;<i> backbone to its destination by an Internet service provider. This model
</I>&gt;<i> worked reasonably well in the early days of the Internet but as new
</I>&gt;<i> multimedia content such as video and network applications evolved the
</I>&gt;<i> current model failed to provide a satisfactory quality of experience for
</I>&gt;<i> users in terms of responsiveness and speed. As a result a host of content,
</I>&gt;<i> application and hosting companies invested in something for the purposes of
</I>&gt;<i> this paper I have collectively labeled as a Application Content
</I>&gt;<i> Infrastructure (ACI) that complemented and expanded the original Internet
</I>&gt;<i> through the integration of computing, storage and network links.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is left open is how the last mile is going to function. The ISPs seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be too busy metering their pipes and even grading traffic, giving
</I>&gt;<i> priority to certain content and degrading the stuff that is seen as being in
</I>&gt;<i> violation of intellectual property laws and they forget that their job
</I>&gt;<i> includes to connect everyone with a sufficiently wide band connection for
</I>&gt;<i> content not to suffer degradation before arriving at the end user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile networks are mentioned as a possible solution, but with demands
</I>&gt;<i> escalating, they may soon be running into the same trouble as current last
</I>&gt;<i> mile technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a mention of &quot;customer owned networks&quot; but with no vision of how
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve these.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to make a point or two here, just for discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are currently efforts to adapt WIFI technology to build mesh
</I>&gt;<i> networks, but WIFI was conceived as a short range technology and &quot;last mile&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> typically means we may be talking distances between nodes of several hundred
</I>&gt;<i> meters. This degrades signal throughput of WIFI, even with external
</I>&gt;<i> antennas. G3 or G4 mobile phone technology could help, but here we talk
</I>&gt;<i> about competing providers that are not about to share networks with each
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, there are fairly widespread concerns over the huge increase in
</I>&gt;<i> electromagnetic pollution brought to our homes by both WIFI and mobile phone
</I>&gt;<i> technologies, which are not going to go away, unless there is a change in
</I>&gt;<i> technical specs that can assure the electrosensitive that they have a future
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't involve hiding out in far away places or wearing protective
</I>&gt;<i> clothing and installing special shielding in their homes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There IS an interesting technology that does not involve pulsed microwaves
</I>&gt;<i> as the transmission medium and that could - with some help - be made
</I>&gt;<i> available to end users, constructing a tight weave of local connectivity
</I>&gt;<i> that can tap into both ISPs and ACIs and their extensions and that is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently fast and robust to be a candidate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ISPs could perhaps be induced to adopt it as an alternative to building out
</I>&gt;<i> their last mile connectivity alone, which turns out to be very expensive if
</I>&gt;<i> it is to carry broadcast quality content. Users could be the ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> custodians of that type of network but it would imply end users and and ISPs
</I>&gt;<i> forming some kind of alliance, out of which the end users get free local
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity (they supply the electricity and basic maintenance) and ISPs
</I>&gt;<i> get a functioning last mile distribution and customers for their backbone
</I>&gt;<i> services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The vision is to take the light beams that travel through optic cables and
</I>&gt;<i> to replace the cables by simple light-based transmission, preferably laser,
</I>&gt;<i> between the end users. This would form a fault tolerant and fast (high data
</I>&gt;<i> throughput) network from one rooftop to the next, which would make local
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity free and fast. Not every end user would have to be connected to
</I>&gt;<i> the backbone. The user-cloud could be linked by what we might call &quot;super
</I>&gt;<i> users&quot; (those with need for high bandwidth or with need for exceptionally
</I>&gt;<i> stable connection) such as large businesses, educational institutions, city
</I>&gt;<i> hall, etc. to the optic cable backbones. Those connections that are anyway
</I>&gt;<i> needed and already paid for would be quite sufficient to connect the
</I>&gt;<i> user-cloud to the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The technology will need some development, but it has been proven to work
</I>&gt;<i> in concept. One implementation marries ultra wide band radio technology with
</I>&gt;<i> a laser and a single optic fiber:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Moshe Ran, Coordinator of the EU-funded project, UROOF (Photonic
</I>&gt;<i> components for Ultra-wideband Radio Over Optical Fiber), has a vision. He
</I>&gt;<i> wants to see streams of high-definition video and other high-bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> services flowing through homes, office buildings, and even ships and planes,
</I>&gt;<i> through a happy marriage of optical and ultra-wideband radio technologies.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The UROOF EAT system starts with a central laser that generates an
</I>&gt;<i> unmodulated optical signal and sends it through a single optical fibre to
</I>&gt;<i> remote units. In its downlink mode, the central unit receives a UWB radio
</I>&gt;<i> signal, modulates the optical carrier, and beams it to the remote units. In
</I>&gt;<i> the uplink mode, a remote EAT modulates the optical signal and sends it back
</I>&gt;<i> to the central station.*
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The EAT based Access Node 2 has the potential to carry far more
</I>&gt;<i> information than Access Node 1, but there is a catch. &quot;With EAT you can
</I>&gt;<i> approach 60 GHz,&quot; says Ran, &quot;but it is expensive.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The UROOF team is actively working to increase the bandwidth of Access
</I>&gt;<i> Node 2 and reduce its cost.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Ran is encouraged by the progress UROOF has made. They have shown that
</I>&gt;<i> UWB signals can be beamed over hundreds of metres using inexpensive optical
</I>&gt;<i> technology, with greater bandwidth and longer distances in sight.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;As ultra-wideband technology penetrates the mass market - within the
</I>&gt;<i> next two years - it will be possible to manufacture an access node that will
</I>&gt;<i> meet the demand very nicely,&quot; says Ran.*
</I>&gt;<i> ***The UROOF project received funding from ICT strand of the EU's Sixth
</I>&gt;<i> Framework Programme for research.*

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another way of linking is to directly beam the laser from one user's device
</I>&gt;<i> to a receiving sensor of another user as described in the patent application
</I>&gt;<i> of Ajang Bahar of Toronto, Canada.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *The current options for wireless communication have changed the way
</I>&gt;<i> people work and the way in which networks can be deployed. However, there
</I>&gt;<i> remains unresolved problems in the setup and configuration of wireless
</I>&gt;<i> communication links. Both known cellular and ad hoc wireless networking
</I>&gt;<i> protocols and systems are deficient in that the ability for users to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate without a priori knowledge of MAC addresses (represented by
</I>&gt;<i> phone numbers, IP addresses and the like) is limited or may be compromised
</I>&gt;<i> in a hostile environment. In contrast, provided by aspects of the present
</I>&gt;<i> invention are devices, systems and methods for establishing ad hoc wireless
</I>&gt;<i> communication between users that do not necessarily have MAC addresses and
</I>&gt;<i> the like for one another. In some embodiments, a first user visually selects
</I>&gt;<i> a second user and points a coherent light beam at an electronic device
</I>&gt;<i> employed by the second user. Data specific to the first user is modulated on
</I>&gt;<i> the coherent light beam, which can then be demodulated when the coherent
</I>&gt;<i> light beam is received by the electronic device of the second user.*

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a paper by Akella and others of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
</I>&gt;<i> titled *Building Blocks for Mobile Free-Space-Optical Networks.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Optical wireless, also known as free space optics (FSO), is an effective
</I>&gt;<i> high bandwidth communication technology serving commercial point-to-point
</I>&gt;<i> links in terrestrial last mile applications and in infrared indoor LANs. FSO
</I>&gt;<i> has several attractive characteristics such as (i) dense spacial reuse, (ii)
</I>&gt;<i> low power usage per transmitted bit, (iii) license-free band of operation,
</I>&gt;<i> and (iv) relatively high bandwidth. Despite these features it has not been
</I>&gt;<i> considered as a communication environment for general-purpose metropolitan
</I>&gt;<i> area networks or multi-hop ad-hoc networks, which are currently based on
</I>&gt;<i> radio frequency (RF) communication technologies...*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The US military has analyzed Free Space Optics as a transmission technology
</I>&gt;<i> and has produced and published a White Paper:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/25017951/Analysis-of-FSO">http://www.docstoc.com/docs/25017951/Analysis-of-FSO</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that the technology of optical transmission has been explored
</I>&gt;<i> and is technically feasible for last mile applications. Since users can be
</I>&gt;<i> connected to more than one peer, the network becomes fault tolerant.
</I>&gt;<i> Increasing proximity to a super-user, a node connected with the backbone,
</I>&gt;<i> will make for increasing reliability of the network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if telcos and ISPs could be induced to embrace that technology, a
</I>&gt;<i> simple, cheap implementation could be developed that could easilty be given
</I>&gt;<i> away to end users, in exchange for operation of the node. ISPs would have
</I>&gt;<i> resolved the problem of covering the last mile, while users would be linked
</I>&gt;<i> in to the internet at negligible or no cost and we would have a local p2p
</I>&gt;<i> network that data can travel on without having to go through any provider.
</I>&gt;<i> Even in a national context, data would only have to go short hops (such as
</I>&gt;<i> from one city to another) saving backbone capacity and making the net very
</I>&gt;<i> much more resilient.
