&gt;<i> Oil and the Regime of Capitalism: Questions to Philosophers of the
</I>
&gt;<i> Future
</I>
&gt;<i> ==================================================================
</I>


&gt;<i> ~Tere Vaden~
</I>


      &quot;What if the hegemony of the
&gt;<i> West was not, after all, defined
</I>      by modern natural
&gt;<i> science and technology, enlightenment and
</I>      individualism
&gt;<i> but by a one-time offering of coal, gas and oil?&quot;
</I>

The
&gt;<i> anthropological record suggests that, typically, in pre-modern
</I>and
&gt;<i> non-industrialized communities the foundation of meaning is not
</I>separate
&gt;<i> from the world of material income: utility objects are
</I>beautiful and beauty
&gt;<i> is purposeful. Contrary to this, industrial
</I>civilization has often been
&gt;<i> described as a divider of the world of
</I>values and tools, means and
&gt;<i> objectives, which, through calculated
</I>reason, extracts everything it can
&gt;<i> without actually knowing why or
</I>for what purpose.

There is much
&gt;<i> truth in this bi-partition theory, but perhaps an even
</I>more disturbing
&gt;<i> picture of industrial civilization is obtained if it
</I>too is seen as a
&gt;<i> uniform culture that reveals the foundation of
</I>meaning through its utility
&gt;<i> objects. In places all around the globe,
</I>on land and in the sea, pipes
&gt;<i> protrude from beneath the ground,
</I>meandering towards enormous containers and
&gt;<i> networks of more pipes.ct
</I>Oil tankers and tank trucks haul acrid-smelling
&gt;<i> liquids further and
</I>further away to increasingly smaller containers and
&gt;<i> tanks, until the
</I>thin pipes end up in a pressure chamber where droplets
&gt;<i> split into gas
</I>are continuously combusted. What does this simultaneous
&gt;<i> foundation of
</I>meaning and for material life say about us? At the very least,
&gt;<i> it
</I>tells us that if it is the foundation we are blind to it, and the

&gt;<i> bi-partition theory is one form of blindness.
</I>

Capitalism and the
&gt;<i> bottlenecks
</I>------------------------------

Let us examine two claims
&gt;<i> often presented about capitalism. According
</I>to the first claim, capitalism
&gt;<i> is an endlessly adaptive system and
</I>ideology. In an awkward way -- one that
&gt;<i> a revolutionary may almost
</I>loathe -- capitalism can adapt to any
&gt;<i> circumstances. It swallows all
</I>forms of resistance, transforming them into
&gt;<i> part of itself. Revolt
</I>becomes commercialised and made into a product, big
&gt;<i> brother's
</I>extra-large trousers become hip-hop fashion, and ethnic
&gt;<i> identity
</I>becomes commercial bric-a-brac. The second claim is that
&gt;<i> negative
</I>limits can be set for capitalism, particularly in relation to

&gt;<i> environmental problems such as pollution and climate change.
</I>Supposedly,
&gt;<i> there is a physical limit to growth-oriented capitalism
</I>after which nature
&gt;<i> can no longer withstand the use, and a
</I>psycho-social, or even biological
&gt;<i> limit, beyond which man can no
</I>longer endure life under capitalism.


&gt;<i> Our wager is that we can begin thinking about the future in
</I>opposition to
&gt;<i> these claims. Firstly, capitalism is a very fragile
</I>system. Indeed, the
&gt;<i> contemporary complex capitalist system is not
</I>particularly flexible or
&gt;<i> strong, but is instead stiff and weak.
</I>Secondly, environmental problems have
&gt;<i> no limit beyond which they
</I>become intolerable. As long as it happens slowly
&gt;<i> enough, they can
</I>always become worse. Likewise, human psycho-social or
&gt;<i> biological
</I>environments can radically deteriorate without becoming
&gt;<i> impossible.
</I>More than once the last century demonstrated that the zero point
&gt;<i> of
</I>psycho-social conditions can be reached without provoking systemic

&gt;<i> breakdowns.
</I>
It is true that capitalism -- as an abstract notion, as an
&gt;<i> image of a
</I>system where there exists private property, and a society where
&gt;<i> one
</I>is rewarded for ownership and where capital must grow -- is, of

&gt;<i> course, extremely flexible and not dependent on any single value or
</I>social
&gt;<i> order. It can operate in many different climatic conditions,
</I>and accommodate
&gt;<i> many different religious, as well as secular,
</I>environments. No single issue
&gt;<i> determines the fate of abstract
</I>capitalism. For this reason, undermining
&gt;<i> capitalism is difficult
</I>because of its ability to escape final grounding not
&gt;<i> only in any
</I>single issue but also in any complex of individual
&gt;<i> issues.
</I>
The counter-argument is that every concrete form of capitalism,
&gt;<i> every
</I>really existing capitalism -- for example, the system that
&gt;<i> prevails
</I>in Finland, the Nordic countries or northern Europe in general,
&gt;<i> or
</I>something even so abstract as Western capitalism -- is sufficiently

&gt;<i> concrete and consequently sensitive. Marx emphasised that capitalism
</I>itself
&gt;<i> always produces crises, its own crises, moments when it
</I>changes its
&gt;<i> preconditions. Indeed, the fact that capitalism is a
</I>system that produces
&gt;<i> internal crises also demonstrates the claim that
</I>capitalism is fragile.
&gt;<i> Crisis is always crisis: and it can also lead
</I>to destruction.

This
&gt;<i> is linked with a morphological observation concerning forms and
</I>sizes which
&gt;<i> is easiest to explain with an animal allegory. Let us
</I>think, for example, of
&gt;<i> an animal in the shape of a mouse: the mouse
</I>has thin legs, an oblong body,
&gt;<i> a relatively large head with a long
</I>snout, etc. There exist other animals
&gt;<i> that are roughly the same as a
</I>mouse, such as the shrew and rat.
&gt;<i> &quot;Mouse-shaped&quot;, however, cannot be
</I>any size, for instance the size of a dog
&gt;<i> or horse. Its constitution
</I>would not function at that scale. The head would
&gt;<i> be too heavy, the
</I>legs too thin, or something else along those lines.
&gt;<i> &quot;Mouse-
</I>shapedness&quot; cannot arbitrarily grow so that the proportions of
&gt;<i> all
</I>parts remain the same. For the same reason, capitalism reaches a

&gt;<i> crisis point. It cannot continuously grow so that the proportions of
</I>
&gt;<i> different parts remain the same. The parts and the proportions of the
</I>parts
&gt;<i> must change. From this follows delicacy. Every concrete
</I>capitalism is
&gt;<i> extremely frail at some point and in some way delimited
</I>by a morphological
&gt;<i> bottle-neck, namely scarcity. At different moments
</I>and in different concrete
&gt;<i> forms of capitalism the bottleneck is
</I>different.

A second claim,
&gt;<i> according to which environmental problems, pollution,
</I>climate change and so
&gt;<i> forth have no limits, is simultaneously related
</I>to the claim concerning life
&gt;<i> under a capitalist system. In his book
</I>_Planet of Slums_ [1] Mike Davis
&gt;<i> describes the mega-cities of Africa,
</I>Latin America, India, China and
&gt;<i> Indonesia, where tens of millions of
</I>people, and in continuously increasing
&gt;<i> numbers, live in slum
</I>conditions. Davis tells about the single mother in the
&gt;<i> slum, who
</I>already lives in unbearable conditions, is the poorest of the
&gt;<i> poor,
</I>having two jobs, but with no comforts, no water or sanitation.
&gt;<i> What
</I>happens when one more child is born? The mother will bear it. What

&gt;<i> about when the old and sick grandmother has to be taken care of? The
</I>mother
&gt;<i> will bear it because she has to. There is no limit after which
</I>the slum
&gt;<i> mother can no longer bear it because the option of not
</I>bearing it does not
&gt;<i> exist. Demands can always be increased,
</I>circumstances made worse, and she
&gt;<i> will always endure. The same can be
</I>said for more widely based living
&gt;<i> conditions and the environment. As
</I>long as change occurs slowly enough,
&gt;<i> conditions will not likely
</I>appear so negative that people would not consent
&gt;<i> to accommodating
</I>themselves to their (capitalist) fate.

Following
&gt;<i> these leads, we must take a closer look at present
</I>capitalism. Do we
&gt;<i> encounter a negative limit after which we no longer
</I>tolerate it? No. The
&gt;<i> limit of capitalism must therefore be looked for
</I>from the positive side
&gt;<i> through morphological frailty. What are the
</I>preconditions -- environmental
&gt;<i> prerequisites, raw material
</I>prerequisites -- that present capitalism needs?
&gt;<i> Due to the frailty of
</I>capitalism, one must concentrate on what is particular
&gt;<i> and concrete,
</I>what this capitalism needs. What is *this* capitalism?


&gt;<i> Capitalism, which is based on the principle of economic growth,
</I>necessarily
&gt;<i> needs raw materials, free trade, world trade, and
</I>globalization -- though
&gt;<i> there do perhaps exist forms of capitalism
</I>that do not need, for instance,
&gt;<i> world trade. Is there a form of
</I>capitalism that does not need economic
&gt;<i> growth? That is already more
</I>debatable. Can one date the birth of present
&gt;<i> capitalism? One of the
</I>best indicators is the start of economic growth.
&gt;<i> Roughly during the
</I>1820s in Europe there began a long period of economic
&gt;<i> growth and
</I>increased production, which also corresponded with the growth
&gt;<i> in
</I>population: these are depicted by the famous &quot;hockey stick&quot; graph,

&gt;<i> where the point where the handle reaches the blade represents, at the
</I>
&gt;<i> latest, the 1950s. Economic growth is not a generally applicable or
</I>common
&gt;<i> phenomenon. Rather, the incipient economic growth had
</I>comparatively clear
&gt;<i> reasons and forms: coal and the steam engine, the
</I>electric motor and the
&gt;<i> combustion engine, oil and natural gas. The
</I>era of fossil fuels and the
&gt;<i> motors and machines that utilise them is
</I>inseparable from economic growth
&gt;<i> and the bottleneck of present
</I>capitalism.

Therefore, a philosophical
&gt;<i> claim: to a great extent, theoretical
</I>discourse concerning capitalism
&gt;<i> concerns *this* concrete capitalism
</I>and not abstract capitalism, even though
&gt;<i> such discourse is always
</I>aware of its own limited knowledge. For example,
&gt;<i> when Marx and Engels
</I>in _Manifesto of the Communist Party_ (1848)
&gt;<i> characterise capitalism
</I>as a system where &quot;all that is solid melts into air
&gt;<i> and all that is
</I>holy is profaned&quot; [2] the question then is about *this*
&gt;<i> concrete
</I>capitalism based on economic growth that has been fed with
&gt;<i> cheap
</I>fossil fuel energy. This capitalism changes with the economy of
&gt;<i> coal
</I>and oil, like a mouse becomes a dog and a dog becomes an elephant.

&gt;<i> These metamorphoses are not the platonic phenomena of abstract
</I>capitalism
&gt;<i> but are instead directly attached to the movements of
</I>black raw
&gt;<i> materials.
</I>

Oil dependency and the oil peak

&gt;<i> -------------------------------
</I>
Oil dependency means that the present
&gt;<i> capitalism needs cheap oil. Oil
</I>is a non-renewable natural resource.
&gt;<i> &quot;Non-renewable&quot; means that as
</I>oil is used it runs out. The question,
&gt;<i> however, concerning when oil
</I>*completely* runs out is not particularly
&gt;<i> interesting. What is
</I>decisive is the bottleneck question: when does the
&gt;<i> sufficiently
</I>cheap, easy oil that can be pumped in large amounts, run out?
&gt;<i> Oil may
</I>&quot;always&quot; be available somewhere at some price but the point where
&gt;<i> it
</I>starts to hurt, however, is the lack of abundant, cheap oil. The

&gt;<i> question becomes philosophical when we remember that the Marxist
</I>
&gt;<i> theoreticians describe themselves as materialists, who pay attention
</I>at the
&gt;<i> ground level to the concrete forms of production and their
</I>conditions.
&gt;<i> Fossil fuel or energy in general have, however, been
</I>relatively little
&gt;<i> discussed in Marxist theory.
</I>
Famous Marxist political leaders certainly
&gt;<i> realised the importance of
</I>energy -- Lenin had his motto &quot;socialism =
&gt;<i> electricity + the power of
</I>the soviets&quot;; Stalin began his career by
&gt;<i> organizing strikes and
</I>blockades in the Baku oil fields -- but not
&gt;<i> necessarily the
</I>limitations to productivism caused by the finite nature of
&gt;<i> fossil
</I>fuels. Cuba and Latin American countries may provide the crucial

&gt;<i> exceptions to this pattern. In Cuba, the so-called &quot;Special Period&quot;
</I>after
&gt;<i> the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the decades-long US embargo
</I>have,
&gt;<i> without a doubt, made energy a prominent topic for political
</I>thought. In his
&gt;<i> autobiography, speaking with Ignacio Ramonet about
</I>the environmental
&gt;<i> disaster, Fidel Castro makes the crucial
</I>observation: &quot;Marx thought that the
&gt;<i> limit on the development of
</I>wealth lay in the social system, not in natural
&gt;<i> resources, as we know
</I>today.&quot; [3]

Let's think, for example, of work.
&gt;<i> Production can be increased in two
</I>ways; by doing more work or by doing the
&gt;<i> same tasks more efficiently,
</I>more productively. The history of contemporary
&gt;<i> capitalism is the
</I>history of both these branches: efficiency is increased by
&gt;<i> the
</I>division of labour, specialization, technology and automation. At
&gt;<i> the
</I>same time, also more work is carried out: human work and non-human

&gt;<i> work powered by energy. Both Marxists and anti-Marxists have had much
</I>to say
&gt;<i> about how a new labour force is created by turning people into
</I>paid labour.
&gt;<i> Yet surprisingly little has been said precisely about
</I>the increase of
&gt;<i> non-human labour, and its morphological effects. Oil
</I>is not, of course,
&gt;<i> &quot;produced&quot;, even though the term is generally in
</I>use. Oil is not &quot;man-made&quot;.
&gt;<i> It is discovered, extracted and then
</I>used. The use of oil as energy is,
&gt;<i> according to the definition in
</I>physics, &quot;the ability to work&quot;: when burned
&gt;<i> and manipulated, oil does
</I>work. Which factors in *this* capitalist system
&gt;<i> depend upon the
</I>amount of easy and cheap non-human labour? Which of
&gt;<i> these
</I>dependencies are arbitrary, and which ones are necessary?

In
&gt;<i> the 1950s, M. King Hubbert, a geologist working for the Shell
</I>company,
&gt;<i> predicted that oil production in the USA would reach its
</I>peak in 1970, which
&gt;<i> subsequently proved correct, one consequence of
</I>which was the oil crisis of
&gt;<i> the 1970s. [4] The calculations regarding
</I>availability and sufficiency of
&gt;<i> oil are, for many reasons, virtually
</I>secret. First of all, the starting
&gt;<i> points are obscure because the oil
</I>producing countries and oil companies
&gt;<i> have many reasons to keep the
</I>estimates for oil production and the resources
&gt;<i> a secret or to distort
</I>them. This is already in itself an interesting fact
&gt;<i> about the
</I>&quot;transparent market economy&quot;: the market economy itself hides
&gt;<i> the
</I>basis for its continuity as a side product of its own actions.

&gt;<i> Scientifically peer-reviewed information about oil quantities simply
</I>does
&gt;<i> not exist. In the same way as the stock market can act only
</I>under the
&gt;<i> circumstances of unfree and unbalanced information, the
</I>combustion engine of
&gt;<i> *this* capitalism can only keep running if the
</I>fuel gauge is
&gt;<i> unreliable.
</I>
There are many different ways, however, of assessing the
&gt;<i> situation.
</I>Hubbert's classic calculation was based on a simple observation:
&gt;<i> the
</I>production of a single oil well can be described roughly with the

&gt;<i> help of the Gauss curve. Production increases, reaches its peak and
</I>then
&gt;<i> decreases. This is represented by a bell curve, where the
</I>highest point
&gt;<i> represents the moment of peak production (*peak oil* or
</I>*Hubbert's peak*).
&gt;<i> When the output indicators of individual oil wells
</I>are added together we
&gt;<i> still get a bell curve -- a much bigger one. Of
</I>course a curve describing
&gt;<i> production is not totally symmetrical.
</I>Hubbert's first estimate from 1956
&gt;<i> was based on the idea of how much
</I>oil reserves there were in the USA (adding
&gt;<i> together the already
</I>produced oil, the known resources and the assumption of
&gt;<i> still to be
</I>found oil wells). [5]

When the amount of total reserves
&gt;<i> as well as the rise in production
</I>are known, it is also possible to estimate
&gt;<i> the peak point and
</I>decrease in production with the help of the bell curve.
&gt;<i> Hubbert's
</I>second method used as its starting point a curve that included
&gt;<i> the
</I>amount of oil discovered. Production followed the curve of the

&gt;<i> (total) amount of discovered oil with a delay of about 10 years.
</I>Already
&gt;<i> then the number of discoveries was declining, anticipating
</I>future decreases
&gt;<i> in production. Hubbert also calculated the time of
</I>the peak using a third
&gt;<i> method based on the assessment of the success
</I>of oil exploration: how much
&gt;<i> oil has been discovered when 10 million
</I>feet has been drilled in
&gt;<i> exploration. The (total) amount of oil
</I>discovered per drilled million feet
&gt;<i> decreased exponentially. Hubbert
</I>predicted that peak production for the
&gt;<i> entire world would occur in
</I>around the 1980s and 1990s. His methods and
&gt;<i> starting points have
</I>subsequently been made more precise, but the basic
&gt;<i> assessments have
</I>remained the same. [6] The discovery of new oil reserves
&gt;<i> have
</I>decreased for decades and a large number of oil producing nations

&gt;<i> have already passed their oil producing peak. A good example is the
</I>UK,
&gt;<i> which thanks to the oil discovered in the North Sea in the 1970s
</I>became an
&gt;<i> important oil exporter in the 1980s, passed its peak in
</I>1999, and after that
&gt;<i> slid into an oil importing country at the
</I>beginning of the 21st
&gt;<i> century.
</I>

EROEI, or does the cake grow by eating it?

&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------
</I>
Oil is a quite incredible,
&gt;<i> lyrical, metaphysical substance. [7] A
</I>natural scientist would say that oil
&gt;<i> consists of long hydro-carbon
</I>chains. Depending on the different lengths of
&gt;<i> chains and adjacent
</I>impurities, crude oil is classified as light, heavy,
&gt;<i> low-sulphur,
</I>high-sulphur, and so on. Hydro-carbon chains are
&gt;<i> interesting
</I>chemically: they are difficult to manufacture, making them
&gt;<i> requires a
</I>lot of effort and energy, and they have many beautiful
&gt;<i> properties.
</I>The formation of the hydro-carbon chains of oil required an

&gt;<i> unimaginably long period of time. Generally, it is estimated that the
</I>
&gt;<i> largest oil deposits began to form about 400 million years ago (the
</I>human
&gt;<i> species is about 200,000 years old, the first oil rig was built
</I>in
&gt;<i> Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859). One of the oldest known oil
</I>properties
&gt;<i> is that it burns. And in recent times it has been
</I>discovered that it is
&gt;<i> possible to make almost anything from it:
</I>microphones, walls, medicines,
&gt;<i> bags, computer parts, plates,
</I>fertiliser, artificial joints, floor planks,
&gt;<i> and so on. In a way long
</I>hydro-carbon chains are the alchemist's dream, a
&gt;<i> substance from which
</I>you can form anything you desire -- albeit not gold.
&gt;<i> Even when trying
</I>to describe oil in a soberly natural-scientific way --
&gt;<i> chemically,
</I>geologically, paleobiologically -- one ends up almost inevitably
&gt;<i> with
</I>ecstatic and mystic visions.

In one year approximately one
&gt;<i> cubic mile of oil is used globally. [8]
</I>Correspondingly, in the 21st century
&gt;<i> global consumption has been
</I>about 85 million barrels per day. Contained in a
&gt;<i> cubic mile of oil is
</I>an enormous amount of energy, the ability to carry out
&gt;<i> work. The same
</I>amount of energy would be obtained if 50 nuclear power plants
&gt;<i> of the
</I>type at Olkiluoto in Finland would produce electricity
&gt;<i> continuously
</I>for 50 years (or put differently, if 2500 Olkiluoto nuclear
&gt;<i> power
</I>plants would operate continuously for one year). Similarly, 104

&gt;<i> coal-fired power plants of 500 megawatts would be needed to operate
</I>for 50
&gt;<i> years (or 5200 such plants for one year). Nobody is prepared
</I>to calculate
&gt;<i> how much carbon-dioxide emissions that would create. In
</I>the same vein, one
&gt;<i> could consider what it would mean to build 2500
</I>new nuclear power plants.
&gt;<i> Would there be enough steel, concrete,
</I>uranium, time, money... Here is a
&gt;<i> view into the cruel beauty of oil:
</I>a cubic mile is, after all, not an
&gt;<i> impossibly large mass, [9] but the
</I>energy it creates is virtually stellar.
&gt;<i> Only the sun exceeds oil in
</I>energy amounts, and oil is, of course,
&gt;<i> &quot;preserved sun&quot;.
</I>
The enormity can be further illustrated by transforming
&gt;<i> these issues
</I>into human labour -- these transformations are, naturally, a
&gt;<i> mere
</I>play of ideas and contain simplifications and unsubstantiated

&gt;<i> assumptions. It is estimated that the energy consumption of the
</I>entire world
&gt;<i> in 2005 was 15 terrawatts. [10] Out of this roughly 13
</I>terawatts was
&gt;<i> accounted for by fossil fuels. Let us presume that one
</I>human can work with
&gt;<i> an efficiency of 100 watts. If in 2005 there were
</I>6.5 billion people on the
&gt;<i> planet their total annual work efficiency
</I>(maximally) was 0.65 terawatts.
&gt;<i> Fossil fuel, in other words, gave
</I>each person a 20-fold work increase (and
&gt;<i> other types of energy about
</I>a triple increase). Because the energy increase
&gt;<i> has not been spread
</I>evenly around the globe, one can assume that a typical
&gt;<i> Westerner has
</I>tens of &quot;oil slaves&quot; in his service. If all this work were
&gt;<i> carried
</I>out with human labour, 20 times more labour would be needed in
&gt;<i> the
</I>world.

The gauge of the enormous work ability of oil is also
&gt;<i> accounted for
</I>with a ratio called EROEI, &quot;Energy Return on Energy Invested&quot;.
&gt;<i> The
</I>matter in itself is simple. EROEI measures how much energy is

&gt;<i> required when a certain amount of energy is used; in other words, how
</I>much
&gt;<i> potential additional energy is acquired by doing some actual
</I>amount of work
&gt;<i> (e.g. how much heating energy is obtained when
</I>firewood is chopped for a
&gt;<i> couple of hours). EROEI is not the same as
</I>thermal efficiency, which
&gt;<i> measures how large an amount of the used
</I>energy goes towards the intended
&gt;<i> purpose and how much goes wasted as
</I>heat, etc. At the most, EROEI could be
&gt;<i> seen as the thermal efficiency
</I>of energy acquisition work: i.e. how much
&gt;<i> work must be done, for
</I>example, to fill a barrel with oil; is the amount of
&gt;<i> work greater or
</I>smaller than the energy contained in a barrel of oil? EROEI
&gt;<i> is
</I>calculated by dividing the amount of energy gained by the energy

&gt;<i> expended. If the number is greater than 1 we get an &quot;energy profit&quot;,
</I>but if
&gt;<i> it is smaller we get a loss. Again, an example from the animal
</I>kingdom will
&gt;<i> help to illustrate. The capercaillie in the wintry
</I>forest needs energy to
&gt;<i> keep warm, for digestion, to move about, and
</I>maybe a little bit for growth
&gt;<i> and renewal. Energy is obtained by
</I>eating spruce needles. If the frost
&gt;<i> condition is severe, the bird
</I>will need to fly far to obtain sustenance.
&gt;<i> Energy-wise, its day is
</I>likely to flip to the negative side of the EROEI
&gt;<i> calculation.
</I>Realistically, it would have been better for the bird to
&gt;<i> have
</I>remained in its snow shelter. Obviously, a state of negative EROEI

&gt;<i> cannot last long.
</I>
So now we return to the bottleneck of capitalism when
&gt;<i> studying the
</I>best oil and gas fields, which have an EROEI ratio in the
&gt;<i> tens.
</I>According to the most optimistic claims, the EROEI of some oil
&gt;<i> fields
</I>would have been even over 100; in other words, with the work of
&gt;<i> one
</I>oil barrel one would have gotten 100 new barrels of oil. [11] Maybe

&gt;<i> it is possible to believe such claims when one remembers how in old
</I>films
&gt;<i> oil is shown spurting from the ground. At its easiest, oil can
</I>indeed be
&gt;<i> found directly under the surface. These most easily
</I>discovered and
&gt;<i> productive oil fields are naturally used up first, and
</I>the EROEI of the
&gt;<i> fields in present production is well under 100,
</I>under 50, if not even under
&gt;<i> 20.
</I>
Virtually free -- or at least manifold rewarding -- energy
&gt;<i> spurting
</I>out from the ground: herein lies the material and mystical
&gt;<i> foundation
</I>of growth-oriented capitalism. It is mystical because it masks
&gt;<i> its
</I>existence so that neither capitalist nor anti-capitalist theory

&gt;<i> refers to it when explaining economic growth and changes in the
</I>economic
&gt;<i> systems over the last 150 years. The oil of the high EROEI
</I>is the pulse of
&gt;<i> the economy but, to employ a different metaphor, it
</I>also produces a blind
&gt;<i> spot in the middle of the theoretical analysis
</I>of growth.

&gt;<i>From the
</I>&gt;<i> same black spot slither out also horrific tentacles.
</I>Division of labour and
&gt;<i> technological development have raised
</I>productivity. Billions of people have
&gt;<i> taken up and been born into
</I>paid labour instead of life. From this obviously
&gt;<i> follows economic
</I>growth. But at the same time the best energy sources of all
&gt;<i> time have
</I>been bled dry. The stored solar energy of countless ancient years
&gt;<i> has
</I>been used up in mere moments. As mentioned earlier, the work carried

&gt;<i> out by this extra energy is ten times larger in comparison to human
</I>work.
&gt;<i> The capitalist and socialist economic systems of the last
</I>century received a
&gt;<i> unique gift; unique in the sense that there is
</I>only one gift, and unique in
&gt;<i> the sense that the gift has soon been
</I>used up. Worst of all is how dependent
&gt;<i> the post-green revolution
</I>intensive farming is on the high EROEI oil.
&gt;<i> Farming with tractors,
</I>combine harvesters, and artificial fertilisers made
&gt;<i> from natural gas
</I>are not &quot;primary production&quot; but, from the EROEI
&gt;<i> perspective, a way
</I>to consume energy. [12] We eat tons of
&gt;<i> fossil-fuels.
</I>
&gt;<i>From uniqueness follows, inevitably, further questions. If
</I>&gt;<i> many
</I>generally applicable observations of political economy science are

&gt;<i> concerned not with abstract capitalism (or socialism) [13] but rather
</I>the
&gt;<i> uniquely oil-injected capitalism, then could the same category
</I>error be
&gt;<i> evident also in some critiques of modernism, technology or
</I>the Western
&gt;<i> lifestyle? What if the hegemony of the West was not,
</I>after all, defined by
&gt;<i> modern natural science and technology,
</I>enlightenment and individualism but
&gt;<i> by a one-time offering of coal,
</I>gas and oil? As is well known, natural
&gt;<i> science and technology,
</I>enlightenment and individualism cannot be exported
&gt;<i> -- and have not
</I>once been exported -- without also exporting and using coal,
&gt;<i> gas and
</I>oil. The Catholic faith needed only coal and wind.


From
&gt;<i> the Bottleneck to Tate
</I>---------------------------

In Alfonso
&gt;<i> Cuaro's film ~Children of Men~ (2006) people in the year
</I>2027 are living in
&gt;<i> a dystopian world where no children have been born
</I>since 2009. At one point
&gt;<i> in the film, the sympathetic character
</I>Jasper (played by Michael Caine), who
&gt;<i> was apparently modelled on John
</I>Lennon, tells a joke. All the geniuses of
&gt;<i> the world have been
</I>gathered together in a conference that tries to
&gt;<i> establish the cause
</I>for the infertility: chemicals, radiation, mutation...
&gt;<i> In the corner
</I>sits an Englishman who does not participate in the discussion
&gt;<i> but
</I>gorges himself on the conference food. Eventually others ask for his

&gt;<i> opinion on why &quot;we can't make babies anymore?&quot; And he replies, &quot;I
</I>haven't
&gt;<i> the faintest idea, but this stork is quite tasty isn't he?&quot;
</I>
Calculating
&gt;<i> the EROEI of different forms of energy is not easy if
</I>indeed possible at
&gt;<i> all. What should be taken into account when
</I>calculating the EROEI of, for
&gt;<i> example, nuclear energy? Building the
</I>power plant itself surely, as well as
&gt;<i> quarrying the uranium and
</I>transport. What about the final disposal of the
&gt;<i> waste? For what
</I>period of time? And what about the power grid,
&gt;<i> transformers,
</I>accumulators...? What about the training required for experts
&gt;<i> in
</I>nuclear power? In any case, the number of energy slaves goes down

&gt;<i> rapidly with diminishing EROEI. No known energy source can even get
</I>close to
&gt;<i> the EROEI figures of the best oil fields (coal comes
</I>closest), particularly
&gt;<i> not nuclear energy, the EROEI calculation of
</I>which may be less than one. Not
&gt;<i> a single nuclear power plant has been
</I>built without a considerable
&gt;<i> consumption of fossil fuel. [14] Roughly
</I>the same applies to all so-called
&gt;<i> alternative energy sources. Their
</I>planning, construction and maintenance
&gt;<i> requires considerable amounts
</I>of high EROEI fossil fuels, and they
&gt;<i> themselves produce energy with a
</I>much lower EROEI. &quot;Why is there
&gt;<i> continuously less energy left over?&quot;
</I>&quot;I don't know, but come here and have a
&gt;<i> look at what kind of solar
</I>panel we built...&quot;

Nobody knows the
&gt;<i> steepness of the down-slope of the bell curve.
</I>Besides the Export Land Model
&gt;<i> (see footnote 6), it is steepened by
</I>the decrease of the EROEI of the
&gt;<i> producing oil wells. The new and
</I>already productive oil wells are
&gt;<i> increasingly in more difficult
</I>locations -- deeper under the sea, etc. --
&gt;<i> and contain crude oil of
</I>an increasingly inferior quality, such as the
&gt;<i> famous &quot;oil sands&quot; of
</I>Canada, which are really a tar-like substance, if not
&gt;<i> asphalt-like
</I>stone. When descending along the down slope of the bell curve,
&gt;<i> an
</I>increasingly larger part of the economy must be directed at energy

&gt;<i> production; in other words, an increasingly smaller part of energy is
</I>in the
&gt;<i> service of the rest of the economy.
</I>
It is possible that there exists an
&gt;<i> unknown limit for what the EROEI
</I>of the energy economy must be so that
&gt;<i> *this* capitalism can function.
</I>[15] One part of the ongoing crisis is that
&gt;<i> the summit of the bell
</I>curve has already been passed. Since 2003 the oil
&gt;<i> consumption of the
</I>OECD countries has been on a slight decline.
&gt;<i> Correspondingly, the
</I>price of oil went up from the 2001 level (20-30 dollars
&gt;<i> a barrel) to
</I>the crazy price peak of 2008 (at its highest almost 150 dollars
&gt;<i> a
</I>barrel; in 2009 almost 70 dollars a barrel). These two trends
together
&gt;<i> describe, with the help of the law of demand, the
</I>unrenewability of oil;
&gt;<i> even though the price of oil multiplied in a
</I>few years production (or
&gt;<i> consumption) did not go up. The peak moment
</I>of global oil production was
&gt;<i> somewhere around the summer of 2005. How
</I>far down the slope are we now?
&gt;<i> Nobody knows, but in any case it has
</I>come so far that production cannot be
&gt;<i> compared to what it was in
</I>2005, and the time of sustained industrial
&gt;<i> economic growth and the
</I>very cheapest oil has passed. [16]

In the
&gt;<i> beginning of the 1980s the energy consumption per capita in
</I>the USA ceased
&gt;<i> to grow. The increase of energy no longer functioned
</I>as a motor for economic
&gt;<i> growth, as it had during the whole time since
</I>the 1860s, with the exception
&gt;<i> of the 1970s. From then onwards, US
</I>economic growth has been reliant on
&gt;<i> debt. The ending of the energy
</I>excess is one reason for the increase in the
&gt;<i> number of loans. And the
</I>waning of cheap oil is one reason for the increase
&gt;<i> in costs for the
</I>continuous taking of loans. The financial crisis and the
&gt;<i> oil crisis
</I>are closely linked; amidst the lost growth shines the black light
&gt;<i> of
</I>the oil well. The recession that we are currently living in is the

&gt;<i> first one of its kind since the Second World War, at least according
</I>to two
&gt;<i> gauges: for the first time the world's economic production is
</I>decreasing and
&gt;<i> for the first time the number of miles driven by car
</I>is decreasing.


&gt;<i> Due to the present crisis, the famous invisible hand cannot optimally
</I>use up
&gt;<i> resources. When the price of oil per barrel is simultaneously
</I>too high for
&gt;<i> the consumer and too low for the producer, that too is a
</I>fault of the
&gt;<i> decreasing EROEI. Instead of the law of demand putting
</I>things in order, it
&gt;<i> pushes a wedge between consumers and producers.
</I>Consequently, new drilling
&gt;<i> projects are put on hold and productive
</I>oil wells are abandoned; the
&gt;<i> invisible hand masks the resource while
</I>at the same time there is a
&gt;<i> shortage. 'The invisible hand' may be one
</I>of those thought experiments that
&gt;<i> only work in a capitalism into
</I>which one can continuously feed more cheap
&gt;<i> energy. The invisible hand
</I>has a harder time under the conditions of a
&gt;<i> shrinking or stagnant
</I>economy.

Also, in the era of &quot;negative growth&quot;
&gt;<i> division of labour as a cause
</I>of prosperity becomes suspect. Division of
&gt;<i> labour is surely one of
</I>the reasons for economic growth during the last 150
&gt;<i> years, but was it
</I>itself a result of the high EROEI ratio of fossil fuels?
&gt;<i> Lasse
</I>Nordlund [17] has shown in experiments that in the living
&gt;<i> conditions
</I>of eastern Finland an adult can feed himself by using a 400m^2
&gt;<i> area
</I>of farming land, as well as additionally picking mushrooms and

&gt;<i> berries in the surrounding forest. According to Nordlund's
</I>calculation, this
&gt;<i> requires about 4 hours of work a day divided evenly
</I>throughout the whole
&gt;<i> year. Nordlund is suspicious not only towards
</I>animal husbandry but also
&gt;<i> towards metal tools, because in a
</I>self-reliant economy they are easily more
&gt;<i> trouble than they are
</I>worth. From this viewpoint, specialization, and
&gt;<i> becoming tool and
</I>technology dependent, explicitly require a continuous feed
&gt;<i> of excess
</I>energy. It is possible that an important part of the
&gt;<i> specialization
</I>and technologization of the modern world is dependent on and
&gt;<i> caused
</I>by the magnificent, uniquely high EROEI of large oil wells. If
&gt;<i> this
</I>is the case, then the claim that modern prosperity is mainly the

&gt;<i> effect of improved technology and specialization, has to be revised.
</I>


&gt;<i> And finally to the beginning
</I>----------------------------

The first
&gt;<i> conclusion in this situation is somewhat self-evident. If
</I>economic growth is
&gt;<i> based on more work [18] (in terms of either amount
</I>or productivity) and if
&gt;<i> the EROEI of all known energy sources is
</I>considerably weaker than the EROEI
&gt;<i> of the oil fields that have
</I>already been used up or are now in production,
&gt;<i> then the future
</I>possibilities for an economy that continuously has to grow
&gt;<i> (in other
</I>words *this* capitalism) seem weak. In fact, only a
&gt;<i> technological
</I>miracle can save continuous growth and technological novelty
&gt;<i> cannot
</I>be anticipated ~a priori~. Empirically, we see that all methods
&gt;<i> of
</I>energy production in use are based on rather old technology and

&gt;<i> science (the first versions of solar panels are from the end of the
</I>1800s,
&gt;<i> the modern versions form the 1940s and nuclear power from
</I>roughly the same
&gt;<i> decade). Does this promise fast breakthroughs or
</I>rather the opposite? In any
&gt;<i> case, barring ground-breaking new energy
</I>technology such as cold fusion,
&gt;<i> economic growth will in the future be
</I>local and short term. What does the
&gt;<i> continuous shrinking of the
</I>economy mean for science, technology, modernism
&gt;<i> and individualism? If
</I>it means something significant at all, we have to
&gt;<i> realise that many
</I>of the theories concerning these phenomena -- which are
&gt;<i> based on the
</I>idea that fossil fuel driven economic growth has nothing
&gt;<i> essential to
</I>do with them -- turn out to be limited and maybe even
&gt;<i> unfounded.
</I>
Emphasis on economic growth, technology and efficiency
&gt;<i> have
</I>characterised the major part of the political thinking of the last

&gt;<i> century. Therefore it is perhaps not surprising that an ideological
</I>
&gt;<i> blindness to the basis of economic growth has been widespread. A
</I>culture
&gt;<i> that is not aware of its own basic prerequisites can be
</I>called not only
&gt;<i> blind but also nihilistic. If many
</I>socio-philosophical ideas have
&gt;<i> unknowingly been based on the
</I>assumption that a unique and in some sense
&gt;<i> arbitrary phenomenon
</I>(i.e., economic growth based on high EROEI fossil
&gt;<i> fuels) is
</I>universal, and have incorporated this blind spot into almost all
&gt;<i> our
</I>thinking concerning modern economy, politics and technology, then
&gt;<i> our
</I>glass is both half empty and half full. Half empty in that not many

&gt;<i> philosophers, economists, critics of modernism or social thinkers
</I>have said
&gt;<i> a rational word about the future where the economy shrinks
</I>year after year.
&gt;<i> We have arrived in an uncharted region, where the
</I>unknown is fully
&gt;<i> equivocal. Half full: talk about the end of history
</I>and other cultural
&gt;<i> saturation should be forgotten. Even a large part
</I>of philosophy can be
&gt;<i> started again from the beginning.

</I>
&gt;<i> companies and oil companies have real time information that is not
</I>published
&gt;<i> or is only available at a price. Therefore the best public
</I>assessments are
&gt;<i> compiled by various peer groups and independent
</I>researchers and journalists.
&gt;<i> Networks exist that gather information
</I>from several sources; for example,
&gt;<i> counting (on the basis of
</I>satellite photos) how many oil tankers pass
&gt;<i> through the Strait of
</I>Hormuz at a certain time period, or how much oil
&gt;<i> drilling equipment
</I>has been ordered recently, and so forth. In this way it
&gt;<i> is possible
</I>to estimate, for example, the oil production of Saudi Arabia,
&gt;<i> which
</I>otherwise is a closely guarded secret. The information is compiled

&gt;<i> and assessed on many different internet sites, including Wikipedia
</I>(e.g. &gt; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_megaprojects"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_megaprojects&quot;</A> target=_blank
&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_megaprojects">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_megaprojects</A>). A good example
</I>of the
&gt;<i> oddities of the &quot;scientific&quot; information concerning oil --
</I>whether economic
&gt;<i> or engineering science -- is the so-called Export
</I>Land Model (ELM). ELM has
&gt;<i> been developed on the Internet site &quot;The
</I>Oil Drum&quot; (&gt; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.theoildrum.com/"/">http://www.theoildrum.com&quot;</A> target=_blank &gt;
<A HREF="http://www.theoildrum.com/">http://www.theoildrum.com</A>),
&gt;<i> where professionals and
</I>amateurs in different fields -- oil engineers,
&gt;<i> investors, geologists,
</I>environmental activists, prophets of doom -- discuss
&gt;<i> oil news.
</I>According to the ELM model, the right side of the bell curve,
&gt;<i> that
</I>is, the recession, will be much steeper than the left edge, that
&gt;<i> is,
</I>the growth period. This is because the producer countries' own

&gt;<i> consumption increases (as they get richer) at the same time as their
</I>
&gt;<i> production decreases. Often, in the producer countries consumption of
</I>oil
&gt;<i> goes *up*, when price goes up. There is thus less oil for export
</I>than what
&gt;<i> one might expect based merely on geological depletion. Even
</I>such a simple
&gt;<i> thing has had to be invented outside the &quot;official&quot;
</I>economic science and
&gt;<i> research because the public information and
</I>research concerning oil is
&gt;<i> rather limited and basic.
</I>
[7] Correspondingly, some of the best
&gt;<i> descriptions of the
</I>world-historic relevance of oil are literary. The
&gt;<i> metaphysical and
</I>mystical character of oil is beautifully exposed in
&gt;<i> Reza
</I>Negarestani's _Cyclonopedia_ (Melbourne: Re-press, 2008) where one
&gt;<i> of
</I>the themes is the blind but necessary infestation that oil exerts.

[8] The cube model and its

</I>to illustrate oil use, but the
&gt;<i> correspondences have also with good
</I>reason been criticised. See, for

[12] Calculating the EROEI figure for mechanised
&gt;<i> modern agriculture
</I>is difficult and depends on many details. It is often
&gt;<i> stated that its
</I>EROEI figure would be approximately 0.1; in other words, by
&gt;<i> using the
</I>energy of ten barrels of oil, the amount of food corresponding to
&gt;<i> the
</I>energy of 1 barrel of oil is achieved. See, for example, Chad

&gt;<i> Hellwinckel and Daniel De La Torre Ugarte, &quot;Peak Oil and the
</I>Necessity of
&gt;<i> Transitioning to Regenerative Agriculture&quot;, _Energy
</I>Bulletin_, 6 October

</I>(accessed 14 October 2009).


&gt;<i> [13] It has been suggested that the passing of the oil peak in 1987
</I>was a
&gt;<i> contributing reason to the collapse of the Soviet Union. See,
</I>for example,
&gt;<i> Douglas B. Reynolds, &quot;Peak Oil and the Fall of the
</I>Soviet Union&quot;, _Energy
&gt;<i> Bulletin_, 28 August 2006.

[14] The only non-labour intensive way of getting rid of
&gt;<i> nuclear
</I>waste is probably to dump it in the sea, in the style of the
&gt;<i> Italian

</I>
[16] The widespread collapse of the economy could possibly lower
&gt;<i> the
</I>price of oil back to a level of 20 dollars a barrel. The collapse

&gt;<i> would, in itself, be the end of *this* capitalism.

</I>Human Labour, Money and
&gt;<i> Energy from Self-Sufficiency Standpoint_ (New

&gt;<i> [18] The calculated and reported economic growth can also be based
</I>on, for
&gt;<i> example, taking loans, printing new money or the rise of the
</I>value of stock
&gt;<i> shares. For these no or minimal additional labour
</I>would be needed.
