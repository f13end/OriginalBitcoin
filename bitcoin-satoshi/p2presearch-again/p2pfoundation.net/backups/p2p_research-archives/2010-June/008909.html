WHOLE, WHOLE ON THE RANGE
A quarter of the land area of Earth is turning into desert. Three quarters
of
the planet's savannas and grasslands are degrading. And because the main
activity on rangelands is grazing livestock, on which 70% of the world's
poorest
people depend, grassland deterioration therefore causes widespread poverty.
Enormous research efforts have been made to understand and reverse
desertification but, until recently, and with one remarkable exception, to
no
avail. That exception, Operation Hope, has transformed 6500 acres of of
parched
and degraded grasslands in Zimbabwe into lush pastures replete with ponds
and
flowing streams - even during periods of drought. Allan Savory, who's behind
the
programme, is a kind of James Lovelock of rangelands management: ridiculed
by
the scientific mainstream for decades, he is now achieving recognition.
Savory
is the winner in the year's Buckminster Fuller Challenge, for which your
correspondent was a jury member. Read more at:
<A HREF="http://www.doorsofperception.com/archives/2010/05/whole_whole_on.php">http://www.doorsofperception.com/archives/2010/05/whole_whole_on.php</A>
<A HREF="http://tiny.cc/z5d5f">http://tiny.cc/z5d5f</A>

FROM GREEN REVOLUTION - TO BROWN
Savory's work has far wider implications than desertification alone. His
approach contains the elements of a new approach to agriculture. The Green
Revolution was based on high input, industrial agriculture. It involved
massive
inputs of petro-chemicals and herbicides, monoculture cropping, excessive
use of
water, and confinement animal feeding operations. Yes, it increased global
food
production tremendously; but, charges Savory, &quot;the Green Revolution has not
been
characterized by ecological or social integrity&#8212;quite the contrary. Horrific
soil erosion, dead zones at the mouths of rivers, severely depleted levels
of
biodiversity, impoverished rural communities, soil fertility loss, and
oxidation
of soil organic matter, have been exacerbated by the Green Revolution&quot;.
Savory
promotes the necessity of a new 'Brown Revolution', based on the
regeneration of
covered, organically rich, biologically thriving soil, and brought to
fruition
via millions of human beings returning to the land and the production of
food.

FROM KNOWLEDGE CENTRAL, TO FEET IN THE FIELD
Staying with green vs brown revolutions: Grameen Foundation has been
developing
a distributed network of intermediaries, or Community Knowledge Workers
(CKWs)
in Uganda. The initiative uses mobile devices to &quot;extend the reach of
centralized expertise&quot; to &quot;feet in the field&quot;. The project begs a heap of
important questions about the nature of that centralised knowledge. It's
funded,
for a start, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which has been heavily
criticised for its focus on high-tech and monocultural solutions to the food
issue. Writing in Grist, Tom Philpott says that although the Gates
Foundation
&quot;has been very careful not to associate itself too closely with
patent-protected
biotechnology as a panacea for African farmers&quot;, Gates himself has &quot;chided
the
critics of GMOs&quot; and declared that &quot;some of our grants [in Africa] do
include
transgenic approaches, because ...they have the potential to address
farmers'
challenges more efficiently than conventional techniques.&quot; Grameen insists
that
its CKWs are &quot;crucial for contextualizing knowledge&quot; and that they provide
&quot;a
channel to represent the voice of the farmer&quot;. But Kenyan biodiversity
leader
Josphat Ngonyo, thinks the Seattle philanthropist is pursuing a strategy
that
will largely help corporate agricultural interests and hurt smallholder
farmers.

TELLING PORKIES: THE BIG FAT LIE ABOUT FOOD PRODUCTION
Statistics about the need to increase global food production by fifty
percent by
2030 and for it to double by 2050, have been widely used by scientists,
politicians, agriculture and GM industry lobbyists. These apparently
scientific
statistics dominate policy and media discourse about food and farming.
However,
when the Soil Association looked into the reported sources for these
figures,
none actually stated that global food production needs to increase by these
amounts. Read the report - Telling porkies: The big fat lie about food
production - here:

FOOD LOOP
FoodLoop a design-led social enterprise for the localized composting of
biodegradable waste on housing estates in London.The service, which is
staffed
by disadvantaged people, provides a door-to-door service among inner-city
flats.
FoodLoop workers learn gardening and landscaping skills, and use the compost
to
cultivate fruit and vegetable plants on communal areas of the estate. A
specially designed community composting machine, the Rocket Composter, is
installed on each estate and managed by local residents. The first FoodLoop
project is up and running on Maiden Lane in Camden Town in London.

PEOPLE'S SUPERMARKET
David Barrie writes to tell me that anyone can join The People's
Supermarket,
which has just opened in London - but as a member you must work in the shop
for
a few hours every month. Because the workforce is nearly all volunteers,
staff
costs are kept low - which means shopping can be cheaper; any profits go
back
into making the food even cheaper.

DE-GROWTH
The the new UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, describes his department as
the
'Ministry of Growth'. And an increasingly deranged NESTA, the innovation
think-tank, calls economic growth &quot;the universal solvent of politics&quot;.
Universal
dissolvent of life on earth, more likely. The True Cost Campaign describes
GDP
as a 'doomsday machine' because it rewards economic activity that destroys
the
biosphere. But new tools to measure economic progress are now emerging. In
Barcelona last month, 500 scientists, civil society members and practioners
discussed 'degrowth' and ways to change the relationship between paid and
unpaid
work. Among the terrific posters that may be downloaded are, &quot;Less
consumption
more wellbeing: evidence from the policies of Italian Virtuous
Municipalities'
Association&quot;, and &quot;Does consumption of market goods relates to well-being?
An empirical test in the Bolivian Amazon&quot;. On 19 June in Leeds, UK, a
similar
(one would imagine) crowd will discuss the idea of a 'steady state economy'.

LOCAL MONEY
In past recessions and depressions, a popular response from communities has
been
to create their own forms of money. An inspiring yet practical new
Transition
Book, Local Money, helps you understand what money is and what makes good
and
bad money; it also reviews how people around the world and in the past have
experimented with new forms of money that they create themselves.

SWEATING PUBLIC ASSETS
&gt;<i>From vacant office blocks and unused green spaces to the schools, libraries
</I>and
other public buildings which are too often locked up at night, more can be
done
to 'sweat' public assets. But the idea of the temporary use of land and
assets
by civil society has gained currency since the economic downturn. While the
private sector has had particular success bringing unoccupied shop fronts or
empty commercial office buildings back into use during the recession, unused
public sector assets have largely remained as such. A new report from The
Young
Foundation focuses on three examples:
community access to vacant land - perhaps to create a community garden or
play
area; empty building - temporary use of empty office spaces, disused
shelters or
community spaces by community groups or social enterprises; and access to
under-used spaces - for peer support groups or community partnerships to
easily
access schools, libraries or GP surgeries out of hours.

WHAT SHOULD DESIGN CRITICS WRITE ABOUT?
What issues should the next generation of design critics write about? Where
and
how should they do this writing? And, how will they get paid for doing so?
The
text of my keynote talk to Crossing The Line at the School for Visual Arts
in
New York is now online.

GREEN SHIPS FOR BILLIONAIRES
The world's marine shipping fleet, which 60,000 vessels strong, moves 90
percent
of the world's internationally traded goods. The fuel these ships burn is
3,000
times dirtier than fuel burned in US and European diesel trucks. Can
anything be
done? 'Green Ship Technology' is being developed below the radar, especially
in
Denmark - but what about paradigm shifts in ship propulsion? One floating
test-bed could be Soliloquy, the world's first carbon-neutral super-yacht.
Fixed
sails will double as solar panels to produce enough energy to propel the
58-metre-long boat at a cruising speed of eight knots, and the hull will be
made
of sustainable timber instead of the usual more energy-intensive aluminium.
At fifty million euros, the design is pitched at the high end of the weekend
boating market, it's true - and there's a bit of a gap between eco
super-yachts
and vast freight ships. But Callender says the latter &quot;is an area of design
that
I would like to get involved with, given the chance&quot;..

MUSEUMS OF SOCIAL HOO-HAH
What should design museums do, or be? Your correspondent joined a group of
writers and curators to discuss 'Reasons Not to Be Pretty: Symposium on
Design,
Social Change and the Museum'. We discussed the notion of design for social
change, its various forms and manifestations, and how best to exhibit,
acquire,
and preserve its artifacts in museum and non-museum contexts. Julie Lasky
wittily shortened this long menu to 'social hoo-hah'. Our group discussed
some
intriguing possibilities. First, there's a need for shared public spaces
that
are integrational of ideas and people separated by modernity and
rationalism.
Second, platforms are needed for diverse ecologies of ecology of actors to
engage with so-called wicked problems; could museums be this platform?
Third, we
all need time to think and reflect, and the museum could be the right place
to
do this. And fourth, the Hindi word for museum is &quot;house of magic&quot;. On
reflection, there's a difference between what we might want a museum to be -
and
what it is now, or is likely to become. Perhaps we should let museums be
musems,
and leave them alone to do what they do best: collect, preserve, and present
artefacts. The event was produced by Winterhouse, with support from the
Rockefeller Foundation (at whose pad, Bellagio, we stayed).

'Rurality 2.0', engages with technology, tradition and rural landscapes. It
will
take place in the area of the Ducal Castle in Bisaccia, a little village of
the
Alta Irpinia. One of the most striking rural area of the entire South of
Italy,
it's 'enriched by landscapes full of abstract, wind and infiniteness,
steeples,
towers, narrow and quiet streets, place of an historical metabolism that is
slow
and almost solemn in its ancestral rituals'.
