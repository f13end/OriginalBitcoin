<PRE>one of my priorities, I have planned this for july 5 to 9, is to jot down
notes on the partner state,

in the meantime, are you interested that I send some of our political
linkages?

see already, <A HREF="http://del.icio.us/mbauwens/P2P-State-Approaches,">http://del.icio.us/mbauwens/P2P-State-Approaches,</A> and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;Blond and Bauwens do not lack academic or other credentials, but their

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political, even theological and spiritual, than I normally see in searching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for future speculations that bear on TIMN. This too makes them interesting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to review together, as a change of pace. Each in his own way, Blond and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bauwens seek to surmount old distinctions about state vs. market, public vs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new philosophizing about the state on the Right or the Left, but I sense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they are indicative.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because of the heavy travel schedule last spring, I hardly have had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time to follow my favorite blogs, and to my great shame I did not update my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> readings of David Ronfeldt&#8217;s blog.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He has not been sitting still, so here is a review of not too miss blog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) David is continuing his investigations into the continuation of tribal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forms:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * A propos the definition of tribes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Tribes vis a vis other governance forms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) David is starting to review recent state theories, 1) Bobbitt&#8217;s Market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> State; 2) Blond&#8217;s Civic State and 3) planned but not written yet, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion of my own concept of a Partner State (inspired by Cosma Orsi&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Political Economy of Reciprocity)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;In the looming age of networks &#8212; assuming civil society is strengthened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the framework forecasts, or that a new network-based realm emerges from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it &#8212; a new model of the state will emerge that may be relatively leaner, yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> draws new strength from enhanced abilities to act in concert with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> civil-society actors. . . . It is not clear what actors may comprise a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network-based sector or realm, but the TIMN framework implies that many will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be non-profit, socially-minded NGOs. As noted earlier, some activities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently associated with the public or private sectors are already being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redesigned into multiorganizational networks &#8212; notably in the areas of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> health, education, and welfare &#8212; and these seem likely candidates to migrate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the new realm.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few excerpts to give you a taste of David&#8217;s approach:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.1. David Ronfeldt&#8217;s critique of the Market State concept:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;My concern is Bobbitt&#8217;s &#8220;market state&#8221; concept, starting with its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definition and timeline. (Note: Unless otherwise indicated, the quotations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and page references from Bobbitt&#8217;s book are probably from Ogilvy&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have yet to spot a full, single definition of the market state. But to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> judge from scattered elements, it is about states becoming shaped more by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global market forces &#8212; by globalization &#8212; than by national forces of all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds. It is also about governments redesigning themselves to rely on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market-oriented measures: e.g., decentralization, deregulation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privatization, outsourcing, subcontracting. Moreover, Bobbitt claims that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;the market state exists to maximize the opportunities enjoyed by all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members of society&#8221; ( p. 229). It is &#8220;above all, a mechanism for enhancing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity, for creating something &#8212; possibilities &#8212; commensurate with our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagination&#8221; (p. 232). That purpose, in Bobbitt&#8217;s view, is its hallmark,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making the market state philosophically and strategically distinct from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> earlier varieties of the state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to timeline, Bobbitt treats the market state as something quite new. He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dates its appearance from 1989, and foresees that the &#8220;transition to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market-state is bound to last over a long period&#8221; (p. 233). At present, &#8220;the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market-state has not fully emerged or been fully realized and accepted by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any society&#8221; (p. 335). Indeed, he reiterates in an interview, &#8220;We are only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just a few of years down the road to what will be a many decades long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process, but you can already see signs of this happening.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet, what seems mostly new to me in all of this is Bobbitt&#8217;s novel name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the phenomenon. In substance, it is not much different from what Richard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rosecrance earlier termed the &#8220;trading state&#8221; (1986) and the &#8220;virtual state&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (1999). More to the point, I&#8217;d say, its emergence began in the early 1970s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when &#8220;transnational interdependence&#8221; began to gain notice in writings about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rise of multinational corporations and other nonstate actors, the fusing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of domestic and international matters, the globalization of commerce and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communications, and hence the growth of new constraints on the traditions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sovereignty and territoriality. (See writings by a host of theorists back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then, notably Robert Keohane, Joseph Nye, and James Rosenau).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus, it is inaccurate for Bobbitt to go on to argue, as he does in his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next book, that developments like these &#8220;are outside the frame of reference
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the popular theories of international relations that circulated at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end of the 20th century&#8221; (pp. 30-31). Many of the trends he emphasizes had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been noticed for decades and took hold during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presidencies in the 1980s-1990s. Even the individualist,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity-maximizing goal that Bobbitt stresses reflects the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libertarianism that has coursed so strongly the past decade or two. And it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not at all clear that other market states elsewhere will be so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libertarian &#8212; possibly quite the contrary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, insofar as the United States is concerned, Bobbitt&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept is far more a reflection of the present than a portent of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future, and it&#8217;s been developing decades longer than his analysis conveys.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may be true that the nature of the market state is still unfolding in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> United States, and that it has barely taken hold elsewhere around the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it may also turn out that the recent U.S. version proves more an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception than a rule, more ephemeral than enduring.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus, my TIMN angle is that, much as I&#8217;m impressed by Bobbitt&#8217;s coinage of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;market state&#8221; as a term, it may turn out to say more about the American
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> present than the world&#8217;s future, and it began to emerge decades earlier than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he argues. The term does illuminate the exalted (overweening?) influence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that global market forces exert over states these days. It also reflects the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rising importance of outsourcing, subcontracting, and other market-oriented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measures &#8212; sometimes called &#8220;government by market&#8221; (or acidly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;market-mimicking governance&#8221;) &#8212; as options for government policies and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programs. That is useful and revelatory; it means the concept helps focus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people&#8217;s perceptions on how powerful and pervasive market forces have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become. But are we thereby opening our eyes to the beginning or the end of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long trend?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#8217;s recall that the +M form began to spread centuries ago, and that its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> principles long ago filtered into and altered the nature of states, enabling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rise of increasingly open competitive political systems. That helps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account for Europe&#8217;s evolution from the absolutist state to the liberal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic (or parliamentary) state &#8212; in other words, from a state devoted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to hierarchical (+I) doctrines, to a state whose electoral, party, and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structures also rested in part on market-like (+M) political principles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From a TIMN perspective, then, the market state actually has a long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history. It overlaps with the nation state and does not represent a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> departure from it as Bobbitt claims. Indeed, the world&#8217;s major liberal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracies &#8212;nation states all &#8212; have amounted to early market states for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over a century. What Bobbitt has illuminated is the late market state &#8212; its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overwrought aging, not its youthful rise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If Bobbitt&#8217;s &#8220;market state&#8221; is better viewed as the &#8220;late market state&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arising a century or so after the &#8220;early market state,&#8221; then its rise is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occurring on the eve of the next major form: the network (+N). And that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggests a new proposition about TIMN dynamics. I&#8217;m not sure, but perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absolutism in the Middle Ages may be viewed not only as a pinnacle of the +I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchical form, but also as its overwrought exaltation, again on the eve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the rise of a next major form: in that era, the market (+M). Perhaps &#8212;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and here&#8217;s the proposition (phrasing tentative) &#8212; the late aging of one form
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may interact with the germinal stirrings of the next in a way that leads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing regimes to overemphasize the aging form, partly to defend against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rise of the germinal form that those regimes are just beginning to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, the details of Bobbitt&#8217;s analysis &#8212; the trends he stresses, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms he uses &#8212; are often as much or more about the +N form than the +M
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> form. He has confounded and conflated the market (+M) form with what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really new and next: the rise of the network (+N) form. A system of late
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market states is emerging, but so too are the outlines of what will in time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supersede the market state: something akin to a network (or nexus) state.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is &#8220;Red Tory&#8221; Phillip Blond&#8217;s critique of the market state (he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> himself advocates a civic state)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.2 Phillip Blond critique&#8217;s of the market state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;We know what is right and what is wrong with the market state. Clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the market is a more effective and efficient mechanism for the distribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of many resources than the state. Evidently if one can enter the market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place and if one has something to trade &#8211; the market creates wealth,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prosperity and independence. Finally there is the manifest good of liberty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and unless this has an economic reality &#8211; one would exist under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permanent subjugation of the state, or the private cartel. Yet we also know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is wrong with the market state &#8211; too often it replaces a public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monopoly with a private cartel. In the name of breaking up the state too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little attempt was applied to breaking up the market. Under the dispensation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the market state, private replaced public monopoly and market entry was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively and progressively denied to newcomers. The majority of Britons
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having being denied entry to the market lost any access to investment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capital. Thus the ability to transform one&#8217;s life or situation steadily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declined as wealth flowed upwards rather than downwards and a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oligarchical class, asset rich and leverage keen, assumed market freedom was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synonymous with their complete ascendancy. Market fundamentalism abandoned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fundamentals of markets. Prudent Chancellors promised no more boom and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bust, the state sanctioned monopoly capitalism and sat happy on the tax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receipts of unrestrained global gambling. As Labour stoked the engine of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inequality &#8211; it abandoned the rest of the economy for the receipts of city
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speculation and the re-distributive power of welfarism . Thus the market and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the welfare state merged into one as they both colluded in a system whose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bankruptcy is now ongoing and self-evident.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The welfare state and the market state are now two defunct and mutually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supporting failures. The real merit of the current conservative renaissance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has in some way escaped notice. Those on the now bankrupt left argue that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new Toryism is but a cover for Thatcherism Mark II, while those on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bankrupt right secretly agree and seem to want nothing more than a return to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monopoly capitalism and the dominance of their kind of people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modern conservatism rejects both dispensations as it seeks to replace the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> welfare and the market state with the Civic State.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> David Ronfeldt then looks at Blond&#8217;s advocacy of a civic state:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.3 David Ronfeldt on the civic state:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;Blond is quite sketchy about the civic state. But it&#8217;s clear he means a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized, distributist state of limited scope. Indeed, he also calls it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the civil state, the associative state, the mutualized state, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ownership state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> According to Blond, the civic state will restore people&#8217;s participation in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;the common good&#8221; by re-enabling &#8220;the associative drive&#8221; that liberalism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stifled. Thus it will be a state that &#8220;privileges the associative above the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alienated, the responsible over the self-serving and . . . the communal over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the individual.&#8221; It will express a &#8220;radical communitarian civic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conservatism&#8221; &#8212; his &#8220;red Toryism&#8221; concept &#8212; that can &#8220;inveigh with equal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vigour against public monopolies of state and giant cartels of the market&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not just high-sounding rhetoric, for he makes clear the direction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he wants the state to go in:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;In the political realm, we have to admit that democracy doesn&#8217;t work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particularly well, mainly because it&#8217;s hugely centralized and substantially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> captured by vested interests. We need to turn it upside-down &#8212; a doctrine of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> radical democratic subsidiarity that would allow local associations both to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> select and vote for their own candidates. We can&#8217;t do that in the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political settlement. It&#8217;s too locked; there are too many vested interests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if, like budgetary capture, we had a democratic capture, we could send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy back to the streets. If we could ally that political economy with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual democracy, we could really have bottom-up associations and render the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> central state increasingly superfluous.&#8221; (source; my italics)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;The new civil state would restore what the welfare state has destroyed &#8212;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> human association. This new civil state will turn itself over to its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> citizens; it will foster the power of association and allow its citizens to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take it over rather as it had originally taken over them. . . . So conceived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the monolithic state could gradually be broken down into an associative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state where citizens took over and ran their own services . . . .&#8221; (source;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my italics)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus, Blond proposes that the &#8220;public sector should be broken up &#8212; not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privatized out&#8221; &#8212; and many of its services transferred to civil-society
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actors apart from the existing public and private sectors. That appears to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be his main point about the civic state; it is mainly &#8220;a facilitator&#8221; in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this associative scheme. The state is still a parliamentary democracy atop a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> party system; but its bureaucracy is smaller, and its orientation to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economy and civil society has been redefined and restructured.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He links this to ideas for a &#8220;re-moralized market&#8221; &#8212; a &#8220;whole new model of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social capitalism&#8221; based on a &#8220;civic economy&#8221; &#8212; that would benefit small and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> medium businesses and be less fraught by government bureaucracies and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporate cartels. However, I&#8217;m going to skip over that, and head into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what&#8217;s far more significant for my sense of TIMN: Blond&#8217;s proposals for new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds of civil-society associations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blond&#8217;s vision is about creating the civic state. But to make that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feasible, his vision is even more about re-energizing civil society &#8212; so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much so that local civil associations get to assume functions long performed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It envisages the rise of a &#8220;social economy&#8221; based on a &#8220;new localism&#8221;. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it&#8217;s loaded with lingo about public service businesses, social businesses,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social enterprises, civil companies, and civic companies. I&#8217;m not exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure what such terms mean, but the aim is clear: a bottom-up system for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;citizen groups to take over government budgets and run them for themselves&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (source). Blond favors worker buy-outs, employee-owned coops, and local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> investment trusts, where employees and other locals get to share in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ownership, and profit is not the key purpose. His emphasis is on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delivery of public services, but he also proposes reforms to banking. It&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all very much about mutualism and distributism, in conservative senses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What Blond lays out is consistent with what I think TIMN may imply for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future: a more delimited but also stronger kind of state (a &#8220;nexus state&#8221;),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> along with the rise of a new networked social sector. What&#8217;s missing from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blond&#8217;s vision is a connection to the network (+N) form. The Ownership State
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (2010) mentions that the &#8220;baseline requirements&#8221; for his proposals include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;open systems&#8221; in which &#8220;hierarchies give way to networks&#8221; (p. 11). It also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommends &#8220;a flatter management structure in the public sector&#8221; . . .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;where peer-to-peer motivation builds ethos and expertise and replaces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vertical sanction&#8221; (p. 34). But so far these points are made only in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passing; they deserve elaboration.&#8221;
