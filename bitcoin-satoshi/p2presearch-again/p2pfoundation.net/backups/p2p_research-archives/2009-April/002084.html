</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear Kevin, and others,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this seems a remarkable collection of material, see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/">http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if anyone has time to go through it and report on it for the blog, it
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be much appreciated,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you say, it's a remarkable collection of material.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've only had time to look through the titles that caught my eye as
</I>&gt;<i> related to my own areas of interest:  mainly LETS systems and
</I>&gt;<i> relocalized economies.  The following passages seem particularly
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to my primary current interest in informal and household
</I>&gt;<i> economies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  From &quot;We Need More Than LETS&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/localcurrency.html">http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/localcurrency.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt;LETS members soon find that they can only meet a small
</I>&gt;<i> proportion of their needs through LETS, i.e., that there is not that
</I>&gt;<i> much they can buy with their LETS credits, and not that much they can
</I>&gt;<i> produce and sell. Every day they need many basic goods and services
</I>&gt;<i> but very few of these are offered by members of the system. This is
</I>&gt;<i> the central problem in local economic renewal; the need for ways of
</I>&gt;<i> increasing the capacity of local people to produce things local people
</I>&gt;<i> need. The core problem in other words is how to set up viable
</I>&gt;<i> firms....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The core task in town economic renewal is to enable, indeed create a
</I>&gt;<i> whole new sector of economic activity involving the people who were
</I>&gt;<i> previously excluded from producing and earning and purchasing. This
</I>&gt;<i> requires much more than just providing the necessary money; it
</I>&gt;<i> requires the establishment of firms in which people a can produce and
</I>&gt;<i> earn .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  From &quot;Local Currencies&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/localcurrency.html">http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/localcurrency.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt;However the problem is that most people do not have much
</I>&gt;<i> they can sell, i.e., they do not have many productive skills or the
</I>&gt;<i> capital to set up a firm....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is obvious here that what matters in local economic renewal is not
</I>&gt;<i> redistribution of income or purchasing power.  What matters is
</I>&gt;<i> redistribution of production power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MY COMMENT:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although Trainer mentions such new industries as community bakeries as
</I>&gt;<i> a way of putting productive power in the hands of the presently
</I>&gt;<i> unemployed, it strikes me that the underutilized capacity of ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> capital goods that most households already own is the single greatest
</I>&gt;<i> untapped resource.  There's already a (largely idle) &quot;community
</I>&gt;<i> bakery&quot; in existence, consisting of all the ordinary kitchen ovens
</I>&gt;<i> possessed even by most poor and unemployed people, which they
</I>&gt;<i> currently might use once or twice a week or less.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people could be put to work using such household capital equipment
</I>&gt;<i> to full capacity, and exchanging directly with each other, the meeting
</I>&gt;<i> of a major portion of consumption needs might be shifted from the
</I>&gt;<i> wage-and-commodity economy to the informal and household sector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things standing in the way of such a development is the
</I>&gt;<i> zoning, occupational licensing, and local &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;health&quot; codes
</I>&gt;<i> that criminalize low-overhead, small-batch production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example:  a microbakery using an ordinary household oven could
</I>&gt;<i> produce high-quality bread, for exchanging for a neighbor's surplus
</I>&gt;<i> tomatoes, or for clothing produced by the best seamstress in the
</I>&gt;<i> neighborhood using her ordinary sewing machine, or for replacement
</I>&gt;<i> parts for a malfunctioning appliance custom-machined by a hobbyist
</I>&gt;<i> with a well-equipped but underutilized backyard metal workshop, or for
</I>&gt;<i> rides with an unlicensed cab service consisting only of a family car
</I>&gt;<i> and cell phone, or for daycare by one of the neighbors--all of them
</I>&gt;<i> networked together through a barter system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the local regulatory system mandates an industrial-sized oven,
</I>&gt;<i> fridge and dishwasher, and often expensive licensing, which imposes
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory minimum levels of overhead so that the only way to service
</I>&gt;<i> the overhead cost is to work full-time as a baker, with the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> going bankrupt if the business fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The CPSIA legislation, which mandates expensive testing of each
</I>&gt;<i> separate line of clothing, criminalizes small-scale apparel
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturers who design many clothing lines and then just produce
</I>&gt;<i> each one to demand on a lean basis, because the only way to amortize
</I>&gt;<i> the testing cost is to produce a given design in large batches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a national scale, &quot;intellectual property&quot; [sic] laws protect the
</I>&gt;<i> old corporate dinosaurs from competition by small producers in the
</I>&gt;<i> music, publishing and software fields, using only the cheap production
</I>&gt;<i> equipment made possible by the desktop revolution, and thus enable the
</I>&gt;<i> corporate dinosaurs to pursue a business model in which most commodity
</I>&gt;<i> price consists on oligopoly markup or rents on artificial property
</I>&gt;<i> rather than actual labor and materials cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IP law also restricts the competing production of replacement parts
</I>&gt;<i> for other companies' proprietary designs, and the consequent
</I>&gt;<i> development of modular product design with competing production of
</I>&gt;<i> features and accessories for other design platforms, or competing
</I>&gt;<i> product designs around a common basic platform.  This creates a legal
</I>&gt;<i> barrier to product design for easy repair and recycling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seventy years ago, Ralph Borsodi pointed out that electrical power put
</I>&gt;<i> household production on a superior footing to the factory, when the
</I>&gt;<i> latter's costs of distribution and marketing were factored in.  Since
</I>&gt;<i> then, we've had a quantum leap in the capabilities of household
</I>&gt;<i> appliances for milling, preserving, sewing, woodwork, etc.  The
</I>&gt;<i> desktop revolution has reduced the minimum capital outlays for
</I>&gt;<i> publishing, music, etc., from hundreds of thousands of dollars to at
</I>&gt;<i> most a few thousand.  And where larger capital outlays are still
</I>&gt;<i> needed, crowdsourcing and other forms of network finance have
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated the need for a capitalist banking system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Borsodi's main shortcoming was in failing to recognize an intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> scale between household production and the capitalist economy.  He
</I>&gt;<i> argued that the individual homestead should substitute home production
</I>&gt;<i> for purchase with wages whenever it created a net efficiency, but
</I>&gt;<i> avoid producing a surplus for exchange, because one could only
</I>&gt;<i> exchange a surplus on disadvantageous terms in a capitalist market.
</I>&gt;<i> He neglected to consider the possibility of direct exchange of
</I>&gt;<i> surpluses with other producers in a NON-capitalist market, via small
</I>&gt;<i> barter networks.  As a result, the system of household autarky he
</I>&gt;<i> advocated resulted in each household having to duplicate most basic
</I>&gt;<i> capital equipment, with much of it remaining idle most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, a small-scale barter system would remove the
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary duplication and enable capital equipment to be utilized to
</I>&gt;<i> full capacity (i.e., the neighborhood seamstress doing most of the
</I>&gt;<i> sewing for the neighborhood and using her sewing machine to full
</I>&gt;<i> capacity--rather than every household, even those with mediocre sewing
</I>&gt;<i> skills, having its own sewing machine).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mass production model, with its capital intensive,
</I>&gt;<i> product-specific machinery, results in an economy drowning in overhead
</I>&gt;<i> costs.  The planned obsolescence and push distribution it mandates
</I>&gt;<i> results in mountains of crystallized labor wasted in the landfills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, informal and household production, relying on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spare cycles&quot; or &quot;idle capacity&quot; of existing capital goods, makes the
</I>&gt;<i> informal economy potentially an order of magnitude more efficient.
</I>&gt;<i> It's an illustration of Buckminster Fuller's principles of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ephemeralization&quot; and &quot;doing more with less.&quot;  It's much like the
</I>&gt;<i> rats in the dinosaurs' nests sixty million years ago, preparing to eat
</I>&gt;<i> them alive.  As John Robb says of his Resilient Communities, it offers
</I>&gt;<i> an order-of-magnitude &quot;STEMI compression&quot; over the system it's
</I>&gt;<i> supplanting:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/11/stemi.html">http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/11/stemi.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt;In the evolution of technology, the next generation of a
</I>&gt;<i> particular device/program often follows a well known pattern in the
</I>&gt;<i> marketplace: its design makes it MUCH cheaper, faster, and more
</I>&gt;<i> capable. This allows it to crowd out the former technology and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually dominate the market (i.e. transistors replacing vacuum
</I>&gt;<i> tubes in computation). A formalization of this developmental process
</I>&gt;<i> is known as STEMI compression:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Space. Less volume/area used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Time. Faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Energy. Less energy. Higher efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Mass. Less waste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Information. Higher efficiency. Less management overhead....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...[I]s the Resilient Community concept (as envisioned here) a viable
</I>&gt;<i> self-organizing system that can rapidly and virally crowd out existing
</I>&gt;<i> structures due to its systemic improvements? Using STEMI compression
</I>&gt;<i> as a measure, there is reason to believe it is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Space. Localization (or hyperlocalization) radically reduces the
</I>&gt;<i> space needed to support any given unit of human activity. Turns
</I>&gt;<i> useless space (residential, etc.) into productive space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Time. Wasted time in global transport is washed away. JIT (just in
</I>&gt;<i> time production) and place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Energy. Wasted energy for global transport is eliminated. Energy
</I>&gt;<i> production is tied to locality of use. More efficient use of solar
</I>&gt;<i> energy (the only true exogenous energy input to our global system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Mass. Less systemic wastage. Made to order vs. made for market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Information. Radical simplification. Replaces hideously complex
</I>&gt;<i> global management overhead with simple local management
</I>&gt;<i> systems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the regulatory regime was created of, by and for the
</I>&gt;<i> corporate dinosaurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the chief strategies for a local economy should be to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate networking of such household producers for mutual exchange,
</I>&gt;<i> and to run interference against the regulatory barriers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  In &quot;Thoughts on the Transition to a Sustainable Society,&quot; Trainer
</I>&gt;<i> advocates community gardens and workshops.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/18-Transition.html">http://ssis.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/18-Transition.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a common theme throughout the alternative economic literature:
</I>&gt;<i>  Karl Hess, Keith Paton, Colin Ward, and Kirkpatrick Sale, among
</I>&gt;<i> others.  The most recent and promising incarnation of the idea was
</I>&gt;<i> Nathan Cravens' &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; idea
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.appropedia.org/The_Triple_Alliance">http://www.appropedia.org/The_Triple_Alliance</A>&gt;, which was piggybacked
</I>&gt;<i> on Dougald Hine's sketch here:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://otherexcuses.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-media-vs-recession.html">http://otherexcuses.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-media-vs-recession.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>  The one thing that's missing from the Triple Alliance IMO, that
</I>&gt;<i> belongs alongside the Fab Lab and Community-Supported Agriculture as
</I>&gt;<i> equal in importance, is cheap social housing. This might be done via
</I>&gt;<i> cohousing set up as an OS community version of the YMCA, located in a
</I>&gt;<i> barebones warehouse-style space of some kind with things like a cot,
</I>&gt;<i> plus access to water tap, toilet, and hotplate provided at cost and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps subsidized by contributions. Or it might simply replicate the
</I>&gt;<i> immigrant model of several families sharing one house, with some sort
</I>&gt;<i> of network arrangement for hooking individuals up with openings.
