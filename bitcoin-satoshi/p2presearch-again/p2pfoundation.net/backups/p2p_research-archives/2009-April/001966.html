<PRE>Oops, sent to sender not list...
Trying again:

Hi again,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The state mobilisation through social movements, again was typical of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;high&quot; Stalinism and Nazism, but not so much of the &quot;post-totalitarian&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> regimes; what the latter have (and the former also) is mobilisation through
</I>&gt;<i> incorporated agencies and services, which I think is paralleled in &quot;Third
</I>&gt;<i> Way&quot; uses of ex-welfare-state agencies, private partnerships and quangos
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. purging teachers and replacing them with Blairite clones).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Corporations and governments have been around for a long time, but until
</I>&gt;<i> quite recently have never been dominant in the SOCIAL space (as distinct
</I>&gt;<i> from claiming such dominance in law), because there are usually dense webs
</I>&gt;<i> of social networks and movements which are more horizontal (c.f. Colin
</I>&gt;<i> Ward's work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also Marc's point &quot;The governments that we have today are just a kind of
</I>&gt;<i> business entity that gets to operate above both the domestic and
</I>&gt;<i> international law&quot;, seems to me to be saying a little more than just
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;governments and corporations are dominant and dysfunctional&quot; - he's saying
</I>&gt;<i> firstly that governments are now defined on the corporate model, and
</I>&gt;<i> secondly that these corporate governments are (or try to be) above the law,
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, above all laws (I would extend, above all constraints whether legal,
</I>&gt;<i> customary, relational, ideological or material).  It is here that they would
</I>&gt;<i> take on totalitarian or extreme authoritarian attributes.  Neither the
</I>&gt;<i> Keynesian state nor the classical authoritarian (Establishment) state would
</I>&gt;<i> either model itself on a corporation or claim/aspire to be above all laws.
</I>&gt;<i> The classic authoritarian state would be constrained by the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> Establishment (extra-state, extra-corporate elites) and had to operate
</I>&gt;<i> within limits set by the latter and enshrined in its laws, while the
</I>&gt;<i> Keynesian state was more of an arbitration than a corporate role, and had to
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee its trustworthiness with predictability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marc is reminding me a lot of Negri's early (autonomist) stuff where he
</I>&gt;<i> views the boundary between state and capital disappearing entirely, the
</I>&gt;<i> state becoming an unmediated part or agent of capital and the disappearance
</I>&gt;<i> of mediations leading to a replacement of foundation on externality (the law
</I>&gt;<i> of value) with the arbitrariness of command.  Negri also uses the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;totalitarian&quot; for this regime, while insisting on its sharp differentiation
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;fascism&quot; specifically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where does competency fit in? - well, I think Ryan and Marc are right that
</I>&gt;<i> creative vitality is only possible in networks, that hierarchies are
</I>&gt;<i> ineffective, almost a kind of social death in terms of vital energies
</I>&gt;<i> (Kropotkin already theorised this when he discussed the rise and fall of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;civilisations&quot;).  This is ultimately what finished off the Soviet Union and
</I>&gt;<i> its satellites - it could implement the technologies of its day, but it
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't achieve anything very effectively, the system was too rigid, and it
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't keep up with the flows elsewhere, let alone compete in releasing
</I>&gt;<i> its own flows.  Capitalism in contrast was able at this point to draw to
</I>&gt;<i> some extent on flows, even while exploiting them.  But the closure of
</I>&gt;<i> certain regimes today, seems to reproduce the problems of the Soviet model.
</I>&gt;<i> Which would suggest that, assuming there isn't a social transformation
</I>&gt;<i> first, there will be a process of long, slow decline ending in collapse.
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose for instance that file sharing and infinite reproducibility of data
</I>&gt;<i> are shut down or held back in these regimes, while flourishing elsewhere
</I>&gt;<i> where controls don't exist or are harder to enforce.  But there's a problem
</I>&gt;<i> that it's a delayed effect - it isn't visible yet, because countries like
</I>&gt;<i> Britain can keep living off past accumulation and remain &quot;richer&quot;, more
</I>&gt;<i> popular as targets of migration, etc.  And another problem that the
</I>&gt;<i> up-and-coming regimes seem to be adopting the same model.
</I>&gt;<i>
