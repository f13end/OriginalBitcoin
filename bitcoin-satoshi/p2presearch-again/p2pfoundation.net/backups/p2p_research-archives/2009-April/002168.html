<PRE>HI Darren,

Sounds like a good initiative, i.e. to work out the implications of what it
would ethically mean to live sustainably, and how social actors could
respond to that. In my view, it's when this also becomes part of policy
making, as well as a general ethical expectation that real change would
occur. But it is a necessary initial step.

I copy some of the people who may be interested in adding their views, and
have put the proposal as a textfile below,

Once it gets out of the proposal stage, I would be happy to report it in
our blog,

Michel

Hi Michel,

I recently met with Alex Fearnside - the team leader for sustainability at
City of Melbourne.

He's got a great idea about how to catalyse behaviour change when it comes
to the environment, sustainability and the climate crisis and we're thinking
of getting a few individuals and groups together to brainstorm the idea and
then launch it collaboratively.

Attached is the brief for what is currently called 'Future Code', but will
likely be renamed (Word doc).
Keen to hear your thoughts.
Please pass along to people who you think might be interested in
contributing to the idea.

Regards,
Darren

Future Code Project &#8211; Basic Business Case

The purpose of this document is to outline a simple business case for this
project.
Context

This project is based on the following[1] &lt;#_ftn1&gt;:

   1. Action on climate change is needed NOW. This is backed up by reports
   from key scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and
   reported frequently in the media.
   2. Without immediate and concerted action from all sectors of society,
   Australian&#8217;s and our civilisation will be significantly impacted by climate
   changes in the next 10 to 20 years. This will occur in most of our own
   lifetimes, not just out children or grand children&#8217;s lifetimes.
   3. People from all sectors of society are ready and willing to take the
   necessary action, we just haven&#8217;t started yet &#8211; we are waiting for someone
   else to lead and do the hard work for us.



Solutions that have worked to avert other environmental and social issues
have yet to work with climate change. A quote from Einstein illustrates why:
&#8220;No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created
it.&#8221;



A second quote, this time from the United Kingdom&#8217;s Sustainable Development
Commission, illustrates the role of leadership and hints at what maybe
needed to succeed in this challenge:

Changing the habits of a lifetime is not easy for any of us. But public
commitment can be harnessed by positive leadership that delivers a
compelling vision for change and makes that change possible. People need to
feel confident that their own efforts are part of a collective effort,
supported by policies that make sustainable choices the easier choice.
[2]&lt;#_ftn2&gt;



In Australia there is currently a wide range of climate change activities &#8211;
from political advocacy to business lead solutions to community action.
None, so far, have generated the necessary leadership and action to
transition to a prosperous and low carbon future.



A final quote, again from Einstein illustrates the futility of not changing
our current approach to solving the climate crisis: &#8220;Insanity: doing the
same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221;



The Future Code Project aims to generate the necessary leadership and action
for Australia&#8217;s and Melbourne&#8217;s rapid transition to a prosperous, low-carbon
future.
The Project

*Purpose*

&#183;          To generate a community lead code-of-ethics for individuals to
facilitate the transition to a low-carbon Australia and Melbourne. Two
examples of codes-of-ethics are at the end of this document.

&#183;          To have politicians and their staff, CEOs, and the wider
community commit to this and use it to guide decisions and actions.



*Principles*

&#183;          To lead through doing &#8211; less talk, more action.

&#183;          To be open, inclusive and empowering.

&#183;          To be innovative and non partisan in any approach developed.



*Process*

It is proposed the project be undertaken in two phases. The initial phase is
the creation of the code, which would be lead by a small group of
individuals, would utilise Web 2.0 functionality, and involve a wide range
of individual contributions.



The second phase would involve the promotion of the code, its adoption, and
monitoring and reviewing its progress.
What does success look like?

&#183;          The code-of-ethics is simple, memorable and appeals to the
mainstream.

&#183;          This project catalyses / foster leadership at all levels of
society.



To achieve this, contributors will need to have &#8216;skin in the game&#8217; &#8211; we have
to want this project to succeed.
Next steps

An initial 90 minute meeting with a small group of potential contributors to
discuss and further develop the project. This meeting should happen in late
April, early May and will be organised by Alex Fearnside.
