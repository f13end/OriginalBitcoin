<PRE>Hi Michel,
this is an excerpt from the blurb.
The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus. 
To participate in the conversation we would have to produce a short abstract within the next couple of week, and then see what happens.
As this is a forum and not an academic conference, there is no need to write an academic paper. Those interested in collaborating could be more imaginative I suppose.
Andreas

	Hi Andreas,
	
	I'm also not sure what kind of cooperation you are thinking of. Such establsihed outfits are rarely interested in going on board with smaller outfits, unless you would have relations with their leadership?
	
	The P2PRG might be interested in creating a edu subgroup focused on p2p learning? (with people such as tere)
	
	Ryan: though I share your approach, I don't think we can control social processes, and so far it does seem history has not  evolved as softly and 'linearly' as we would wish ..
	
	Here's an interesting view of change dynamics related to Obama, from <A HREF="http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=f889d9db-8e99-4eef-a138-5dfec44c6843">http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=f889d9db-8e99-4eef-a138-5dfec44c6843</A>
	
	I find this summary of radical reform, partial reaction, and renewed reform on a higher level of attainment, to be quite compelling,
	
	excerpt:
	
	&quot;
	

	Americans have been notoriously loath to undertake reforms that increase the role of government. That goes back partly to our Lockean liberal heritage of minimal government that marks us off from Europe with its absolutist past. The only times that Americans have permitted major changes in government's role have been during economic crises, social upheavals, and war--that is to say, during the Civil War, the Progressive Era and World War I, the New Deal and World War II, and the Sixties (circa 1961-1974). If you look at these periods, and at the intervals between them, you find certain patterns that may help explain what is going on today.

	

		Reform and reaction: Periods of major reform have invariably been followed by periods of reaction: the Civil War by the era of Robber Barons and Social Darwinism; the Progressive Era and World War I by the Twenties of Calvin Coolidge and Andrew Mellon; the New Deal and World War II by the Robert Taft Congresses and the Eisenhower presidency; and the Sixties by Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich, and George W. Bush.

	

		The limits of reaction: In these periods of reaction, attempts were made to undo and reverse prior reforms, but the efforts always fell short, and the reforms were preserved, if in weakened form. The Robert Taft Congresses failed to eliminate collective bargaining; Eisenhower, to the distress of conservative GOPers, kept social security in place; Reagan, Gingrich, and G. W. Bush tried, but failed, to eliminate the regulatory reforms of the Sixties. In addition, during these periods of reaction, the government's share in the gross domestic product never fell below the plateau established, except during the world wars, by the prior reform era.

	

	Reform builds on reform: Each of the reform eras picked up on the unfinished agenda of the prior era, and in some respects, went beyond it and into uncharted waters. The New Deal nationalized the state reforms of the Progressive Era (such as unemployment compensation), but also radically expanded the sheer quantitative role of government in the economy. The Sixties expanded social security and added Medicare and Medicaid, but it also radically widened the definition of what government could do to include things like worker safety and environmental protection (which is different from Progressive Era conservation)&quot;

		What should be nurtured?  Let's say the normative framework of universities is relatively set.  That means change will have to be organic, social and part of long historical evolution of the model, if it is to come from inside.  So, if the way to achieve a transformation in such an ecology is through nurturing new values as hybrid contributions, the question that should be asked is, what shold be nurtured?
		
		That is, there will not be a rupture, revolution (a la the Reformation) and then an inevitable counter-revolution.  The NYTimes article today invoked Luther's 95 theses.  Maybe that means there will now be Jesuits and an Inquisition.  That's not the way.  We need a velvet revolution...a grafting of a new form of apple tree onto the old stock and vine.  
		
		P2P could be a cogent set of ideas worth investigating in comparison to current university ideals.  Maybe a worthwhile approach would be to discuss what sorts of hybrids between p2p and current academic approaches might be worth fertilizing.
		
		I appreciate the feeling that iconoclasm will not be well received in such environments.

			I don't have any clear ideas, lets see where the conversation will take us. There is only one thing where my mind is already set. I'm not interested in a condemning critique of the current situation, as this has been raised often enough and we could only be repetitive.
			I am inspired by the George Siemens blog <A HREF="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/">http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/</A>&gt;
			that Ryan send a few day ago, particularly by the last sentence:
			&quot;We know what we don't want universities to be. We don't yet have thought leadership on what they should become.&quot;
			That is what I'd like to think about.
			A.

			       Dear Andreas
			       Thanks for sharing
			       a few of us on this list already work in universities, and work with innovation
			       I think the term 'third world' has been replaced with 'developing countries; which is preferred term, in fact that is out of date, and we use emerging economies instead, or some other euphemism
			
			       the next question is why would a developing country forum would be held in switzerland? (as much as I love the country)
			       would it not make sense to have it in a developing country
			       (or does it coincide with the economic forum?)
			
			       other than that, it could be interesting, would be nice to know what kind fo collaboration you are thinking of
			
			       cheers

			              THIRD WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM
			              Davos, Switzerland
			              9-11 January 2010
			
			
			              <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com</A>&gt;
			


			              Inspired partly by the success of World Economic Forum in hosting global conversations about emerging issues of economic policy, the World Universities Forum (WUF) was created in 2008 in the belief that academe must better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus. While WUF encourages conversations about all aspects of higher education policy and practice, the keynotes for the third WUF have been invited to consider issues of the current global economic crisis and its implications for universities.
			
			              Keynote speakers include:
			              * Professor Eva Egron-Polak (International Association of Universities, France)
			              * Professor Jonathan Jansen (Rector, University of the Free State, South Africa)
			              * Professor Simon Marginson (University of Melbourne, Australia)
			              * Professor Nigel Thrift (Vice Chancellor, University of Warwick, UK)
			              * Professor Pandhyala B.G. Tilak (National University of Educational Planning &amp; Administration, India)
			
			              In addition, the Forum will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Forum Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the refereed Journal of the World Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the online edition of the Journal.
			
			              Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.
			
			
			
			              The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 14 May 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Forum website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Forum, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Forum website - <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com</A>&gt; .
			


			              We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Davos in January 2010.
