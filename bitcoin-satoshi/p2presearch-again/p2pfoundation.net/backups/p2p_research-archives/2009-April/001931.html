Hi Michel , Athina,

found this shared letter in a thread ... in relation to funding from
The Arts and Humanities Research Council
web: www.ahrc.ac.uk

I do not find a web link directly related to it on google,
<A HREF="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.gnu.gnuzilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=ahrc+funding+Professor+Philip+F.+Esler&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=">http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.gnu.gnuzilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=ahrc+funding+Professor+Philip+F.+Esler&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=</A>

so its better to stay cautious with the info


excerpts :

&quot;The New Impact Questions on Applications for Arts and Humanities Research
Council Funding

I am writing to remind you that the AHRC has now altered applications for
research grants to include questions relating to impact and to offer some
guidance on the context and nature of this change. In return for its
tripling the Science and Research Budget in the last ten years the UK
Government reasonably looks to our achieving a range of benefits beyond
academic excellence. It is not unreasonable to expect that the recipients of
public funding should indicate the broader benefits of their work to the
public at large. &quot;


&quot; Rather, we want the researchers we fund to work with non-academic partners
in private, public or third sectors to ensure that these varied impacts are
effectively demonstrated and supported, throughout the research lifecycle,
in order to add value, stimulate interest from wider stakeholders, including
the general public, and, where needed, actively highlight the need for
continued investment in the research base.
What impacts of this sort can we expect from arts and humanities
researchers? Here are some examples (but many others are possible):
*              Collaborations with organisations such as these:
o    local, regional or national museums, libraries, archives or heritage
centres
o    creative and performing arts organisations
o    commercial companies
o    Schools, colleges, youth organisations
o    Charities and voluntary organisations
o    Local, regional or national arts organisations and festivals
o    Hospitals and healthcare organisations
o    Faith groups
o    Prisons
o    Tourism and heritage organisations
o    Genealogy organisations
o    Media organisations
*         Impact on policy-related issues and organisations, such as:
o    Government (e.g. citizenship, IP, culture, security, ethnicity etc.)
o    Legal system (jurisprudence, international law, etc)
o    Local government (arts, culture, etc)
o     NGOs (e.g. charities, health-related organisations, think-tanks, etc)
*         Cultural impact
o    Issues of national, regional and local identities
o    Cultural histories (such as the Shah Abbas Exhibition at the British
Museum)
o    'Hidden' archives and neglected histories
o    Widening access through digitised archives
o    Media partners such as TV networks, radio producers, documentary
film-makers
*         Monetary impact
o    Spin-out companies/businesses
o    Consultancy advice

I cannot emphasise sufficiently that excellent research without obvious or
immediate impact will continue to be funded by the Research Councils and
will not be disadvantaged within the assessment process. While we are
looking for a genuine and conscientious attempt by researchers to identify
potential non-academic partners for their research, we are mindful of the
possibility that for some projects there may not be any.

Yours faithfully,
Professor Philip F. Esler

hi Joe, all

this is a useful-saddening-maddening discussion with a crunch indeed.

Today's notification of &quot;impact&quot; criteria henceforth to be formally
articulated by the fundable UK Arts and Humanities community might be of
interest. Apologies for length - I've slightly truncated but felt that this
might  resonate interestingly with discussion underway.

(How) can we make a plea for the deep social, moral, critical relevance of
the seemingly irrelevant?  Or is this irrelevant? I'm impressed by the
perspicacity of colleagues working on Knowledge Transfer questions within
this same research council so am baffled and torn - keep having visions of a
yes-men or bavos collective type grant submissions. Impact criteria and
occult hermeneutics arising around them are throwing all kinds of questions
onto academic desks. And onto those of potential partner organisations
understandably keen to get their share.

Deep impact

kia ora
sjn

ps - nothing yet on Research Council bean counters that relates to hormone
levels you'll be pleased to learn.
So how come the economics discussion scared all the gals off the list?



The New Impact Questions on Applications for Arts and Humanities Research
Council Funding

I am writing to remind you that the AHRC has now altered applications for
research grants to include questions relating to impact and to offer some
guidance on the context and nature of this change. In return for its
tripling the Science and Research Budget in the last ten years the UK
Government reasonably looks to our achieving a range of benefits beyond
academic excellence. It is not unreasonable to expect that the recipients of
public funding should indicate the broader benefits of their work to the
public at large. In addition, the Royal Charters of the Research Councils
require that we foster impact, as well as research and postgraduate
provision.

We can meet this challenge, since the magnificent research funded by the
AHRC and the other Research Councils has a huge impact on the wellbeing and
economy of the UK. Building on the HM Treasury definition of 'economic
impact', the Research Councils jointly describe impact as: the demonstrable
contribution that excellent research makes to society and the economy ...
Impact embraces all the extremely diverse ways in which research-related
knowledge and skills benefit individuals, organisations and nations by:
*         fostering global economic performance, and specifically the
economic competitiveness of the UK, *         increasing the effectiveness
of public services and policy, and
*         enhancing quality of life, health and creative output.
This very broad description is embodied in the questions that applicants for
research grants have to answer when they are completing the Impact Summary
that is being introduced into application forms for all the Research
Councils over 2009:
*          Who will benefit from this research?
*          How will they benefit?
 *         What will you do to ensure benefit?

It would be very wrong to suggest that we have introduced these new
questions as a way to pick winners who will help UK PLC. Rather, we want the
researchers we fund to work with non-academic partners in private, public or
third sectors to ensure that these varied impacts are effectively
demonstrated and supported, throughout the research lifecycle, in order to
add value, stimulate interest from wider stakeholders, including the general
public, and, where needed, actively highlight the need for continued
investment in the research base.
What impacts of this sort can we expect from arts and humanities
researchers? Here are some examples (but many others are possible):
*              Collaborations with organisations such as these:
o    local, regional or national museums, libraries, archives or heritage

o    commercial companies
o    Schools, colleges, youth organisations
o    Charities and voluntary organisations
o    Local, regional or national arts organisations and festivals
o    Hospitals and healthcare organisations
o    Faith groups
o    Prisons
o    Tourism and heritage organisations
o    Genealogy organisations
o    Media organisations
*         Impact on policy-related issues and organisations, such as:
o    Government (e.g. citizenship, IP, culture, security, ethnicity etc.)
o    Legal system (jurisprudence, international law, etc)
o    Local government (arts, culture, etc)
o     NGOs (e.g. charities, health-related organisations, think-tanks, etc)
*         Cultural impact
o    Issues of national, regional and local identities
o    Cultural histories (such as the Shah Abbas Exhibition at the British
Museum)
o    'Hidden' archives and neglected histories
o    Widening access through digitised archives
o    Media partners such as TV networks, radio producers, documentary
film-makers
