<PRE>sorry, forgot to reply to your last line:
 
other than that, it could be interesting, would be nice to know what kind fo collaboration you are thinking of

I don't have any clear ideas, lets see where the conversation will take us. There is only one thing where my mind is already set. I'm not interested in a condemning critique of the current situation, as this has been raised often enough and we could only be repetitive.
I am inspired by the George Siemens blog <A HREF="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/">http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/04/25/rough-week-for-higher-education/</A>&gt; 
that Ryan send a few day ago, particularly by the last sentence: 
&quot;We know what we don't want universities to be. We don't yet have thought leadership on what they should become.&quot;
That is what I'd like to think about.
A.

Thanks Andreas
I worked that out when i saw the site, it says 3rd WUF
I would have been surprised

	Hi Paola, this is a misunderstanding. It is not about the Third World, it is the 3rd World Universities Forum (the first was in 2008, the 2nd is this year...)

	Dear Andreas
	Thanks for sharing
	a few of us on this list already work in universities, and work with innovation
	I think the term 'third world' has been replaced with 'developing countries; which is preferred term, in fact that is out of date, and we use emerging economies instead, or some other euphemism
	
	the next question is why would a developing country forum would be held in switzerland? (as much as I love the country)
	would it not make sense to have it in a developing country
	(or does it coincide with the economic forum?)
	
	other than that, it could be interesting, would be nice to know what kind fo collaboration you are thinking of
	
	cheers

	       This could be an opportunity to develop a vision for the future of universities, something which could be considered to be a position associated with the p2p foundation. Is there some interest for collaboration?

	       THIRD WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM
	       Davos, Switzerland
	       9-11 January 2010
	
	       <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com</A>&gt;
	

	       Inspired partly by the success of World Economic Forum in hosting global conversations about emerging issues of economic policy, the World Universities Forum (WUF) was created in 2008 in the belief that academe must better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus. While WUF encourages conversations about all aspects of higher education policy and practice, the keynotes for the third WUF have been invited to consider issues of the current global economic crisis and its implications for universities.
	
	       Keynote speakers include:
	       * Professor Eva Egron-Polak (International Association of Universities, France)
	       * Professor Jonathan Jansen (Rector, University of the Free State, South Africa)
	       * Professor Simon Marginson (University of Melbourne, Australia)
	       * Professor Nigel Thrift (Vice Chancellor, University of Warwick, UK)
	       * Professor Pandhyala B.G. Tilak (National University of Educational Planning &amp; Administration, India)
	
	       In addition, the Forum will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Forum Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the refereed Journal of the World Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the online edition of the Journal.
	
	       Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.
	
	
	       The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 14 May 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Forum website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Forum, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Forum website - <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://universitiesforum.com/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com</A>&gt; .
	

	       We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Davos in January 2010.
	
	       Yours Sincerely,
	
	       Professor Fazal Rizvi
