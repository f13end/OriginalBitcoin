<PRE>Just a couple of quick notes, I'll answer to last message from David
later this week as I must absolutely finish something else first.

At least in the recent past, I **only** object to calling that P2P.
Whether TPB and file sharing is right, wrong, good or bad, I'm trying
to leave those questions aside right now, just to make the discussion
simpler.

&gt;<i> (at least from the viewpoint of the entertainment industry) would be that we

</I>&gt;<i> (with lots of extra material); as a TV broadcast either (seemingly) free or
</I>&gt;<i> pay-per-view; or, for that sake, as a slimmed down DVD version, handed out
</I>&gt;<i> (seemingly) for free with Sunday newspapers! File-sharing is here merely part

</I>&gt;<i> seen to actually contribute to the value of the content spread, although
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps more as an unintended by-effect than by deliberation. As with many

</I>&gt;<i> radical process of  outsourcing  labour to users. The end-users make part of
</I>&gt;<i> the effort of distribution, saving labour on the producer/distributor side, lo 
</I>&gt;<i> wer ing prices, altering competition balances, etc. When file-sharers thus help

</I>&gt;<i> agents in some respects (and may get sued in the process, adding insult to

</I>
Define little. The last two statements below are to take with a big
grain of salt, of course (**) (just like the ones from TPB founders
that they aren't making any money, just paying expenses): but I
wouldn't be surprised if their personal gain so far is quite more than
you or I made last year. No problem with that, my only objection was
the P2P definition.

&quot;Evidence in court showed they had set up a company in the British
Virgin Islands, a well-known tax haven, to squirrel away the profits
they made from advertising sales.&quot;

&quot;Prosecutor Hakan Roswall.. added that the site could be making as
much as $4 million annually off these ad revenues.&quot;

&quot;Pirate Bay started with a free-spirited, Robin Hood ethos, liberating
content from the shackles of capitalism for the benefit of the people,
but it has become a capitalist enterprise it its own right, with
advertising being handled by an agency in Tel Aviv and the money, &#8364;2
million last year, flowing into a bank in the Cayman Islands.&quot;

(**) and yes, the warning from the AAUP guy about malware is really
ridiculous...
