<PRE>really great nathan ...

could you publish this  as such in Ning, (i tried, didn't want to post for
some reason) and perhaps in a more cogent way for the regular blog ...

i can only react mid-april

&gt;<i> Hi Michel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't help getting all gitty when you mentioned the OS Fridge in a
</I>&gt;<i> recent lecture. Unless this argument was tied up near the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> presentation cut from the video, I don't believe you argued the free fridge
</I>&gt;<i> successfully. Oh my! Let's then explore some ways we can better convince our
</I>&gt;<i> audience a free OS fridge will happen via universal p2p methodology.
</I>&gt;<i> Because, clearly, we know it will happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Official sounding theory to cite
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The theory of productive recursion is one Marcin and I are cooking up to
</I>&gt;<i> argue--or at least which aims toward--the free fridge. I did some quacking
</I>&gt;<i> on recursion and Marcin fabricated the formula. For fun, I call it the
</I>&gt;<i> Cravens-Jakubowski theory of Productive Recursion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Productive Recursion: Production methods used to lower cost of products
</I>&gt;<i> when simplified for rapid personal fabrication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://openfarmtech.org/index.php?title=Productive_Recursion">http://openfarmtech.org/index.php?title=Productive_Recursion</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The section below shows rather than paying $3000 for at cost production of
</I>&gt;<i> the CEB press ($2k in materials, $1k in labor) - already a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> factor of 10 lower than the competition - we intend to produce it at $1400,
</I>&gt;<i> half of the previous cost - for factor 20 cost reduction over the industrial
</I>&gt;<i> counterpart. If typical industrial product is 4-6 times above cost, we are
</I>&gt;<i> saying that we can produce items at 8-16 less cost than the mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> industrial production. This is a hint at abundance economies, though it
</I>&gt;<i> requires physical proof for validation - by building the item in question
</I>&gt;<i> from scrap steel in a flexible, community-supported fabrication facility. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given all things P2P, this approach, we're convinced, accelerates faster
</I>&gt;<i> than ever toward a fridge we can walk into town and pick up without need for
</I>&gt;<i> monetary metrics. Let's explore how this can be done:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Establish Local Fab Lab
</I>&gt;<i> First we need a locally accessible fab lab to build the Fridge anywhere on
</I>&gt;<i> the globe.
</I>&gt;<i> All labs are standardized for customization so the same Fridge can be built
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide at the local lab. Standardization ensures people or machines can
</I>&gt;<i> follow the same instructions to produce a full functioning Fridge. Universal
</I>&gt;<i> standards also ensure materials production, distributed assembly, and
</I>&gt;<i> transport networks are best unified to direct toward personal fabrication to
</I>&gt;<i> the greatest extent possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Establish Materials &amp; Transport Network
</I>&gt;<i> This asserts how materials are organized locally and globally to feed the
</I>&gt;<i> lab. A fab lab functions not without materials and a transport network to
</I>&gt;<i> delivery necessary material resources. We can imagine this materials network
</I>&gt;<i> as physical nodes and links represented by a semantic web interface.[1][2]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Establish Product Design Coordinated with Fab Lab and Materials &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> Transport Network Design
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All products, including the design of the Fridge, are notified of the
</I>&gt;<i> design proposal and in turn these communities build a more efficient and
</I>&gt;<i> flexible Fab Lab and Materials &amp; Transport Network to fabricate the
</I>&gt;<i> forthcoming design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. A global community forms a single hub to create the best Fridge ever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are the design challenges for product assembly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Design of the fridge itself
</I>&gt;<i>    - Design of the fabrication method or tasks performed. The instructions
</I>&gt;<i>    people or machines follow to construct the product
</I>&gt;<i>    - Materials distribution and transport network is redesigned as needed
</I>&gt;<i>    to align with demand. Materials are delivered to labs as demands are made,
</I>&gt;<i>    or in our case, as fabs are queued for assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Foreseeable Production Transitions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before we explore production transitions, let's note the notion: &quot;nothing
</I>&gt;<i> is free.&quot; Presently, we know the material world as finite. The p2p
</I>&gt;<i> organization of production or peer production (open manufacturing) model
</I>&gt;<i> presented reduces scarcity to 'practically' free status-- meaning--the
</I>&gt;<i> production model illuminated here makes stuff 'free enough' as not to
</I>&gt;<i> warrant a monetary status in the foreseeable future. To achieve zero
</I>&gt;<i> monetary in production, costs may be reduced first until organizational
</I>&gt;<i> nodes are universally linked to eliminate all monetarily pegged scarcities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first two points above demonstrate the scarcity cost barriers to break
</I>&gt;<i> via a global p2p platform. The 3-4th point--design--is already proven a
</I>&gt;<i> financially free enterprise. It involves mostly time and effort and assumes
</I>&gt;<i> costs are already paid or appropriately externalized. The &quot;reward&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;payment&quot; for this mass amount of cognitive actions is &quot;given a return in
</I>&gt;<i> investment&quot; by generated a better Fridge for less, and further, nothing less
</I>&gt;<i> than nothing unless otherwise requested. The ordering of these areas may not
</I>&gt;<i> reflect the order in which costs are reduced or removed, yet this section
</I>&gt;<i> explores how costs are reduced or removed conceivably before actual trail
</I>&gt;<i> and error meets the variety of unknowable challenges ahead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like any decent futurist, we'll break it down for our client into at least
</I>&gt;<i> two scenarios which assumes a progression toward--and in so doing arguing
</I>&gt;<i> for--technological unemployment. This story time is to better imagine, if
</I>&gt;<i> but incompletely, some of the challenges ahead in our journey toward a world
</I>&gt;<i> in which a free Fridge is made. I invite you to write scenarios in addition
</I>&gt;<i> to these in light of your knowledge and imagination accessible from here to
</I>&gt;<i> save future trail and error and to accelerate the rapid movement toward a
</I>&gt;<i> superbly advanced free Fridge building technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scenario 1: The Renaissance of Craft Production. 'Partially' free lab,
</I>&gt;<i> 'mostly' free materials, and free labor (sweat equity)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I live in Nacogodches, Texas and I want a free fridge, but the nearest
</I>&gt;<i> 'almost' free fab facilities are in Austin, TX. Hey Bryan! I could pay the
</I>&gt;<i> fab team to build the Fridge and ship it, but because I want as little
</I>&gt;<i> monetary metric going into the cosmos, I travel to the lab personally to
</I>&gt;<i> fabricate it. At this stage, there may be a waiting list to use the lab as
</I>&gt;<i> other labs are under construction in the Austin area to meet this rapidly
</I>&gt;<i> accelerant demand. It may cost per hour for me to use the tools (due to
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance costs) at the lab, but I do it because building my own Fridge
</I>&gt;<i> cost less financially compared to the mass produced version; or less than
</I>&gt;<i> having a fabricator do it; even when my time is considered; which means I'm
</I>&gt;<i> probably not part of the so called workforce. The value added in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> the savings is by a fab lab that assures considerable customization of the
</I>&gt;<i> Fridge and my empowerment in building a majority of it myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the Fridge parts were build from scrap metal by robots in a fully
</I>&gt;<i> automated lab in Houston. This lab was designed after an open source
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration effort with participation from MIT's Center for Bits and
</I>&gt;<i> Atoms, University of Texas' Automated Design Lab, and University of Tokyo's
</I>&gt;<i> Robotic Technology Research Initiative, to name a few notables. Materials
</I>&gt;<i> then are shipped over in time for my appointment at the lab. Austin
</I>&gt;<i> presently lacks cost effective demand to produce the mini-mills and rapid
</I>&gt;<i> casting facilities until the next year or so. If I decided not to customize
</I>&gt;<i> the Fridge, for a fee it would be assembled in Houston and shipped. Shipping
</I>&gt;<i> is thus far additional cost. Folk globally are reducing transportation costs
</I>&gt;<i> such as creating solar powered transport and self maintainable travel
</I>&gt;<i> passages. In one district, Tokyo presently has a fully automated transport
</I>&gt;<i> system, one our global community is working to replicate world-wide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An instruction program reads my unique Fridge design and instructs
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step how I build it in language my non-expertise understands. Do I
</I>&gt;<i> use SKDB[3] or OSCOMAK[4]? Well, whatever the interface is we proceed! Based
</I>&gt;<i> on a custom design, I install trance inducing led lights that emit patterns
</I>&gt;<i> when opening the fridge. With the help of the laser, smatterings of haiku
</I>&gt;<i> are engraved to fill the entirety of outward flat face of the Fridge. Its
</I>&gt;<i> this level of customization that encouraged people to pay a little more than
</I>&gt;<i> the mass production version in the past. These funds were in turn used to
</I>&gt;<i> reduce production costs that have lead to this present stage. It now costs
</I>&gt;<i> less even with these mentioned perks, as networks are standardized for
</I>&gt;<i> customization and global participation develops the series of vital
</I>&gt;<i> materials networks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To save time, we avoid how a monetary system might work as processes are
</I>&gt;<i> made more efficient and work becomes play. In this foreseeable world it is
</I>&gt;<i> obvious that work time will have less and less value as tasks are performed
</I>&gt;<i> by machines and people become difficult to labor market. I'll discuss this
</I>&gt;<i> issue later as such a topic alone warrants volumes of text to articulate,
</I>&gt;<i> that is, after we've argued successfully that physical production is rapidly
</I>&gt;<i> going toward the individual, abandoning the roughly two hundred year
</I>&gt;<i> struggle between capital and labor, or if you like, by unifying and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore dismantle the distinction between capital and labor as we venture
</I>&gt;<i> into primarily use of neo-craft production better known as personal
</I>&gt;<i> fabrication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Toward Full Automation. Free materials, free lab, labor cost
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Materials are acquired, transported, recycled or upcycled[5] in a fashion
</I>&gt;<i> that does not deplete ecological resources. All lab facilities either do not
</I>&gt;<i> break down or able to regenerate without human effort. The term for this is
</I>&gt;<i> permafacture.[6] The person may need to bare the travel expense
</I>&gt;<i> (time/energy) to the lab to customize and observe the assembly. This may
</I>&gt;<i> hardly be considered labor as at this stage it is hardly hands on, but not
</I>&gt;<i> yet fabbed or able to ship directly to the home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Full Automation. Free materials, free lab, no labor
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robots can do it all. Fabrication facilities are aligned with materials
</I>&gt;<i> networks seamlessly with each design creation and revision simplified in a
</I>&gt;<i> manner attentive children can use to provide for themselves without parental
</I>&gt;<i> involvement. This means legal citizenship, if such a thing exists at this
</I>&gt;<i> stage, begins with mental aptitude rather than age. This is done without
</I>&gt;<i> strong AI[7], but let's assume it exists anyway as a burden to our ethical
</I>&gt;<i> perceptions. In whatever configuration or relative size you like, the Fridge
</I>&gt;<i> is free at no cost monetarily or ecologically, yet perhaps this is at a cost
</I>&gt;<i> to one's well exercised work ethic, at which point, this person deskills the
</I>&gt;<i> machines so to perform tasks oneself to continue the anachronistic ethos.
</I>&gt;<i> Machines are deskilled as needed at anytime to prevent a human slave class,
</I>&gt;<i> a personal type dependent on machines for 'everything'. This machine
</I>&gt;<i> deskilling option ensures everyone can learn with the hands how material
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts are made. The end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now where's my free Fridge?!
