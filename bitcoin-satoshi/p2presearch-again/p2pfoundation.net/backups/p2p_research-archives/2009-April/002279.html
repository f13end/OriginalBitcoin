<PRE>Andreas:

Historically, the University of Wales chose to do what, say, the University
of Texas system did not.  They validate centrally and educate on distributed
campuses.  Whereas at class at UT Austin doesn't necessarily count toward a
degree at UT El Paso and vice versa.  So, when they realized they had this
capability (and I have visited and met with them and they document it fairly
rigorously...see <A HREF="http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=e7062">http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=e7062</A>)

As a trainor, I am interested in getting as much validation for my work as
possible.  So I use facilities like the Institute of Leadership and
Management validations, trade association validations, and am looking at
using University of Wales validations.  I teach (or people train themselves
in communities of practice), and students get a bucket of credentials.

If I were a university, I'd hate me because I disaggregate their offerings
and cherry-pick p2p relations with individual faculty, departments, classes
etc.  This was how p2p started to erode business (e.g. Sun Microsystems).
Institutions require command and control of aggregated product sets.  P2P
melts that aggregation by allowing customization under the control of the
peer.

I saw IBM start to melt when they moved into open systems.  They have
actually handled the transformation far better than most.  But I remember
product meetings inside IBM where people said we were destroying the firm by
moving away from Blue-only frameworks.  The same will be heard in
universities.  But the moral imperative placed on faculty's shoulders is
that they must recognize they are part of a corporate scheme, or they most
open up.

The argument of inability to judge quality at other institutions only goes
so far in the instrumental education environment you portray.  Then they
will claim their programs have special linked components.  But does anyone
really believe that getting an MBA class in accounting at Dartmouth is
systematically different than getting one at Penn State?  No.  The intent is
to create elite associations.  Faculty, moral faculty, will only enable that
so far once e-learning pervades and the place a student lives is less
important.  For now, all sorts of institutional mechanics like alumni
relations block that ethical transformation.  Even now very few faculty
associate with their institution--they associate with their field.  The
seeds of collapse are there.

</I>&gt;<i> Good question Ryan. I think we need to separate issue of education from the

</I>&gt;<i> The instrumentality of knowledge delivery started by unis has sure spread

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To put it provocatively: there is no other institution around that can sell

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt my own expertise, categorically.  But lets spin the tables.  Under
</I>&gt;<i> what circumstances could we envision systematic collapse of universities on
</I>&gt;<i> a large scale?  And if we cannot imagine them not existing, what is it about
</I>&gt;<i> them that gives them such heroic sustainability?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, what model of higher education is sustainable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine a market model failure is the only thing that could endanger the
</I>&gt;<i> system.  That means the economics of earning university credentials must be
</I>&gt;<i> undermined and research budgets would need to have a sustained period of
</I>&gt;<i> decline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Hakim Bey's idea of universities as research monasteries was to ensue,
</I>&gt;<i> then the teaching side would need to fail financially.  What is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> true is that the cost of college has exceeded the inflation rate in growth
</I>&gt;<i> for a number of years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/20/pf/college/college_price.moneymag/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/20/pf/college/college_price.moneymag/index.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That seems unsustainable, obviously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My scenario would be that large numbers of the middle classes who entered
</I>&gt;<i> the academy in the 1950s and especially the 1960s might be priced out.  That
</I>&gt;<i> could happen during this financial downturn.  Student debt growth is
</I>&gt;<i> enormous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nelliemae.com/library/research_10.html">http://www.nelliemae.com/library/research_10.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under such scenarios, it would be hard to show increases in research
</I>&gt;<i> funding which has been also growing steadily in recent years (in the US).
</I>&gt;<i>  Politically, universities would be perceived as elites and no amount of
</I>&gt;<i> athletic boosting would likely turn that tide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> State budgets in the US will be crushed for at least five years--possibly a
</I>&gt;<i> decade or even two.  That will pressure endowments as will market investment
</I>&gt;<i> losses and low bond rates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If universities reach a point were they are not economic engines for
</I>&gt;<i> localities...based on trims along the edges, they will lose that element of
</I>&gt;<i> support as well.  That would be the last straw I'd think, because it is a
</I>&gt;<i> great deal to have a university concentrating cash in your town.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, you might ask can universities cut costs, keep relevant research,
</I>&gt;<i> finesse state funding, fend off e-learning and open validation threats and
</I>&gt;<i> still deliver a product.  I sort of doubt it.  I'd guess it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> sustainable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First faculties will grow top-heavy as the big grant earners hang on for
</I>&gt;<i> long careers and few replacement slots can be freed up.  Next, market
</I>&gt;<i> innovations will clip market share both in research and degree earnings.  No
</I>&gt;<i> amount of certificates and non-degree programs will offset this in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion.  Life long learning doesn't fit the university model all that well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of market innovations will be p2p education and research facilities.
</I>&gt;<i>  It is already occurring albeit not at a 2020 threat rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, it is easier to envision higher ed collapse than healthcare
</I>&gt;<i> collapse, and no few people are predicting the latter.  The trends are
</I>&gt;<i> similar and often interrelated.
