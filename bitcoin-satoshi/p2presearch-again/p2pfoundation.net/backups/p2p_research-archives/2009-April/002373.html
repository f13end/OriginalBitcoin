<PRE>Thanks for your response Paola

I do find some of the people are open, but the system does not help
regarding interaction and collaboration (No time to explain that or put it
in context at present).

I wonder &quot;where you fit&quot; regarding HE, teaching learning etc. I am
interested in your observations and would understand them better with more
context.

</I>&gt;<i> Most of the things your write below are exactly what I wanted to say but
</I>&gt;<i> did not have time to articulate, in relation to the role of unis and
</I>&gt;<i> lecturers etc
</I>


&gt;<i> quick comments
</I>&gt;<i> 1.hopefully they have open boundaries, meaning that we do not have to 'go'
</I>&gt;<i> to interact with them
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> 2. learning pertains to life, and the fact that you are not an academic
</I>&gt;<i> does not mean that you dont know someting about academica, academics tend to
</I>&gt;<i> be ver narrow minded cause they know extremely well their domain, and are
</I>&gt;<i> totally ignorant of many other things
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.i do believe in self directedness, but I would continue to emphasise the
</I>&gt;<i> need for becoming acquainted with the body of literature. I mean, i would
</I>&gt;<i> expect anone who is learning a topic to familiarise themselves with
</I>&gt;<i> everything that there is to know about it, including the standard
</I>&gt;<i> sillabus.
</I>
however what I see is that today professors and all tell their students what
&gt;<i> *they* consider the version of the truth, thus leaving the student under
</I>&gt;<i> tthe impression that everything elese dos not matter or is false. I hope in
</I>&gt;<i> the future students will be able to put together what their professor says,
</I>&gt;<i> and compare it with what other professors say, and then become self directed
</I>&gt;<i> in what they consider sould be pursued further
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4, I see change happen from the top, but a lot is 'wasted' due to systemic
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, of which I would like to discuss in more detail when possible. i
</I>&gt;<i> see web based technologies already in place offering the greatest potential
</I>&gt;<i> for change from the bottom up, and people not using them. looks to me that
</I>&gt;<i> the processes and procedures need to be revised
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This topic really interests me - but as a non-academic I'm not considering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attending and I don't submit papers to journals because papers get peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reviewed and my writing is too journalistic  - I only describe what I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> observed in practice and thought about, and I don't  relate it to adademic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research. This is because, as a practitioner, I don't know enough (if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything) about relevant academic research.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if anyone will be going? I wonder how this looks from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> academic side of the fence. I would be interested in contributing to this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was an appropriate way to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From my informal education side I think what is happening  in the informal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sector has pointers for where higher education may go in future. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that what post-graduate level independent, self-directed, learners are doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (online, outside of universities, to continue their learning) may have some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relevance to universities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the impression there is a move towards self direction in some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> university courses. For example in some situations students are able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include self directed work (events they have attended, additional things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have read or followed up in some way) in their online portfolios of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work (presumably this influences how their work is judged in some way). I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think of two presentations I've heard at different events in London recently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which were relevant to this trend. (Philip Butler for instance is doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting work related to this in his work using Moodle, also someone else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - probably at CDE London - is doing work with music students which includes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capturing many different aspects of the music itself and the student's work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related to it.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know that when I was studying with the OU there was great freedom to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create your own personal, very individual, degree course. The courses that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made up the degree could be selected from various faculties, as long as you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were progressing appropriately in your level of study and you judged that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you had the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle the course you had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chosen. This opportunity to choose meant there could be a unique and useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationship between formal OU courses (studied  in your &quot;spare time&quot;) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you had already learned (and were continuing to learn) in your parallel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life in the &quot;real world&quot; of &quot;the university of life&quot; and full-time work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think there is already much more flexibility, such as credit transfers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than when I was back in the sixth-form discovering what universities offered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ( and failing to go to one). I hope there will be increasing flexibility in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future university courses, with many more degrees offering the variety I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enjoyed through my OU studies (perhaps this already happens).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also wonder about the role of universities in accrediting people at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end of their studies. I think people want accreditataion normally in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to enter the full-time employment market. I think (in some areas of work,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially those that relate to information) we are moving away from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-time permanent jobs towards a more independent, dynamic approach to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> earning a living. I think it will become  less usual to have a full-time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permanent job and more usual to have short term collaborative work (with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual people often having a portfolio of projects they are working on,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps in a number of different collaborative teams).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think students (working towards information related work) will gradually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> develop and demonstrate competence (perhaps through voluntary work) by being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved in projects (perhaps &quot;real&quot; projects, perhaps &quot;artificial&quot; projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set up for learning purposes only). As they demonstrate competence  they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be offered more challenging opportunities to prove their worth (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the system in Appache - as I understand it - of rising though merit).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ultimately people, who  are good enough, will be invited to take part in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects that are being done for money. These opportunities to work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money may well be happening in parallel with university studies. Any student
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who has sufficiently developed and showcased his/her skills in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attract a portfolio of paid projects may then have reduced motivation to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to the end of a university course in order to get formal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accreditation. This is particularly likely if  the student has dicsovered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how to continue studying well outside of the formal system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if the main role of the university may become one of mentoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the students (rather then lecturing/teaching them and testing them). If you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are a student then the main difference between independent informal learning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and learning at a univirsity may be the opportunity to have someone who is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your personal mentor, guiding you through your individual learning journey,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helping you to clarify what you might need to learn next and how you might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go about it. Of course it is possible this personal mentoring role is how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universities tend to work now anyhow - I don't know - I'm not in the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if the need for additional provision in the &quot;Third World&quot; may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean that new things tend to happen there faster - but I don't know about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that. However various things I have been reading seem to suggest change is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the way everywhere - but I don't know abou tthat either e.g
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27taylor.html?pagewanted=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27taylor.html?pagewanted=1</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder what those of you in the academic system see happening.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> THIRD WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Davos, Switzerland
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 9-11 January 2010
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com">https://outlook.ntu.ac.uk/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://UniversitiesForum.com</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Inspired partly by the success of World Economic Forum in hosting global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversations about emerging issues of economic policy, the World
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Universities Forum (WUF) was created in 2008 in the belief that academe must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus. While WUF
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encourages conversations about all aspects of higher education policy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice, the keynotes for the third WUF have been invited to consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues of the current global economic crisis and its implications for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keynote speakers include:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Professor Eva Egron-Polak (International Association of Universities,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> France)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Professor Jonathan Jansen (Rector, University of the Free State, South
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Africa)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Professor Simon Marginson (University of Melbourne, Australia)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Professor Nigel Thrift (Vice Chancellor, University of Warwick, UK)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Professor Pandhyala B.G. Tilak (National University of Educational
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Planning &amp; Administration, India)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition, the Forum will also include numerous paper, workshop and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> colloquium presentations. We would particularly like to invite you to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respond to the Forum Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> written papers for publication in the refereed Journal of the World
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online edition of the Journal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abstract) is 14 May 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> submission. Full details of the Forum, including an online proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> submission form, may be found at the Forum website -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://universitiesforum.com/">http://UniversitiesForum.com</A> &lt;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> join us in Davos in January 2010.
