<PRE>I am still at a loss as to how to communicate my insight about the
transcendence of capitalism and the new stage of production and community
that follows and I keep making an effort.

One thing that occurs to me to mention now is the value of 'services' in the
new context of a world in which all people are 'doubly-free'.

In capitalist industrialization we have products that become the property of
the purchaser, in most cases, and it is at this point that the ... commons,
or the aggregate of all resources available for production, is somewhat
diminished, in a sense, by the transition of the goods/products and
resources into private ownership.

On a meta-theoretical level, the goods are still part of the flow of
materials in society, unless shot into space, but, for argument's sake,
these materials are removed.

In reading through your PDF about the commons of the future I was inspired
to mention what is becoming more and more common in the SOA (service
oriented architecture) models of the software world, and to mention that
this is being obviously extended into the realm of hard/durable goods
manufacturing.

Specifically, service oriented architecture allows for the extension of the
'commons' to include goods that are 'atomized' for personal use by
maintaining a link, through services and maintenance, back to the larger
common resource pool.

Lifetime maintenance, leasing, and a whole host of industry terms are being
used to categorize this evolving area.

I realize some may argue with the mechanics of these innovations (I pause at
using the word innovation) but I merely mention it to draw attention to a
new-ish view of the commons as a flow of resources in the form of durable
goods that pass through the hands of 'consumer-owner-producers' and back
into the production shops that maintain and innovate on these goods.  These
shops are also maintaining the 'new re-enclosure of the open commons&quot; (just
trying to show the connection, here) as goods and raw materials that are
wrought, re-wrought, and cared for to meet the needs of society (messy).

To me, this is an important little view of the 'new' because it sheds some
light on the simplicity of targeted revolt (as opposed to the sought after
ubiquitous revolt) of the doing from the deed, as I understand it from the
Commoner site.

As an example, I just came up with a little business plan.


   - We start a little coop to make bicycles.
   - We narrow the market to goods that have a naturally regular ownership
   transition cycle, where the goods would normally be trashed.
   - Specifically, we sell the use of childrens bicycles as a service.
   - The shop and the bikes are owned by the consumers and producers
   together.
   - We 'lease-rent' the bikes for as long as needed, and then reclaim and
   remanufacture them.
   - Over time, the coop's larger mission of stewarding the raw materials
   for bike manufacture are integrated.  We buy land for making rubber,
   remanufacture tires, steel, whatever.
   - We also teach people to be a part of this themselves.


This is a pretty simple idea to increase the value of the 'bike mobility'
commons, a new 're-enclosed' and relatively open commons (especially if
redistributive economics enable those without to be those with).

Anyways, we don't talk about this much, but it seemed like a nice time to
mention it.  The SOA of the cmmn 'icon' car project out of the Netherlands
follows this logic, generally.   People don't buy the cars...they become
long term partner/owners in the enterprise.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; status.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your ideas on defining capital and labor are a bit broad.  I would
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They seem broad only for current society, since nowadays almost all labor
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> capitalistic. But historically they are quite specific: capitalism requires
</I>&gt;<i> what Marx called the &quot;doppelt freie Lohnarbeiter&quot; (&quot;doubly free worker&quot; --
</I>&gt;<i> not sure what is the correct English translation), i.e. people who are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot; in a double sense: &quot;free&quot; human beings who are allowed to sell their
</I>&gt;<i> labor power (not slaves or serfs), but also &quot;free&quot; of the means of
</I>&gt;<i> production, i.e. without access to tools and resources what would allow
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> to produce for themselves, without having to sell their labor power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today, almost everybody is a &quot;doubly free worker&quot;, but that was not always
</I>&gt;<i> the case. Creating the doubly free worker was a historical process that
</I>&gt;<i> comprised, on the one hand, the liberation of slaves/serfs and, on the
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, the &quot;enclosure of the commons&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure</A>&gt;, the privatization of land and
</I>&gt;<i> other resources which had formerly belonged to all. That historical process
</I>&gt;<i> is described by Marx in his chapter(s) on the &quot;so-called primitive
</I>&gt;<i> accumulation&quot; in Capital I, starting here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm">http://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm</A> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While capitalism became possible only through the &quot;enclosure of the
</I>&gt;<i> commons&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that separated people from direct access to the means of production, the
</I>&gt;<i> transition to a post-capitalist will require a &quot;reopening of the commons,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which reverses that historical process. And indeed we see such a reopening
</I>&gt;<i> already taking place, as new commons are created (free software, Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) and struggles for old, or former commons (land, water etc.) are
</I>&gt;<i> increasing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encourage you to point me and others to a portrait of what such a system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would look like...say on an island...or a sea stead.  How would it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work?  Would interest and investment be forbidden?  What if most people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't like those rules?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marx has only left sparse notes about how a post-capitalist society might
</I>&gt;<i> look like, as I mentioned--that was not his topic, and he considered any
</I>&gt;<i> detailed descriptions of such a society as premature and utopian. I guess
</I>&gt;<i> he
</I>&gt;<i> considered it impossible to really imagine such a society in his times, and
</I>&gt;<i> he was probably right, but I also think that has changed since we're now
</I>&gt;<i> seeing the beginnings of a possible post-capitalist way of production
</I>&gt;<i> emerging around us: commons-based peer production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, we're still far away from a fully fledged commons-based peer
</I>&gt;<i> economy, but I think we can get there. As Stan already mentioned, I've
</I>&gt;<i> written about how such a society might look like. For a short overview, you
</I>&gt;<i> might want to check my recent article, &quot;The Commons of the Future&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.commoner.org.uk/?p=78">http://www.commoner.org.uk/?p=78</A>&gt;.

</I>&gt;<i> here:
