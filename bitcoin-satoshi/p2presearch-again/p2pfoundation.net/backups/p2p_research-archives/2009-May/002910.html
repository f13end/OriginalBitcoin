<PRE>Hi Ryan,

I was wondering if you could write down your &quot;non-political&quot; view of p2p,
that you expressed a few times in this forum, for publication in our blog?
Perhaps non-political is not the good word, but perhaps you know what I
mean, i.e. your saying it is 'independent' of things like capitalism and
socialism etc...

Michel

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brilliant:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By Arianna Huffington, Huffington Post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A series of recent meetings with members of Barack Obama's economic team
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (including running into Larry Summers on my way to an appointment in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> West Wing, leading to a spirited back-and-forth that made me feel like I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back at Cambridge, debating the smartest kid in the class), left me with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pair of indelible impressions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) These are all good people, many of them brilliant, working incredibly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard with the best of intentions to solve the country's financial crisis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) They are operating on the basis of an outdated cosmology that places
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> banks at the center of the economic universe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Talking about our financial crisis with them is like beaming back to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2nd century and discussing astronomy with Ptolemy. Just as Ptolemy was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convinced we live in a geocentric universe -- and made the math work to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;prove&quot; his flawed theories -- Obama's senior economic team is convinced we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> live in a bank-centric universe, and keeps offering its versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;epicycles&quot; and &quot;eccentric circles&quot; to rationalize their approach to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bailout. And because, like Ptolemy, they are really smart, they are really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good at rationalizing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's easy to get lost debating the complexity of each new iteration of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each new bailout, but the devil here is not in the details -- but in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obsolete cosmology.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you believe the universe is revolving around the earth -- when, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact, it isn't -- all the good intentions in the world, and all the endless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nights spent coming up with plans like Tim Geithner's Public-Private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Investment Program will be for naught.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The successive bailout plans have been frustrating to many observers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (yours truly included), but when you realize how fully the economic team is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mired in a bank-centric universe, all the moves suddenly make perfect sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is one example. Everybody agrees on the paramount importance of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freeing up credit for individuals and businesses. In a bank-centric
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universe, the solution was a bailout plan giving hundreds of billions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> banks. It failed because, instead of using the money to make loans, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> banks &quot;are keeping it in the bank because their balance sheets had gotten so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad,&quot; as the president himself acknowledged on Jay Leno. As a result, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration, again according to the president, had to &quot;set up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> securitized market for student loans and auto loans outside of the banking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system&quot; in order to &quot;get credit flowing again.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But think of all the time we wasted while the first scheme predictably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failed. And how much better off we'd now be if we had provided credit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly through credit unions or small healthy community banks or, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happened during the Depression, through a new entity like the Reconstruction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finance Corporation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Luckily, there is a plethora of economic Galileos out there who recognize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the old bank-centric cosmology is just plain wrong. But while Joseph
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stiglitz, Simon Johnson, Jeffrey Sachs, Nassim Taleb, Niall Ferguson, Paul
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Krugman, etc. are not being imprisoned for life for their heretical views --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are also not being listened to. Which is really surprising for an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration that has prided itself on a &quot;team of rivals&quot; approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Worse, as the fundamental flaw in the administration's cosmology becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more and more evident, the economic team around the president is closing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ranks. Even David Axelrod, once the administration's champion of a more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skeptical view of a bank-centric universe, appears to be peering through the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Geithner-Summers telescope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back in February, he crossed swords with Geithner, arguing for executive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pay caps. But there he was on Sunday, whiffing on a pro-populist softball
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offered up by Fox News' Chris Wallace, who asked: &quot;When taxpayers are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> putting up most of the money and taking more of the risk, why would the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obama administration allow some of these executives to get even richer?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Axelrod's answer? &quot;On some of these programs, we're asking financial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> companies to come in and help solve this problem by providing more lending,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by buying up toxic assets and so on. We don't want to create disincentives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and undermine the program.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Asking&quot; them? Aren't we, in fact, bribing them with massive capital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infusions and loan guarantees? That's what being surrounded by a group of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modern day Ptolemys will do to a person.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, it's less of a surprise that Geithner and Summers believe in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bank-centrism -- they're both creatures of it. Which is why it wasn't a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shock when it was reported this weekend that Summers had received $5.2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> million for advising a hedge fund last year, or that he received hundreds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thousands of dollars in speaking fees from some of the very banks --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs -- that have been on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiving end of billions in taxpayers money. Billions that have come with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very few strings attached -- and almost no transparency.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am in no way suggesting there is anything corrupt about this or any quid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pro quo involved. It's just that in a bank-centric universe, funneling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no-strings-attached money to too-big-to-fail banks is the logical thing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So is arguing that the banking crisis is just a liquidity problem rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than an insolvency one, as Geithner continues to do (and if the stress tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come back declaring Citi solvent, it will be high time to start stress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing the stress testers).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In a bank-centric universe, it's also no surprise that &quot;mark-to-market&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accounting rules, in which banks have to calculate and report their assets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on what those assets are actually worth, instead of what they'd like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them to be worth, are being abandoned. A good name for the reworked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accounting standards would be mark-to-fantasy, because that's basically what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balance sheets will be under these new rules. Of course, to a true believer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in bank-centrism, the problem with mark-to-market is that it's not good for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the banks. It's the accounting equivalent of Galileo's telescope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Last week at the G-20 meeting, Gordon Brown proclaimed that &quot;the old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Washington consensus is over.&quot; But when it comes to attacking the financial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crisis, the zombie Wall Street/Washington consensus that has everything in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> America orbiting around the banks is still the order of the day.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The longer bank-centrism is the dominant cosmology in the Obama
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration -- and the longer it takes to switch to a plan that reflects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a cosmology in which the American people are the center of the universe and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are deemed too-big-to-fail -- the greater the risk that the economic crisis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be more prolonged than necessary. And the greater the suffering the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crisis will continue to cause.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is an enormous human cost to this bank-centric dogma. Unemployment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already at levels not seen since 1983, is skyrocketing. In many places in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the country, it's approaching 20 percent (and in Detroit it's 22 percent).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Writing about the &quot;grand book&quot; that is the universe, Galileo declared that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it &quot;cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and interpret the characters in which it is written... without these, one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wandering about in a dark labyrinth.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's where we find ourselves today, wandering about in a dark financial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> labyrinth -- being led by good men blinded by an obsolete view of the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> President Obama needs to open his inner economic circle to those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> untethered to this flawed way of thinking and acknowledge that navigating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our economic crisis using maps based on a cosmology that places banks at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> center of the universe can only lead to our being lost at sea for years to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come.
