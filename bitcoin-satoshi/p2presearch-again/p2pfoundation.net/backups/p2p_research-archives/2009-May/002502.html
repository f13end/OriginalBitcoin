<PRE>Amazing , Great replies !

I feel this topic could go on for ever !

Right now, I feel like using the perspective of ( the feeling of ? )
security...
I want to see if we can collaboratively develop suggestions for solutions.

----

Can we feel secure without having specific control on one specific object,
place or person ?
Can we feel secure when knowing that our interdependence can rely on
&quot;requests&quot; to and from others.

How do we choose to experience security ?
Do we need reference points ?  Can we develop distributed reference points ?

How can these questions be answered ?

I ll give it an attempt below,
re-opening a few questions,
and re-opening the topic of information systems - including money -,
consciousness, ...


-------------

What is &quot;*engagement*&quot; in a p2p paradigm of relationships ?

Is engagement in a p2p approach about staying open to collaboratively
empower each other towards an aim,   and not about specific mutual
expectations ?

How can we visualize *resilience* in p2p systems ? Through its *capacity to
understand and learn* / adapt ?

Is there any situation in p2p systems where *coercion* is being used ?
Or is it merely a matter of each peer *making choices* in relation to *what
it can do* towards supporting a choice...
without needing to impose action on others ?

Yet ... choices indirectly impact the environment which we can all
experience.

Is &quot;engagement&quot; merely that of *( having access to ) participating* when one
wants to choose to participate / equipotentiality ?

<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Equipotentiality">http://p2pfoundation.net/Equipotentiality</A>

*How do we collaboratively visualize the ( potential ) impacts of our
choices on our shared environments*.  How can each of us have the potential
to make informed choices,
as to potentially *decide to act together with others towards common
intentions* ?

Is accumulation of ownership of property facilitating equipotentiality ?
What forms of ownership facilitate equipotentiality ?

Does equipotentiality lead to a feeling of security ?

These are some inter-related questions that lead me to think about
*&quot;intentional
information systems&quot;*.

-

I mentioned some non linear axioms for a post-symbolic spatial language
previously. ( some kind of &quot;meta-cortex&quot; )
I ll reply to Georg in a next email, with some links and some more details.

Such meta-cortex can be a distributed information system that allows such
holoptic visualization.

Yet *I also see other tools, which are closer to what we would currently
call &quot;money&quot;, although defined in a different way, with a different
consciousness*,
which itself could be visualized in the spatial post-symbolic language.

I ll describe such kind of money architecture in the next paragraph.

------

For the moment, I realize a great deal of interdependence is
non-distributed,

as it is specifically dependent on specific information systems
architectures such as the current mainstream form of money. ( I ll add a
description further below ** )

--------

Instead of a system where debt/money is owed from individuals to other
individuals or entities,

*I look forward to &quot;reverse&quot; the way we look at debt.*

Instead of owing debt to others, everyone can choose to owe debt to
intention one wants to support. ( <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention</A>)

Hence, *units could become &quot;requests for support&quot;*

Instead of having a debt monetary system,
one could have a &quot;request for support&quot; monetary system.

If you are interested, I can send you more details.
Although as Michel Bauwens pointed out, many of us are coming out with new
inventions for monetary systems,
and perhaps the MetaCurrency project can serve as an aggregator where we can
compare and be mutually inspired by our system designs.



-------

** Brief reminder / description of current mainstream money story as I see
it :

Many of us seem to set ourselves within the dimensions of interdependence
which are &quot;dependent&quot; on monetary information systems.

I realize that todays monetary information systems are setting most
individuals in society into the consciousness of a dimension of &quot;debt&quot;.  As
debt is created ... money is created...

Money currently seems to be &quot;debt&quot;... to a system with a private banking
system... which promotes accumulation of other peoples debt.

There seems to be a strong meme embedded in western socio culture which
promotes itself through the aim of accumulating other peoples debt in the
interest of our individualistic coercive decision making capacity on
society.

Furthermore, this coercive consciousness dimension is addicted, as there is
interest... that needs to be paid with debt units/money that do not exist
yet... hence the need to continually grow the total debt through creating
new markets ( including speculative markets ).

All this in ... the interest of the ones that have been able to accumulate
and/or hoard other peoples debt... giving them power in a artificially
scarce system of debt exchange units...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Protecting any organization requires we plan for the worst elements.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, 'raw' property ownership is a problem, and we cannot use it in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience (Excessive Capital accumulation for example).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But since owners are traditionally the semi-ultimate controllers of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that property, maybe we could utilize the 'good' portions of ownership
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have a place to stand while applying some restrictions against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'bad' portions of ownership (since owners can always add &quot;Terms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Use&quot; to their own property) in a manner analogous to the way the GNU
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GPL uses Copyright against itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I won't say what I think should be in the &quot;Terms of Use&quot;, since I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already said this part in the past, and will only get in trouble if I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repeat that now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't want to debate (right now) *what* the constraints should be,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm only wondering if such an approach is worthy of consideration as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an avenue of implementation.
