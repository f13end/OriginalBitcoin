<PRE>So the argument goes that technology caused inequality?

How about the rise of graduate management education?  Or the rise of
statistics tracked by compensation consulting firms?

My own view is that the real reason that income inequality has increased is
that the &quot;understanding&quot; of value in processes changed.  We have lawyers,
accountants and management professionals pointing out value contribution and
negotiating who is actually contributing value in processes--and it
generally isn't the exploited worker who is easily replaced by someone in a
poorer country.  That wasn't capitalism...it was professionalism in
management, marketing, law and accounting.

Social norms against high pay for managers fell for numerous complex
reasons--mostly based on new management value theories.  And there was an
argument that capitalists ought NOT to be the winners--shareholders who paid
for their shares didn't do that great compared to managers who made options
to purchase cheap stock and took away big salaries.  Take professional
sports where in the 1950s players barely made a living.  Now they are
lavished in tens of millions of dollars...at the behest of their own
collective bargaining actions.  Owners lose money and own teams for prestige
and fun.  Where is the capitalism there?

The story is complex and to frame it is rather simplistic Marxian terms
isn't helpful in my view; it is just absurd and loses credibility amongst
anyone who actually deals with global business and production systems.

Marx was incredibly wrong.  His ideas have been a source for endless
misery.  Invoking him is a source of lost credibility for the left that
wants some vague utopian state that neither makes any sense nor is it even
remotely feasible.

The discussion here is about voluntary participation in lives of
contribution, service, balance and tension--not some utopian rubbish that
has been tried, failed, rejected and justifiably now ignored by the masses.


If you hate inequality, spread education, advance normative values of
sharing, responsibility and trust.  Work for microcredit systems (which
charge interest) and which work incredibly well.  To say otherwise is sheer
ignorance--like arguing with people who think God is touching their daily
lives--there really isn't anything to say to that level of nihilism and
anti-truth.

If you want to understand development economics, read Bill Easterly and
others who know that you can't do big things through big governments or big
NGOs which will go corrupt and that development works when people are free,
empowered, taught to build their own systems and to not rely on help from
above.  The answers come from the grass roots--not in organizing vast labor
or governmental systems that go corrupt, but in their organizing themselves
into small sustainable processes and systems that advance P2P
opportunities.  That's what P2P is about.  It isn't anti-capitalist.  It
isn't pro-socialist. It is pro living sensibly.  That doesn't have any
systematic economic philosophy.   It is inherently anti-system...anti
hierarchy.  That's why we keep coming back to anarchist mutualist
histories--like Proudhon, like Streeter, like the LETSI people in a much
more modern and viable sense than Proudhon ever was.  With technology, those
systems can lead to happy, reasonably fair and reasonably sustainable
lives--and should.

If you want a mantra to align your life to, then I propose that we don't
organize hierarchies, we should rather organize modes of sharing...P2P.

And, to my mind, spare us the silly Marxian critiques (interest is
inherently evil?--just absurd) which are unworthy of further discussion
because they will never happen and shouldn't happen.

</I>&gt;<i>        I believe the seemingly absurd idealism of the European left is
</I>&gt;<i> useful to the world.  Whether it leads anywhere or just gives fodder to the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Most of the discussions seem better set in 1880 than 2009.  Terms
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;capital&quot; &quot;labor&quot; &quot;management&quot; seem to me to belong with terms like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;steam engine&quot; &quot;railroad&quot; and &quot;factory.&quot;  They aren't even seriously part of
</I>&gt;<i> most people's worlds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        The battlefield today is the mind.  Can its produce be free?  Can
</I>&gt;<i> there be justice in allocating knowledge and the expansion of knowledge?
</I>&gt;<i>  Who wins when knowledge is expanded?  Knowledge isn't a conventional

</I>&gt;<i>                       With respect to this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       &gt; Hundreds of cities and regions and tens of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of people are
</I>&gt;<i>                       &gt; working on monetary issues .. it's a vibrant and
</I>&gt;<i> growing movement ..
</I>&gt;<i>                       &gt; In contrast, POCLAD is just minuscule
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       There is no doubt that the &quot;monetary alternatives&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> movement, for lack
</I>&gt;<i>                       of a better term, is much more vibrant, growing and
</I>&gt;<i> known among
</I>&gt;<i>                       activists than things like POCLAD. I myself
</I>&gt;<i> discovered POCLAD by pure,
</I>&gt;<i>                       pure chance online some years ago. I also have no
</I>&gt;<i> problem, at least
</I>&gt;<i>                       now, to accept your evaluation that POCLAD has much,
</I>&gt;<i> much smaller
</I>&gt;<i>                       possibilities of success than monetary reform. What I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't expect,
</I>&gt;<i>                       and find really interesting, is this assertion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       &gt; and it requires really what the immense majority of
</I>&gt;<i> people will find
</I>&gt;<i>                       &gt; an unacceptable reform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       Regardless, again, of the probability of success and
</I>&gt;<i> of any inherent
</I>&gt;<i>                       flaws in the idea, I am pretty sure that, around
</I>&gt;<i> here, I would find:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       1) much, much less difficulties to explain POCLAD
</I>&gt;<i> proposals than any
</I>&gt;<i>                         money reform scheme passed on this list since when
</I>&gt;<i> I subscribed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       2) (partly due to 1) ) many more supporters of such a
</I>&gt;<i> corporate reform
</I>&gt;<i>                         than of any of those scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       That is, my **feeling** is that if both sets of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals were given
</I>&gt;<i>                       equal coverage in mainstream media (we can dream, can
</I>&gt;<i> we not?), the
</I>&gt;<i>                       majority of non-activists, the &quot;Joe Sixpack&quot; class,
</I>&gt;<i> in American slang,
</I>&gt;<i>                       would go for POCLAD (especially in these times...)
</I>&gt;<i> rather than money
</I>&gt;<i>                       reform which would be, in that context, a much more
</I>&gt;<i> alien concept than
</I>&gt;<i>                       &quot;corporations are bad&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                       So I wonder how much of this feeling depends on where

</I>&gt;<i>                       do list subscribers from other parts of the world
</I>&gt;<i> think? Which of

</I>&gt;<i> (regardless of its
</I>&gt;<i>                       intrinsic value) to Joe Sixpack? Just curious,
