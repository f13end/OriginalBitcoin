<PRE>&lt;And, to my mind, spare us the silly Marxian critiques (interest is
inherently evil?--just absurd) which are unworthy of further discussion
because they will never happen and shouldn't happen. &gt;

Hi Ryan,

just to make a precision, marxists do not critique interest, it's the local
currency movements that do, yes the p2p oriented ones. Interest has been
traditionally rejected by every spiritual tradition before the advent of
capitalism, and is successfully practiced by islamic finance (largely
untouched by the meltdown by the way), and in a modified form (very low
interest), by cooperative banking, also untouched by the meltdown.

The result of what seems to you a shocking heresy which can't happen, is
that, in the midst of the total meltdown of the German and Austrian economy
(the hyperinflation period with dramatic unemployment), the town achieved
nearly full employment. If you read Bernard Lietaer, not a silly marxist
economist but a leading central banker, you will see that nearly every high
growth civilitation was marked by such 'utopian' money (which in other
words, worked very well).

I also disagree on your characterization of Marx. Of course he was
'incredibly wrong' on a number of issues, but also right on others, and
while his ideas were abused by totalitarian states, it also inspired mass
democratic movements without whom the western workers would not have
obtained any of the social gains which we take for granted. There would have
been no welfare state, no New Deal. I wouldn't have been able to go to a
free university with free medical care, but most likely would have worked in
the mines and died at 14. Also, it is rather remarkable that the very elite
you think would be shocked by mentions of Marx, is now rediscovering him
(frontpage of Foreign Policy, jacques attali ...). I would rather say that
for the moment, it is the friedmanites which are fully discredited and have
caused untold harm. So let's dedramatise marx, and consider him
integratively as just one of the sources we may learn something from.

On the other issue, a possible response to the link between technology and
poverty. First of all, the neoliberal period was marked by the spread of
networks in the mass communication era, in other words, the networks were
reserved for the elite. The massification of the internet only started in
1995, significantly co-inciding with the birth of the new social movements
and the beginning of the end of neoliberalism.

This being said, it is to be expected that in the early faces of a
democratisation of technology (think of the gutenberg effect), the initial
effect will be more inequality (people who read gain an advantage over those
that don't, people with internet gain an advantage over those that don't),
but this is a temporary effect, if the social movements are successfull in
spreading the technology to the broader population. This is why universal
broadband is essential.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own view is that the real reason that income inequality has increased is
</I>&gt;<i> that the &quot;understanding&quot; of value in processes changed.  We have lawyers,
</I>&gt;<i> accountants and management professionals pointing out value contribution and

</I>&gt;<i> generally isn't the exploited worker who is easily replaced by someone in a
</I>&gt;<i> poorer country.  That wasn't capitalism...it was professionalism in
</I>&gt;<i> management, marketing, law and accounting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Social norms against high pay for managers fell for numerous complex
</I>&gt;<i> reasons--mostly based on new management value theories.  And there was an
</I>&gt;<i> argument that capitalists ought NOT to be the winners--shareholders who paid
</I>&gt;<i> for their shares didn't do that great compared to managers who made options
</I>&gt;<i> to purchase cheap stock and took away big salaries.  Take professional
</I>&gt;<i> sports where in the 1950s players barely made a living.  Now they are
</I>&gt;<i> lavished in tens of millions of dollars...at the behest of their own
</I>&gt;<i> collective bargaining actions.  Owners lose money and own teams for prestige
</I>&gt;<i> and fun.  Where is the capitalism there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The story is complex and to frame it is rather simplistic Marxian terms
</I>&gt;<i> isn't helpful in my view; it is just absurd and loses credibility amongst
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who actually deals with global business and production systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marx was incredibly wrong.  His ideas have been a source for endless
</I>&gt;<i> misery.  Invoking him is a source of lost credibility for the left that
</I>&gt;<i> wants some vague utopian state that neither makes any sense nor is it even
</I>&gt;<i> remotely feasible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discussion here is about voluntary participation in lives of
</I>&gt;<i> contribution, service, balance and tension--not some utopian rubbish that
</I>&gt;<i> has been tried, failed, rejected and justifiably now ignored by the masses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you hate inequality, spread education, advance normative values of
</I>&gt;<i> sharing, responsibility and trust.  Work for microcredit systems (which
</I>&gt;<i> charge interest) and which work incredibly well.  To say otherwise is sheer
</I>&gt;<i> ignorance--like arguing with people who think God is touching their daily
</I>&gt;<i> lives--there really isn't anything to say to that level of nihilism and
</I>&gt;<i> anti-truth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to understand development economics, read Bill Easterly and
</I>&gt;<i> others who know that you can't do big things through big governments or big
</I>&gt;<i> NGOs which will go corrupt and that development works when people are free,
</I>&gt;<i> empowered, taught to build their own systems and to not rely on help from
</I>&gt;<i> above.  The answers come from the grass roots--not in organizing vast labor
</I>&gt;<i> or governmental systems that go corrupt, but in their organizing themselves
</I>&gt;<i> into small sustainable processes and systems that advance P2P
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities.  That's what P2P is about.  It isn't anti-capitalist.  It
</I>&gt;<i> isn't pro-socialist. It is pro living sensibly.  That doesn't have any
</I>&gt;<i> systematic economic philosophy.   It is inherently anti-system...anti
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy.  That's why we keep coming back to anarchist mutualist
</I>&gt;<i> histories--like Proudhon, like Streeter, like the LETSI people in a much
</I>&gt;<i> more modern and viable sense than Proudhon ever was.  With technology, those
</I>&gt;<i> systems can lead to happy, reasonably fair and reasonably sustainable
</I>&gt;<i> lives--and should.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want a mantra to align your life to, then I propose that we don't
</I>&gt;<i> organize hierarchies, we should rather organize modes of sharing...P2P.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                       would go for POCLAD (especially in these times...)
