<PRE>Dear all,

I am very sorry for using words like &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;very wrong&quot; What I
mean and I mean this genuinely is that that the argument, separate
from its author, is &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;very wrong&quot;

So no offense Marco, sorry if it comes across differently

Having said that, I realize that even arguments have feelings,
separate from the author, so I'll keep my tone in check with respect
to what I see wrong about the argument.

Marc

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend 10x or more each month than a virtual server costs. But why?
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Completely wrong in the context of the commonly understood P2P architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See preceding comments on NOT using static IP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wherever your connect from as long as you have an ID on the P2P
</I>&gt;<i> network you can be routed it to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm suggesting that P2P Email is local to those using a particular P2P
</I>&gt;<i> client but if client developers agree on a standard then it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> global p2p email, since all clients will share the same distributed
</I>&gt;<i> user ID lookup inrastructure (think DNS like mechanism for user IDs so
</I>&gt;<i> instead of email being sent to a domain it is sent to a user ID) and
</I>&gt;<i> same transport protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the problem in this communication is the intuition of a
</I>&gt;<i> software engineer (myself) which is normally matched to the intuition
</I>&gt;<i> of other software engineers when discussing software architecture but
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be readily matched to the intuition of someone who is not
</I>&gt;<i> versed in software architecture and commonly understood patterns both
</I>&gt;<i> at the network and software architecture levels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why it was misunderstood by Marco that I'm suggesting static
</I>&gt;<i> IP addresses be used for routing rather than p2p user IDs which would
</I>&gt;<i> be picked up right away by any person whose background is in network
</I>&gt;<i> and software architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So with p2p email as I'm suggesting you are completely empowered and
</I>&gt;<i> redundancy is &#160;easily achieved in an IPv6 based network and
</I>&gt;<i> established architectural patterns exist and are used in p2p
</I>&gt;<i> architectures in all of the p2p file-sharing apps that exist today.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, email can be picked up from any PC or device running the p2p
</I>&gt;<i> client. It's just like email today except it is based on a p2p network
</I>&gt;<i> rather than centralized or distributed/federated network. The whole
</I>&gt;<i> domain name bullshit needs to go and people need to start accessing
</I>&gt;<i> web pages and email etc by P2P ID not by domain names. You ID is
</I>&gt;<i> everything you need and everything anyone needs to reach you in a true
</I>&gt;<i> p2p network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Key issue for p2p architectures in Ipv6 environment is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> security (it already is in IPv4 but as p2p becomes more widely used
</I>&gt;<i> the security [of each client machine] becomes a bigger issue)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, so this is where the difference and the source of former confusion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is. Let's then restart and sum up a few other things for the benefits of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our readers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To have a permanent email address, send and receive email with it, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generic Joe User needs:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) an email address with a name (left of the @ sign) and a domain part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; (right of the @ sign): &#160;<A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">joe.user at somedomain.com</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) one or more computers (physical or VIRTUAL), directly connected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; 24x7 to the Internet, with FIXED numeric IP address(es), because IP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; packets are routed to IP addresses, NOT domain names. If the IP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; addresses weren't constant, your email correspondents would never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; know what your address will be next week, ie nothing would work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) some software, running on such computer(s) which sends, stores,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; receive email, filters spam, blocks viruses, sends autoresponders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; if needed, etc...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NOTE: 2) and 3) together are, or should include, what is called a Mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eXchange (MX), that is Joe User &quot;email management and routing system&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) an entry into the worldwide Domain Name System telling everybody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; worldwide that the MX for somedomain.com runs at the constant IP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; address(es) mentioned in 2). Without this mapping, NOTHING works,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; because IP packets are routed to IP addresses, NOT domain names.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is the way it works today, and I'm focusing on this. Futuristic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visions are good, but something else and a whole different thread, at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least for me here and now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, let's look again at points 1-4 above. What happens today is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points 2-4 are centrally managed by corporations, who own the domain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the address (gmail, yahoo, everybody else) and provide the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service for money, advertising, etc... or as a business tool in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case of work email addresses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here we all agree that this is bad: privacy concerns, lack of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> robustness, lack of flexibility, non standard configurations, no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rights to change the terms of services, etc...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Starting from this common ground, Marc Fawzi says IPv6 will make p2p
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email as defined above possible, because it will make available enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> static IP addresses that every individual will be able to do points
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2-4 directly without technical complications impossible to avoid today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this vision, everybody will be able to associate to his static IPv6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address to his own personal computers and run on those personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computers a new generation of email software integrating all I listed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in 3) and then some, without intermediaries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All the comments from Marc about NAT, bypassing firewalls etc... that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should disappear with the switch from IPv4 to IPv6 come from the fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *) he suggests or envisions that people could and should use their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; everyday (mobile) computers for point 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *) but (and he's right on this) with IPv4 (today) these computers are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; routinely assigned &quot;bogus&quot; IP addresses which are very hard, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; impossible, to make them &quot;look&quot; as static, ie suitable for email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; routing. In other words, with IPv4 it's impossible to run your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; email from your own personal computer. I agree on this, of course.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, I agree that everybody taking full control of their own email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> management is definitely a good thing. What I say is simply:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) running the system on one's home or mobile computers, rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; buying/renting for this very purpose a virtual server in a reliable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; datacenter is such a bad idea for so many technical and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; reasons from social to environmental, reasons which DON'T change at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; all whatever version of IP is used, that I don't think I'll ever do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; it myself, nor I recommend it to anybody who uses email for more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; than casual chat.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) developing new software which would overcome all the problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; created by using a cheap laptop as MX, and be simple to use is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; very big task
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) points 2-4 can be already done by individuals with IPv4 and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; existing software today. They're exactly what I, an individual, am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; already doing. What is missing to make worldwide p2p email is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &quot;only&quot;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;- laws that don't make this illegal or affordable only by big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;corporations, maybe an ICANN reform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;- ISPs selling &quot;individual MX virtual servers&quot; with a GUI which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;spares non geeks from all the manual configuration work I had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;to do by hand. No need for more server or client software,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;what exists is adequate, even if it should always be improved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;- enough IP addresses for everybody to have one to associate to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;their &quot;individual MX virtual server&quot; package.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but last point is exactly the first thing I said yesterday: the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason I see why IPv6 should ever enter this picture is to have enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numeric fixed addresses. Because every other problem caused by IPv4,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is getting rid of NAT, working through ISPs or corporate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firewalls,etc... is true but irrelevant compared to the cons of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running a server from a personal computer. As I wrote yesterday:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Think Michel's laptop. Having a personal (= the one you carry with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you, keep at home etc... ) cheap computer being the single point of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> routing and failure of your communications means that if it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stolen, drenched with coffee, blasted by electrical charges or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> breaks in any other way you're really toast. It means that if you go
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for a few days without broadband email to you gets bounced, because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there's no other computer able to store it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the best case, it means that you MUST carry that object along
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with you every moment of your life, you can't ask a friend &quot;let me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> check my email, please&quot; A nightmare.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theoretically yes, one could introduce new protocols to add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redundancy, security and robustness to such a scenario, or,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individually, buy server-class hardware, UPS for backup power,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subscribe to two or more ISPs for redundant connectivity, that is
