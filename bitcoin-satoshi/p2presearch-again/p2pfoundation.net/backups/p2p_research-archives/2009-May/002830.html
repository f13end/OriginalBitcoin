<PRE>I must say this has become incomprehensible to me.

Stefan, as I understand it, seems to want to abandon certain concepts of
property, but I'm not sure.  I really wish someone would try a position
paper for oekonux that expresses the core ideas in any language in
straightforward terms.  For now, I have no idea what you are talking about.
It appears to be nonsense to me, at least.  I want to be wrong about that,
but I cannot gather enough of the basic ideas for any of it to make sense.

&gt;<i> Hi Michel!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I am really upset!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 days ago Michel Bauwens wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read the sentence again, use your brain,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find it ludicrous that *you* ask *me* to use my brain. Obviously you
</I>&gt;<i> stated nonsense and now *I* shall use my brain? COME ON!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and use the full context of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dialogue to understand that interests makes it indeed interesting to keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your money in the  bank.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you give money to the bank then you do **NOT** keep it. This very
</I>&gt;<i> sentence you wrote just makes no sense. It's nonsense again. And it's
</I>&gt;<i> propaganda again because it is only said this way to invoke a feeling
</I>&gt;<i> of injustice in simple-minded people. It hides facts to make a certain
</I>&gt;<i> ideology look more logical and &quot;just&quot;. It may not be your intention -
</I>&gt;<i> and frankly I hope it is not your intention. But it is the intention
</I>&gt;<i> of those you have this propaganda from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you give your money to the bank in fact you may get your money back
</I>&gt;<i> *under certain conditions* being part of a contract. If you are in bad
</I>&gt;<i> luck you may even not get it back at all, however - as people learned
</I>&gt;<i> during the latest financial crisis once again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I *keep* my money there is no such risk. I just keep it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very easy to see that there is a major difference here. In fact
</I>&gt;<i> it is the difference between a pre-capitalist fortune keeper - who
</I>&gt;<i> really keeps her fortune - and a capitalist - who applies her fortune
</I>&gt;<i> by giving it to others to make profit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Explain to me how you would get interest under your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cushion, I would be very very curious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, it was *your* claim that keeping money raises interest. If this
</I>&gt;<i> would be true then I can keep it under my cushion with the same
</I>&gt;<i> effect. I'm just taking your statements serious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Taking statements serious is a simple necessity in a scientific
</I>&gt;<i> approach. To think about what a statement actually means is a very
</I>&gt;<i> simple test of an assumption against reality. It is basic scientific
</I>&gt;<i> work - by which you are obviously shocked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm trying to put the conflict behind,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no conflict with you. To me all this feels very much like
</I>&gt;<i> shadow boxing on your side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but if you descend to such levels of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ridiculousness, it makes it very difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really sorry Michel, but that it all but ridiculous. The question
</I>&gt;<i> whether you can keep your money or need to give it to someone else -
</I>&gt;<i> usually mediated by a bank but also in the form of shares - to get
</I>&gt;<i> interest is the all-or-nothing question here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please, let's put that behind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are free to correct your statements so they make sense and - at
</I>&gt;<i> best - match the observable reality. It would be far better than to
</I>&gt;<i> leave the community just because someone says you are preaching
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frankly I'm curious how long it will take that you at least agree that
</I>&gt;<i> you can *not keep* your money and get interest for it. In science that
</I>&gt;<i> would be simply to recognize the observable reality and modify your
</I>&gt;<i> basic assumption according to it. As you wrote above you are still not
</I>&gt;<i> ready to modify your basic assumption - though you are now replacing
</I>&gt;<i> your basic assumption with sentences which are inherently
</I>&gt;<i> contradictory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a scientific approach the next step would be to question what
</I>&gt;<i> happens with the money you just gave to others. That would be the
</I>&gt;<i> research step. And it would be easy because it is well-known that
</I>&gt;<i> banks give money to capitalists in the form of credit. In turn the
</I>&gt;<i> capitalists then apply it to labor force and machinery to produce
</I>&gt;<i> products they can sell for a higher price than they had themselves for
</I>&gt;<i> the input. The logical conclusion is that interest is a share of the
</I>&gt;<i> profit of a capitalist. The amount of interest is directly coupled to
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of expected profit and the risk involved to actually make
</I>&gt;<i> this profit [1]_. In other words: What you are trying to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> with your [named above] stuff is what actually happens in capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> all the time. It's in fact the very core of capitalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .. [1] Of course in a fully expanded exchange system at the end of its
</I>&gt;<i>       life cycle like contemporary capitalism it is a bit more
</I>&gt;<i>       difficult. It's a interesting task to research that. But the
</I>&gt;<i>       general principle stays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, Christian and others explained all that over and over again and it
</I>&gt;<i> is really not hard to understand. In fact it needs no theory at all.
</I>&gt;<i> It's all observable reality. But you constantly ignore this. Feel
</I>&gt;<i> free. But don't be shocked if others call this nonsense or - when
</I>&gt;<i> combined with an attempt to evoke certain feelings in simple-minded
</I>&gt;<i> persons - even propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                                                Gr&#252;&#223;e
