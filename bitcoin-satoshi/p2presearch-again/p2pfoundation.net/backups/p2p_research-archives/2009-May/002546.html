<PRE>Is anyone making a claim that P2P answers all questions?  I don't see it as
an exclusive or ideal worldview.  It is a normative set of values that is
highly tolerant of other systems.  I might even go so far as to say the P2P
needs competing markets, but that might not be right.

I see the counter arguments that Michael Albert puts forward as of two
veins: 1) It isn't anything new or unique, and 2) It doesn't solve all the
problems of life.  Neither of those is very troubling to me, though I do
disagree with many of his points which I think Michel rebutted well.

P2P is not an idealistic control-all solution--though it may be an economic
system--it isn't exclusive.  It is a normative package for approaching
certain social problems.

Whether it is new or not seems particularly uninteresting because the point
is not exclusionary innovation in a market (or political) sense; the point
is to find sustainable ways of living and allocating resources efficiently.


I would argue that trust and sharing are extremely efficient if the problem
of free-riders can be adequately policed.  P2P minimizes policing by
maximizing cultures of trust and sharing with some necessary infrastructure
to protect against rogue parties (e.g. a copyleft license).

</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;You say peer to peer is &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; processes whereby &#8220;agents in a
</I>&gt;<i> distributed network&#8230;freely engage in common pursuits&#8221;  and &#8220;permissionlessly
</I>&gt;<i> undertake actions and relations.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn&#8217;t any club has this character? &#8220;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peer production is easiest to implement and practice in conditions where
</I>&gt;<i> the costs of reproduction are marginal. This includes content, software,
</I>&gt;<i> designs. But it is very important that there is no a priori filtering, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> that you do not have to ask permission to add your contribution. In most
</I>&gt;<i> newspapers for example, you can only write if your editor has asked you to
</I>&gt;<i> do so, and if he then also accepts your article. By contrast, peer-produced
</I>&gt;<i> citizen journalism, would accept your contributions, and would filter for
</I>&gt;<i> excellence and quality &#8216;a posteriori&#8217; after the fact. The overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> majority of NGO&#8217;s for example, would not allow this permissionless
</I>&gt;<i> production of content. So it pretty much depends on the rules of the club:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) can anyone participate (design for inclusion); 2) is the process of
</I>&gt;<i> filtering participatory and a posteriori; 3) is the result available to all
</I>&gt;<i> without exception. If the 3 conditions are met, we do indeed have peer
</I>&gt;<i> production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;If some group produces outputs that require inputs, it would have to get
</I>&gt;<i> the inputs. It would have to get the labor. People could say no.
</I>&gt;<i> Permissions, and perhaps acquisitions, are involved. More, peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be only about undertaking joint ventures that have no significant
</I>&gt;<i> costs. Is that right?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The input must indeed be open and free, and obviously, this works only
</I>&gt;<i> where communication, coordination, and reproduction costs are marginal, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> in the world of immaterial production. But please note: everything that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be physically produced, and therefore needs cost-recovery
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms, has a design phase. That design phase is &#8216;immaterial&#8217; (in the
</I>&gt;<i> sense we understand it), and therefore, can be peer produced. Hence, it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes easy to imagine, and this is already practiced (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Product_Hacking">http://p2pfoundation.net/Product_Hacking</A>) to combine an open design
</I>&gt;<i> process, with a different mechanism for physical production. You therefore
</I>&gt;<i> could combine this &#8216;peer to peer&#8217; (or in other words, Marx&#8217;s definition of
</I>&gt;<i> communism as last phase of history) in the design phase, with say, a
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative, for the production phase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a peer to peer design phase, then these designers start
</I>&gt;<i> conceiving of producing the &#8216;product&#8217; quite differently, in ways that are
</I>&gt;<i> modular, etc&#8230; So the end effect is to have more distributed physical
</I>&gt;<i> production infrastructures, which are more compatible with the peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> logic of the design process, since they lower the cost of entry for physical
</I>&gt;<i> machinery, and help to decentralize and distribute capital requirements,
</I>&gt;<i> reversing the logic of the capital system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I wonder, what are the virtues that peer to peer is trying to capture?
</I>&gt;<i> What are the gains from the choices? If we could enumerate those gains, most
</I>&gt;<i> broadly, shouldn&#8217;t we then see if we can we have the gains not only for
</I>&gt;<i> inexpensive and essentially volunteer efforts, but also for all other
</I>&gt;<i> economic activity?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peer to peer combines the ability for everyone to volunteer his passionate
</I>&gt;<i> contributions (equipotentiality, see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Equipotentiality">http://p2pfoundation.net/Equipotentiality</A>), to do so in an environment
</I>&gt;<i> that does not necessitate hierarchical fiats, and where the results can be
</I>&gt;<i> equally shared by all. Such production, because it relies on the most
</I>&gt;<i> creative non-coerced intrinsic motivation, leads to hyperproductivity, and a
</I>&gt;<i> striving for absolute quality, which can not be matched by purely commercial
</I>&gt;<i> players relying on closed intellectual property. Most of the time, because
</I>&gt;<i> of the issue you correctly described above, i.e. the different logics
</I>&gt;<i> applying to immaterial vs. material production, a hybrid and cooperative
</I>&gt;<i> logic emerges combining the open design communities, a nonprofit
</I>&gt;<i> (&#8216;for-benefit&#8217;) managing the infrastructure of cooperation, and a ecology of
</I>&gt;<i> businesses producing scarce added value for the market.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Apparently to call a project peer to peer its outputs have to be
</I>&gt;<i> universally available but I am not sure what that means. A group writing
</I>&gt;<i> essays and displaying them at no cost to readers would seem to meet your
</I>&gt;<i> condition. But what about a group producing food, say, or violins, or
</I>&gt;<i> something else? On two counts it would seem to fail to meet your definition.
</I>&gt;<i> First, the products wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone, clearly. Second, the inputs
</I>&gt;<i> would be expensive, which implies permissions, acquisitions, etc.  Is this
</I>&gt;<i> correct?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is correct. Typically, as in the Arduino circuit boards, or your
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical violin, the violin would be a market product, exchanged for
</I>&gt;<i> money, but the design would be available to all, so any other company would
</I>&gt;<i> also be free to produce it. One of the side effects of this is to destroy
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly rent on artificial scarcity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;What precisely are the virtues of peer to peer that you like? More, can we
</I>&gt;<i> preserve those virtues even when production involves serious costs and
</I>&gt;<i> generates outputs that are not universal? If so, what would it require? If
</I>&gt;<i> not, why not?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As said above, peer production only works for immaterial production, but
</I>&gt;<i> can be associated with physical production. Ideally, peer communities are
</I>&gt;<i> strong enough to work with businesses that are closer in ethical values and
</I>&gt;<i> practices. This is already happening in the existing hybrid practices. They
</I>&gt;<i> can also create their own, such as for example coops, or parecon-inspired
</I>&gt;<i> businesses.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;You say &#8220;peer to peer processes are emerging in literally every cranny of
</I>&gt;<i> social life,&#8221; but unless I am missing something it seems to me they have
</I>&gt;<i> been with us for centuries &#8211; unless you make the conditions very stringent.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that new  information technologies have opened a new domain to
</I>&gt;<i> peer to peer &#8211; the production and distribution of information &#8211; but the
</I>&gt;<i> technology is what seems new, not the peer to peer activity per se &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> voluntarism, self determination, etc. Am I wrong about that?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you are correct. P2P, or in technical terms (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Relational_Model_Typology_-_Fiske">http://p2pfoundation.net/Relational_Model_Typology_-_Fiske</A>), communal
</I>&gt;<i> shareholding, has always existed, but was limited in time and space to small
</I>&gt;<i> groups. Only now can these small group dynamic scale to the global level
</I>&gt;<i> through global coordination. Of the four human intersubjectivities and ways
</I>&gt;<i> of creating value (the three others being Equality Matching = gift economy ;
</I>&gt;<i> Authority Matching = Hierarchical Allocation; and Market Pricing =
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism), it is the only form that has never really been dominant. With
</I>&gt;<i> the affordances of the internet, peer to peer technologies, and other
</I>&gt;<i> distributed infrastructures, what changes is that it can not only create
</I>&gt;<i> very complex social artefacts, but can become a universal way of creating
</I>&gt;<i> common value, and could even be the dominant logic of a new political
</I>&gt;<i> economy/civilization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;After your introduction to peer to peer, you get more precise with three
</I>&gt;<i> conditions. To me, however, the conditions imply that peer to peer is about
</I>&gt;<i> production of a common resource, only. Why is that? Why do you want to limit
</I>&gt;<i> your attention to only production of public goods? Is it really true that
</I>&gt;<i> only the production of public goods production can embody the virtues &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> whatever they turn out to be once listed &#8211; of peer to peer? Why not all
</I>&gt;<i> types of production?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For peer to peer to expand to all types of production, we need to solve to
</I>&gt;<i> issue of cost recovery for physical production. This may either never be
</I>&gt;<i> fully attained, or may require a long transitional period. The best option
</I>&gt;<i> therefore is to think of peer to peer in terms of a pluralist economy.
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine that innovation and creation becomes a matter of global open design
</I>&gt;<i> groups, this being the core of value creation; around this core, you have
</I>&gt;<i> coops, parecon groups, gift economies, fair trade and non-capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> markets, etc&#8230; To the degree that we can design more abundance (capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> markets being designed to create more and more scarcity), peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> logics of voluntary contributions and universal availability can expand to
</I>&gt;<i> more and more aspects of society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Does the fact that workers agree to participate of their own accord (even
</I>&gt;<i> if in very constrained settings) and that the firm happens to produce
</I>&gt;<i> information that it in turn makes available free &#8211; say via a giant web site,
</I>&gt;<i> or something &#8211; though it then also sells ads to finance it all, qualify as
</I>&gt;<i> peer to peer production?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the income is conditional on production, it&#8217;s not peer to peer, even if
</I>&gt;<i> the result is freely available. You can have a commons as outpout, without
</I>&gt;<i> p2p as input and process. And you can have p2p input, but with the result
</I>&gt;<i> being available only for sale. So the 3 conditions need to be met. In a
</I>&gt;<i> capitalist context of courses, workers are never really free in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> work contracts, since they cannot survive without one. It is important to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish the commons mode of peer production, where there is a common
</I>&gt;<i> goal, from the sharing sites owned by corporate platforms.  In this case,
</I>&gt;<i> you have a dual logic: individuals creating content for universal
</I>&gt;<i> availability in a p2p-related way, while companies are selling the
</I>&gt;<i> aggregated attention to the advertising marketplace. It&#8217;s a hybrid form,
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentalized by capital. This creates a new type of social conflict,
</I>&gt;<i> between the interest of the community, and the interest of the platform. But
</I>&gt;<i> of interest is the greater opportunity for sharing, and that a sector of
</I>&gt;<i> capital is abandoning its reliance on Intellectual Protection. Historically,
</I>&gt;<i> modes of production have only changed, when there was a congruent change
</I>&gt;<i> both from the value-creating classes and the value-extracting classes. The
</I>&gt;<i> emergence of netarchical capitalism, as that sector of capital which enables
</I>&gt;<i> and empowers &#8216;sharing&#8217; to occur&#8217; can therefore be seen as a partially
</I>&gt;<i> positive development.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;What if a bunch of programmers create a project to produce a new program,

</I>&gt;<i> to clean their workplace, to cook their food, to shop for them. They pay for
</I>&gt;<i> the computers and their upkeep, for the electricity, etc. They get funds for

</I>&gt;<i> Michael Albert writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Nearly everything produced and used in production is scarce in the very
</I>&gt;<i> precise sense that if it wasn&#8217;t&#8217; used for the chosen purpose, something else
</I>&gt;<i> could have been done with it, instead. There is an opportunity cost for
</I>&gt;<i> labor, resources, materials, time, etc. This is a timeless fact of life.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no avoiding that last part but allocating assets to some ends
</I>&gt;<i> instead of others can be done consistent with worthy values and assessments
</I>&gt;<i> of full social and ecological implications, or can be done via methods that
</I>&gt;<i> trample worthy values and utilize warped valuations &#8230; We should want to have
</I>&gt;<i> those virtues present throughout and economy and society, rather than only
</I>&gt;<i> for volunteer production of public goods.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I absolutely agree with you that we should extend the virtues of openness,
</I>&gt;<i> freedom, participation, the common good, equality etc.. The question is how
</I>&gt;<i> that can be done. As you say, scarcity is everywhere. But scarcity &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> abundance sit on a continuum, and the present system has it backwards: it
</I>&gt;<i> considers naturally scarce physical resources to be infinite, and wants to
</I>&gt;<i> make abundance naturally scarce. So we need to reverse it. Most abundance is
</I>&gt;<i> available in the world of immaterial production, where p2p now naturally
</I>&gt;<i> occurs, because we have a largely socialized infrastructure. Let&#8217;s keep it
</I>&gt;<i> and extend it. Next, we do what we can so that individuals can aggregate as
</I>&gt;<i> freely as they can in the physical sphere, by creating distributed
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures. If we have open designs, and easier access to capital
</I>&gt;<i> goods, we can create a cooperative economy. This is however, not merely a
</I>&gt;<i> technical or economic question, but a political question. My expectation is
</I>&gt;<i> that the peer to peer movements will naturally evolve from transgressive
</I>&gt;<i> behavior (say filesharing), to constructive behavior (say the General Public
</I>&gt;<i> License), to practices which challenge the existing institutional setup and

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;When you say societal change requires at least &#8220;a sizeable section of the
</I>&gt;<i> former ruling structure morphing to the new mode&#8221; I think it is an
</I>&gt;<i> understatement, and yet it also concerns me. All of the old rulers exist in
</I>&gt;<i> the new system, and thus must by definition morph into operating in light of
</I>&gt;<i> the new system&#8217;s norms and structures. This is a truism, no? But when you
</I>&gt;<i> say it is happening with peer to peer now, I have concerns about that &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> because the old elite&#8217;s motives remain capitalist and govern their
</I>&gt;<i> willingness to exploit peer to peer.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the concern, but that is the reality of a class society, that
</I>&gt;<i> different social groups protect their interest first. So, as peer producing
</I>&gt;<i> communities seek to extend their sustainability and possibilities, so
</I>&gt;<i> capital seeks to profit from it. The historical precedents show us that the
</I>&gt;<i> old order first seeks to use the new mode to bolster its own logic,
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure and institutions, while being in the end overcome by it.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is how the transition occurred from slavery to serfdom, and from feudalism
</I>&gt;<i> to capitalism, and why I expect the same process to apply to the transition
</I>&gt;<i> to a peer to peer society. Obviously, where I come from, and the work of the
</I>&gt;<i> P2P Foundation is dedicated to it, is to advance on the way to scenario one.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is also the case that netarchical capital does a number of
</I>&gt;<i> things that are in our interest as well, and so they can both be partial
</I>&gt;<i> allies and partial enemies. Google is a good example. When it fights for
</I>&gt;<i> open spectrum in Congress, it&#8217;s an ally, when it abuses our personal data,
</I>&gt;<i> it&#8217;s an enemy. The leaning of peer to peer advocates will be on a broad
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum of positions. People like Lawrence Lessig are happy with a liberal
</I>&gt;<i> economy for example, and people like Yochai Benkler, see peer production as
</I>&gt;<i> an adjunct to the market. I see it as an alternative, a &#8216;conditional
</I>&gt;<i> inevitability&#8217; that needs to be fought for.

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The weakness of what has been called socialism, or 20th century socialism,
</I>&gt;<i> or what I tend to call coordinatorism, was certainly not its inferior
</I>&gt;<i> productive capacity &#8211; and since when is maximizing output our desideratum
</I>&gt;<i> for judging societies, in any event even if it were inferior on that axis -
</I>&gt;<i> but, instead, its social organization, class hierarchy, authoritarianism,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I assume we agree about that.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peer production is hyperproductive not just in terms of production, but
</I>&gt;<i> politically in terms of participation and democracy, and the universal
</I>&gt;<i> availability of its production as well. &#8216;Really existing&#8217; socialism was
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian and had uneven distribution. As a production alternative, it
</I>&gt;<i> did not prove to be more productive in the long run, while capitalism proved
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with some limited forms of democracy. But P2P retains the high
</I>&gt;<i> productivity, introduces democracy in production and all areas of social
</I>&gt;<i> life, and allows anyone to profit from its realizations.

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Why promote what purports to be a humane alternative to capitalism as a
</I>&gt;<i> means of resuscitating a horrendously horrible capitalist system? But more,
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to see how peer to peer points toward a new &#8220;social compact&#8221; in
</I>&gt;<i> your eyes, or in the eyes of its advocates, and am having trouble with that.
</I>&gt;<i> For me, I think it certainly could &#8211; for example by highlighting as part of
</I>&gt;<i> its ethos and aims the desirability of self management and thus
</I>&gt;<i> classlessness, and of cooperative and solidaritous negotiation of
</I>&gt;<i> allocation, equitable remuneration, etc.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> So again, I wonder which it is?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You and I may find capitalism to be &#8216;horrendously horrible&#8217; (I actually
</I>&gt;<i> would have to qualify that statement, but let&#8217;s pass it for this time), but
</I>&gt;<i> most people in the world disagree, and two hundred years of rhetoric and
</I>&gt;<i> social struggle haven&#8217;t abolished it. (I also do not believe classlessness
</I>&gt;<i> is a realistic possibility in conditions of objective or perceived
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity.) So my view is: as we are seeing post-capitalist processes
</I>&gt;<i> emerging, how do we extend them as much as we can. I&#8217;m not interested one
</I>&gt;<i> bit in anti-capitalist rhetoric, only in actions which allow us to go beyond
</I>&gt;<i> commodity production. For that, we strengthen our peer producing
</I>&gt;<i> communities, build our institutions, do what we can to promote distributed
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures in every area we can, and create a social movement which can
</I>&gt;<i> successfully defend our practices, and hopefully one day, remove
</I>&gt;<i> constraining institutions.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m not ignoring them at all. Within its sphere of success, peer production
</I>&gt;<i> has actually successfully addresses decision-making structures (peer

</I>&gt;<i> For physical production, they are the central concern and I&#8217;m continuously,
