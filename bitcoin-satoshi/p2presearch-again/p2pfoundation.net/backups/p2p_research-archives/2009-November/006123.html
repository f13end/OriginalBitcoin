<PRE>Hi franz,

thanks for the update, but please note we already had a link here
<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Peer_2_Peer_University">http://p2pfoundation.net/Peer_2_Peer_University</A>

concerning your critique of the peer review journal project,

yes, it seems this project is going to be academically oriented, and it took
a lot of processing time for the group behind it, which is why I also bailed
out of it, as you may have noticed. I consider the p2p wiki to be exactly
that, a goal oriented research project, and though it may not be academic,
the 9 million page views and multiple usages by researchers show it is
useful, even if very few people are working on it ...

I think we have to respect a plurality of visions, here, the academics in
the journal, naturally reflect their own priorities, including that of
surviving  in their careers, and I don't want to judge them on that. I ask
myself is it better to have academic journals without p2p, or to have at
least some of our voices heard ... I prefer the latter and so I still
rejoice in that initiative.

I'm not clear on how much innovative p2p procedures they have included in
this project, since I haven't followed it up lately, but perhaps mathieu,
stefan and athina and other participants found some innovative solutions?

&gt;<i> Dear all,

</I>&gt;<i> I dont know if that was already subject here, but I did not find an entry

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sorry if it was already covered. I could not find out because the current

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its very interesting that there is already a certain degree of support for

</I>&gt;<i> similar endavours.

</I>&gt;<i> I am not reading this list (p2p research) too often due to overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> other stuff and lack of time, but I use the opportunity to give a short
</I>&gt;<i> report and account on whats happening here in Vienna. I can relate to the
</I>&gt;<i> Idea of P2PUniversity in manifold ways. One is that the current academic
</I>&gt;<i> system is in a deep crisis which has only been exposed by the Bologna
</I>&gt;<i> reforms. Its a historical coincidence that the wave of global student
</I>&gt;<i> protests has started here in Vienna, but this gave me a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities to get some reality check on this crisis. Together with
</I>&gt;<i> Andreas Exner and others I intervened with a joint workshop in the
</I>&gt;<i> Auditorium Maximum with the participation of about 100 students on a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Solidarity Economy of the University&quot;. We are just at the beginning of a
</I>&gt;<i> process here discussing how academic structures can be broken up
</I>&gt;<i> (especially concerning breaking the wall to adult education) and turned
</I>&gt;<i> into a living element of social self-organisation and social self-support,
</I>&gt;<i> forming a joint blog at <A HREF="http://massenuni.blogsport.de/">http://massenuni.blogsport.de</A> (in German).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I can also report that our own little &quot;university&quot; endavour is
</I>&gt;<i> also moving forward to a certain degree; we have lots of participation
</I>&gt;<i> interest in our small workshop on VideoBridging and the Virtual University
</I>&gt;<i> of the Villages.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi?VideoBridge/GrundtvigWorkshop">http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi?VideoBridge/GrundtvigWorkshop</A> &quot;Streaming,
</I>&gt;<i> Sharing and Learning (SSL) &#8211; The options for and the use of Interactive
</I>&gt;<i> Digital Video over long distances in adult education&quot;.  The selection
</I>&gt;<i> process is almost done. I never dared to dream that we would have such
</I>&gt;<i> demand. People sacrifice almost 2 weeks of their precious time for that,
</I>&gt;<i> We managed to pull together a dream team, a fantastic group. look here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi?VideoBridge/GrundtvigWorkshop/Participants">http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi?VideoBridge/GrundtvigWorkshop/Participants</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  (in progress)   We will most likely be able to arrange a distributed
</I>&gt;<i> stream on January the 25th 6 pm afternoon Vienna time so we can practicly
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrate what we are talking about. Help in all form is welcome; we
</I>&gt;<i> will ourselves create a learning community on NING, videobridge.ning.com
</I>&gt;<i> to capture the incredible wealth of informations and elements, patterns
</I>&gt;<i> and processes involved. The most important element of this will be our
</I>&gt;<i> coming together in the January Workshop which I hope will take the form of
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;sprint&quot; producing a qunatum and quality leap of learning  materials.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone who wants to join the external circle is very welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently had an argument with a colleague who is a full-time academic
</I>&gt;<i> researcher and it led to bitter scision about the role of academic and
</I>&gt;<i> non-academic research. I dont go into details, but basically I see a
</I>&gt;<i> danger of the move towards the formal academic sector and its procedures
</I>&gt;<i> in the P2P-Oekonux world leaving out and structurally disregarding
</I>&gt;<i> goal-oriented, construction oriented research work. Lots of time is spent
</I>&gt;<i> on the construction of peer reviewed journals, on procedures of
</I>&gt;<i> recognition, favoring an individualistic monadic and feuilletonistic style
</I>&gt;<i> of publication and activity, whilst the construction and improvement of
</I>&gt;<i> joint knowledge sources is getting out of focus. I dont know if this is
</I>&gt;<i> really a healthy development, all I can say is that it has had a deep
</I>&gt;<i> impact on communication structures and intensities already. More than ever
</I>&gt;<i> before I begin to feel the truth of Marx eleventh theses on Feuerbach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The academic form of science was a limiting form for me personally which
</I>&gt;<i> made me drop out of academic life - just to discover that I went out of
</I>&gt;<i> the frying pan into the fire. To discover that without the proper
</I>&gt;<i> resources (and time is the most valuable one) any form of research is
</I>&gt;<i> doomed. This weeek we are going to have the 12th General assembly of GIVE,
</I>&gt;<i> the research association that I formed in 1998 as a &quot;bootstrap community&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to explore, design and support the emergent new lifeforms that combine
</I>&gt;<i> physical proximity and embeddedness with global connection and
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation. GIVE was also meant to practically represent an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to the dominant form of academic research, embedding research in practise
</I>&gt;<i> of activists and stakeholders of the village building process. In a way, I
</I>&gt;<i> think the idea is still  very good - whilst in reality I have not been
</I>&gt;<i> able to show very much of results other than Dorfwiki, a relatively
</I>&gt;<i> confusing and unreadable collection of some parallel efforts to pursue
</I>&gt;<i> isolated themes. So thats the downside of the process, which also led to
</I>&gt;<i> disappointments and dissolution of friendships. Its not primarily a
</I>&gt;<i> personal problem, its also a problem of funding and recognition, of time
</I>&gt;<i> and resources. The &quot;deep process&quot; of holding together an innovative and
</I>&gt;<i> exploring community of practise can paradoxically only be done by
</I>&gt;<i> theoreticians; but this paradox is in no way socially recognized - yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I had these associations, but if we team up with P2P university I
</I>&gt;<i> think it would be a logical step.
