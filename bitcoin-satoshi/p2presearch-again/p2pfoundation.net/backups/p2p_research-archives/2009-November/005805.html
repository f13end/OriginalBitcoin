</I>&gt;<i> an analogy:  when you continue to sit in my living room after I tell

</I>&gt;<i>  i.e., it assumes that a given territory IS indeed &quot;its&quot; territory.
</I>&gt;<i> This is what market anarchists dispute.   It's quite possible for
</I>&gt;<i> common property to exist, as in the Russian mir, the medieval
</I>&gt;<i> open-field system, etc.  But there must be some material basis for the
</I>&gt;<i> right of a real, concrete group of people to claim ownership of such
</I>&gt;<i> commons--not just the claim of some entity to &quot;represent&quot; all the
</I>&gt;<i> people within some geographical area, and thereby to have some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> legislative police power over the entire population within that area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
There's another way the analogy fails. A country is not a house. :-)

More seriously, in a country one has lots of places to go where the state 
(in a democracy, in theory) is mostly not supposed to intrude, like your own 
house. So, it's like a house where you have your own private room the owner 
agrees not to usually come into.

Also, in a country, in theory, citizens help define the laws. So, it's like 
a house with a rules committee, not a single dictator/owner.

But with all that said, can state power in some areas of life be too strong 
to be healthy? Sure. It's that Manuel de Landa meshwork hierarchy balance thing.
   <A HREF="http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/meshwork.htm">http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/meshwork.htm</A>

See also, though it ignores the value of community and some other good stuff 
including Alfie Kohn's Case Against Competition:
   &quot;(Propertarian) Libertarianism: Marxism of the Right&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/</A>

There are other forms of libertarianism though. Noam Chomsky identifies 
himself as a libertarian socialist.
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism</A>
&quot;Libertarian socialism (sometimes called socialist anarchism,[1][2] and 
sometimes left libertarianism[3][4]) is a group of political philosophies 
that aspire to create a society without political, economic, or social 
hierarchies, i.e. a society in which all violent or coercive institutions 
would be dissolved, and in their place every person would have free, equal 
access to the tools of information and production.[5]&quot;

But, based on Manuel de Landa, that's seems like a theoretical 
impossibility. A shared culture is itself a sort of hierarchical 
institution, as is a constitution, as is shared standards, and so on. Even 
informal agreements about the commons are a sort of hierarchical thing in 
some sense. Socially it may not feel like a hierarchy; Manuel de Landa is 
talking more conceptually.

One can also see things along a fire/ice or order/chaos axis. But it is 
different than that in the sense that fire and ice can coexist, or systems 
can have highly ordered parts and very chaotic parts, all at the same time.
