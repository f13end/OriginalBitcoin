founder&#8217;s reputation-as-currency start-up? via Futurismic by Paul Raven
on 11/16/09

Oh, to be a CEO of a tech start-up&#8230; they can get bored of their
projects even faster than the public can, y&#8217;know. Actually, that&#8217;s a
little unfair &#8211; Philip Rosedale, the man behind Linden Lab, hasn&#8217;t lost
interest in Second life so much as he&#8217;s looking for a new fish to fry
with his new company, LoveMachine Inc. [image by Mrs. Bones]

What does LoveMachine do? Apparently it&#8217;s developing a system of the
same name that was used by Linden Lab as a points-based incentive tool:

Linden employees gave and received &#8220;love&#8221; for a job well done. If an
employee was well-received amongst his or her peers, their accumulated
love currency was redeemable for a cash bonus at the end of the month.
Similar to social capital systems like Whuffie Bank, it appears that
LoveMachine may become a reputation currency system for businesses.

Interesting to see another outfit chasing after reputation economies as
a potential business model&#8230; and restricting such a system to the
limited and manageable confines of discreet organisations makes sense,
as closed economies are inherently easier to manage. I expect they&#8217;ve
heeded Bruce Schneier&#8217;s advice on reputation economies, too:

You&#8217;ve all experienced a reputation economy: restaurants. Some
restaurants have a good reputation, and are filled with regulars. When
restaurants get a bad reputation, people stop coming and they close.
Tourist restaurants &#8211; whose main attraction is their location, and
whose customers frequently don&#8217;t know anything about their reputation &#8211;
can thrive even if they aren&#8217;t any good. And sometimes a restaurant can
keep its reputation &#8211; an award in a magazine, a special occasion
restaurant that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; is the place to go &#8211; long after its
food and service have declined.

Details of the LoveMachine plans are understandably sketchy at the
moment. However, Rosedale and company have got a public worklist of
jobs that they need a contractor to take on, and &#8211; if you live in the
San Francisco area &#8211; they&#8217;re looking to hire. [hat tip to Fabio
