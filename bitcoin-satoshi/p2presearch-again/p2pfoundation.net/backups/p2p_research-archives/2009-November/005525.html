<PRE>It's kind of difficlt to police different styles as this is a mixed list,
ranging from ryan's one line links to paul's link-floods, to stan and andy's
super-thoughtfull mini-essays and many things in between ... one thing is
that is there is no obligation to reply or even to read ...

what about exporting in-depth debates to Ning, and open debates there, for
'limited' periods of time. For example, stan could say, I want to discuss
this particular topic, let's do it this week in a forum on NIng?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On neural evidence, you are right again that it is not for 100% sure

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To pull another bit from something previously linked:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Why Do Some People Become Psychopaths?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/30482">http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/30482</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many researchers now believe that the core defect in psychopathy &#8212; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what most distinguishes it from other antisocial behavior disorders &#8212; is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what are called &quot;callous/unemotional traits.&quot; [Note the use of the word
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;callous&quot; and consider the below slashdot article text using the same word,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> referencing a statement by Peggy Noonan.] A child who kicks another child
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because he's angry and can't control himself but feels terrible afterwards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may be antisocial, but he's not psychopathic. It's the kid who does it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feels no remorse &#8212; or even gets angrier because the other child's crying is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> annoying &#8212; who's most worrisome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  What causes this lack of empathy? Many &#8212; but not all &#8212; psychopaths were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abused or neglected as children. Being treated poorly early on can set up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child to see everyone else as selfish and cruel, causing them to replicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that kind of behavior as a way to cope with a nasty, uncaring world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the vast majority of abused and neglected children grow up to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caring, and some are even especially sensitive &#8212; far from psychopathic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  James Blair, Ph.D., studies troubled children as chief of affective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cognitive neuroscience unit in the mood and anxiety disorders program at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> National Institute of Mental Health. He says that post-traumatic stress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disorder (PTSD), which can be one result of childhood trauma, can be seen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some ways as the opposite of psychopathy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;There's one core structure in the brain that's over-responsive in PTSD &#8212;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's the amygdala,&quot; he says. This region is critical for perceiving and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responding to threats. In PTSD, the amygdala is hypersensitive to threats,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> producing fear in situations that wouldn't seem to be frightening to most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  But in brain scans of people who have high levels of callous or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unemotional traits, &quot;We see a reduced response of the amygdala to threat,&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> says Blair.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  That doesn't mean that the psychopaths weren't exposed to trauma &#8212; a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brain faced with overwhelming stress can respond either by becoming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hypersensitive or insensitive, depending on a multitude of factors,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including genetics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Indeed, callous and unemotional traits do seem to be highly genetic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> About 70 percent of the variance between people on this dimension seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be inherited. However, a study of sons of criminals found that those who had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a highly responsive stress system were far less likely to become criminals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves than those whose stress system was less responsive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, what to do about genetic differences socially is another issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes they can be adaptive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, see:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Slashdot | Bad Driving May Have Genetic Basis&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/10/29/1615214/Bad-Driving-May-Have-Genetic-Basis">http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/10/29/1615214/Bad-Driving-May-Have-Genetic-Basis</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Bad drivers may in part have their genes to blame, suggests a new study
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by UC Irvine neuroscientists. People with a particular gene variant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performed more than 20 percent worse on a driving test than people without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it &#8212; and a follow-up test a few days later yielded similar results. About 30
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> percent of Americans have the variant. 'These people make more errors from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away,' said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dr. Steven Cramer, neurology associate professor and senior author of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, from the cited article on the value of that gene:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu/features/feature_bdnfdriving_091028.php">http://www.uci.edu/features/feature_bdnfdriving_091028.php</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The gene variant isn't always bad, though. Studies have found that people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with it maintain their usual mental sharpness longer than those without it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple sclerosis are present.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It's as if nature is trying to determine the best approach,&quot; Cramer says.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;If you want to learn a new skill or have had a stroke and need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regenerate brain cells, there's evidence that having the variant is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good. But if you've got a disease that affects cognitive function, there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evidence it can act in your favor. The variant brings a different balance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between flexibility and stability.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some other recent slashdot discussion mentioning psychopaths, as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> article and two comments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Nothing To Fear But Fearlessness Itself?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://news.slashdot.org/story/09/11/01/1713258/Nothing-To-Fear-But-Fearlessness-Itself">http://news.slashdot.org/story/09/11/01/1713258/Nothing-To-Fear-But-Fearlessness-Itself</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;In a post last August, Robert X. Cringely voiced fears that Goldman Sachs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and others were not so much evil as 'clueless about the implications of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their work,' leaving it up to the government to fix any mess they leave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind. 'But what if government runs out of options,' worried Cringely. 'Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic policy doesn't imagine it, nor does our foreign policy, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> superpowers don't acknowledge weakness.' And now his fears are echoed in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WSJ opinion piece by Peggy Noonan titled 'We're Governed by Callous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Children.' She writes, 'We are governed at all levels by America's luckiest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> children, sons and daughters of the abundance, and they call themselves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimists but they're not optimists &#8212; they're unimaginative. They don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faith, they've just never been foreclosed on. They are stupid and they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callous [Note the word, and compare with the above on children and how some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few become psychopths], and they don't mind it when people become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disheartened. They don't even notice.' With apologies to FDR, do we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing to fear but fearlessness itself?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One comment on that by someone else, similar to my question at the start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of this p2p thread:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1426748&amp;cid=29943450">http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1426748&amp;cid=29943450</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It took me a long time to figure out why things are going to hell. Then I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read <A HREF="http://www.youmeworks.com/sociopaths.html">http://www.youmeworks.com/sociopaths.html</A> and it all made sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sociopaths seek power and winning without conscience and this is why banking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and wall street leaders are where they are, because they've changed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system of laws to favor themselves. Like terminators, they don't feel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remorse or care if their actions hurt other people. These people are now a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large proportion of our international corporate leadership. Until our system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collapses, they will stay in power, even though they are the reason for our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffering and downfall as a nation. Not sure what there is to do about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation except have people come to recognize sociopaths for what they are,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broken people who should never be allowed to hold power. From the web site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 12 clues to recognizing a sociopath ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One reply to that comment again by someone else:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1426748&amp;cid=29944848">http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1426748&amp;cid=29944848</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The silver lining to this could is that if:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. the sociopath believes that there is a widespread catastrophic issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that will affect himself as well as everyone else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. the sociopath is powerful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. no one else is going to do anything to fix it ...the sociopath will do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, genetic diversity is a good thing. That's why most species are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sexual, to maintain a larger genetic pool of variation and recombination
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than just by cloning. Nature seems to favor a diversity of approaches to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, you are quite right to question how useful a &quot;sociopath&quot; term or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paradigm for understanding current politics is. But in any case, it is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meme that p2p needs to think about, IMHO. Thanks for contributing to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a BA in Psychology from Princeton, for what it is worth. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mentioned here: :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Post-Scarcity Princeton, or, Reading between the lines of PAW for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prospective Princeton students, or, the Health Risks of Heart Disease&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At least my advisor, when I asked him, said it was OK to talk about his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sex life in there. :-) But, he was a past president of the American
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Psychological Association, so I figured it would be OK. :-) Another advisee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that year, I found out only when she came to visit, was the son of Dr. Ruth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Westheimer. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But we all know psychologists are all crazy, right? :-) For example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;How To Tell If Your Therapist Is Crazy (Part One)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ironshrink.com/articles.php?artID=070828_is_my_therapist_crazy">http://www.ironshrink.com/articles.php?artID=070828_is_my_therapist_crazy</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Truth is, I&#8217;ve heard some disheartening stories of incompetence, conceit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and meanness among my colleagues. Add to that various tales of boundary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violations, diagnostic ineptitude, and goofy, new age therapies. It&#8217;s enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make a guy to wonder: is it true? Do psychologists struggle with mental
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> illness more often then the general population? As is my tradition, I hit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the literature in the hopes of scrounging up some facts. ... I&#8217;ve heard it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said that shrinks aren&#8217;t simply screwed up, they&#8217;re shrinks because they&#8217;re
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screwed up. Where did I hear that? Why, from shrinks themselves. ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, as another president of the APA suggests, it may be better to focus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on amplifying the positive, than diminishing the negative:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People who tend to be sociopathic tend to have certain traits. What is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positive about that? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Above there was one suggestion, if a sociopath became concerned about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effect of global issues on himself or herself. Consider, even in China:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/opinion/09friedman.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/opinion/09friedman.html?_r=1</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Watching both the health care and climate/energy debates in Congress, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is hard not to draw the following conclusion: There is only one thing worse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than one-party autocracy, and that is one-party democracy, which is what we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have in America today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  One-party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonably enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great advantages. That one party can just impose the politically difficult
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 21st century. It is not an accident that China is committed to overtaking us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and wind power. China&#8217;s leaders understand that in a world of exploding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> populations and rising emerging-market middle classes, demand for clean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power and energy efficiency is going to soar. Beijing wants to make sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it owns that industry and is ordering the policies to do that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including boosting gasoline prices, from the top down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Our one-party democracy is worse. The fact is, on both the energy/climate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legislation and health care legislation, only the Democrats are really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> playing. With a few notable exceptions, the Republican Party is standing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arms folded and saying &#8220;no.&#8221; Many of them just want President Obama to fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Such a waste. Mr. Obama is not a socialist; he&#8217;s a centrist. But if he&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forced to depend entirely on his own party to pass legislation, he will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whipsawed by its different factions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not saying China is a sociopath or run by sociopaths. I'm just giving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an example of how &quot;enlightened self interest&quot; coupled with a strong will can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accomplish some good stuff. I'd rather we did not have a government run by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one or more sociopaths. But, if we did, I'm just trying to look on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bright side. :-) Can we help enlighten sociopaths to see their own long term
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self interests and act better on them? I don't know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if the government was enlightened, consider this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Corporation as Psychopath&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0218-01.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0218-01.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The filmmakers juxtapose well-shot interviews of defenders and critics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the reality on the ground -- Charles Kernaghan in Central America
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> showing how, for example, big apparel manufacturers pay workers pennies for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> products that sell for hundreds of dollars in the United States -- with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defenders of the regime -- Milton Friedman looking frumpy as he says with as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straight a face as he can -- the only moral imperative for a corporate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executive is to make as much money for the corporate owners as he or she
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Others agree with Friedman. Management guru Peter Drucker tells Bakan:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;If you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibilities, fire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> him. Fast.&quot; And William Niskanen, chair of the libertarian Cato Institute,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> says that he would not invest in a company that pioneered in corporate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsibility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Of course, state corporation laws actually impose a legal duty on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporate executives to make money for shareholders. Engage in social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsibility -- pay more money to workers, stop legal pollution, lower the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price to customers -- and you'll likely be sued by your shareholders. Robert
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Monks, the investment manager, puts it this way: &quot;The corporation is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> externalizing machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (shark seeking young woman swimming on the screen). There isn't any question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of malevolence or of will. The enterprise has within it, and the shark has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within it, those characteristics that enable it to do that for which it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally think machine evolution is unstoppable, and the best hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for humanity is the noble cowardice of creating refugia and trying, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the duckweed, to create human (and other) life faster than other forces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can destroy it. [Though I now see social networking like p2p as another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promising alternative, to interlink with that, where the social network is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much stronger is some ways that the individual and can help reign in some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> negatives, as it maintains a Manuel de Landa Meshworks and Hierarchies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balance.]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Note, I'm not saying machine evolution won't have a human component --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in that sense, a corporation or any bureaucracy is already a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine intelligence, just not a very smart or resilient one. This sense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the corporation comes out of Langdon Winner's book &quot;Autonomous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Technology: Technics out of control as a theme in political thought&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/~winner/">http://www.rpi.edu/~winner/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may have a tough time believing this, but Winner makes a convincing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case. He suggests that all successful organizations &quot;reverse-adapt&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their goals and their environment to ensure their continued survival.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  These corporate machine intelligences are already driving for better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine intelligences -- faster, more efficient, cheaper, and more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resilient. People forget that corporate charters used to be routinely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revoked for behavior outside the immediate public good, and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporations were not considered persons until around 1886 (that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision perhaps being the first major example of a machine using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political/social process of its own ends).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corporate charters are granted supposedly because society believe it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the best interest of *society* for corporations to exist. ...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, lots of links have rotted in there. :-(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the point is, we have created a social organization form (the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporation, one that is immortal and many are very powerful, and which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> driven by only fiat dollar numerical &quot;profit&quot; many times) that may exhibit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychopthic behavior. And, through them, we are not creating physical forms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the artificial intelligence, sometimes but not always embodied in a robot,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that may also exhibit psychopathic behavior. Corporations and robots have,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so far, no friends or family as entities -- in the sense that they are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet designed to think that way. (Some work on swarm robotics is being done.)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Paul, I respect your point of view but I do not share it. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Desires, intelligence, values, - rings true, up to a point. But it's sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of like id, ego, superego. A way of naming and thus discussing something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about mind or personality that seems real to many of us, but not terribly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> informative about how we function or could or should function.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I suggest that if we are affirming values (widely shared or otherwise) we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ought to affirm Respect for Human Autonomy. The idea that one individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better determine that individual's needs, wants, and means than another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea that one may be mistaken, especially about other people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I believe the evolutionary environment humans have adapted to, is that of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other humans. Hence the skill at detecting cheaters, free riders etc. - as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well as the adulation for those whose exploits demonstrate both a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specialness as an individual and a major contribution to the community as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole - success in two major areas of human endeavor. I think our great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teachers refer to this when they talk about harmony, about finding peace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a part of the whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Another related value: voluntary decisions aren't only more whole-hearted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than compelled ones, they are more likely to be correct for the precise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual circumstances. Summed over all humanity, these individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions - sometimes competitive, sometimes cooperative, are the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well-spring of progress, both material and moral.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't completely agree with that, because it leaves out the issue of how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people negotiate to do collective actions, or how they decide some actions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are out of bounds, but there is a lot of wisdom there. There were various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replies to the point I made. That thread on values and technology is here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;[unrev-II] Is &quot;bootstrapping&quot; part of the problem?&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That was a great mailing list to be on related to Doug Engelbart's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts, and I am thankful for a chance to participate on it and learn so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much with many very wonderful people. That and the early Squeak list are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps my models of healthy p2p communities related to digital tools and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surrounding issues. They gave me some hope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, these are growing issues in our society, framed as a negative,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related to decreasing psychothic behavior:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get people to have less psychopathic behavior? Abundance of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> love and good food and sunlight would usually help (even, in the few times,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when that love comes through as authority, as per the above article mentions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on what works best for developing a conscience in some, not all, kids.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get organizations to have less psychopathic behavior? Coming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with better ways to structure their charters and their social/economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surroundings might help, as might be changing the meshworks/hierarchies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balance with p2p activities. Even the most benign seeming institutions can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have hidden pathologies: (only picking on the UUs as I respect them a lot)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.left-bank.org/antiuu/">http://www.left-bank.org/antiuu/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get the machines and software we build to have less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychopathic behavior? James P. Hogan talks about this in &quot;The Two Faces of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tommorrow&quot;. Isaac Asimov talked about it with his &quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, we need to build our ethics into our artifacts. We already do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that every day (as Langdon Winner and others talk about) but unfortunately,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often in an unconscious or sociopathic way, that often reflects a scarcity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideology (like emphasizing minimum production costs or maximizing fiat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dollar revenues or passing external costs to others or ignoring systemic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risks). We need Bucky Fuller's (and other's) ideas of a &quot;Comprehensive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anticipatory Design Science&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://challenge.bfi.org/movie">http://challenge.bfi.org/movie</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Like cancer, sociopathic behavior is probably inherent in any system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because part of it depends on perspective. Cancer is basically one cell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saying, &quot;I'm just for me, in a different way, and I'm in it for the short
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> term.&quot; Sociopathic behavior is similar. But, ultimately, there is the issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of sense of self. How big is a &quot;self&quot;? A gene? A genome? A finger? A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought? A brain? A body? A career? A family? A neighborhood? A network? A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world? A universe? Etc. There are many ways to define self.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we reframe those things above in positive psychology terms, in terms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasing positive behiviours, they might be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get people to have more compassionate and joyful behavior?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get organizations to have more life-affirming behavior that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meets societies unmet needs?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (A businessperson I admire; sadly he died recently. But his legacy lives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How do we get the machines and software we build to have more helpful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and compassionate and life-affirming and joyful and so on behaviors? Do we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focus on &quot;friendly AI&quot;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With either affirming core human values, as above?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, you'd be right to question an overly simplistic us/them notion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;sociopath&quot;, even beyond formal &quot;diagnosis&quot;. But, that still leaves open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these deeper questions. Same as researching cancer is ultimately a complex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enterprise, involving everything about what it means for a population to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> live and evolve, so too may be the idea of &quot;sociopath&quot; something that calls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to us to think big to understand it, and deal with the situation our current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reality calls for in a healthy joyful way. Of course, a sociopath might ask,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> healthy and joyful for whom? Or anyone else might ask that too. :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a graduate professor (Frank von Hippel) taught in a Woodrow Wilson
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> School course I took (a class my grad department in Civil Engineering and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of what cost me my PhD there), paraphrasing: &quot;Cost benefit analysis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involves asking, who pays the costs, and who gets the benefits, accepting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the two groups may not be the same.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which pretty much sums up big some major big problems in current and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> historical global politics.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this riveting book about the world of professional work, Jeff Schmidt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> demonstrates that the workplace is a battleground for the very identity of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the individual, as is graduate school, where professionals are trained. He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shows that professional work is inherently political, and that professionals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are hired to subordinate their own vision and maintain strict &#8220;ideological
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discipline.&#8221; The hidden root of much career dissatisfaction, argues Schmidt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the professional&#8217;s lack of control over the political component of his or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> her creative work. Many professionals set out to make a contribution to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> society and add meaning to their lives. Yet our system of professional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> education and employment abusively inculcates an acceptance of politically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subordinate roles in which professionals typically do not make a significant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference, undermining the creative potential of individuals, organizations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and even democracy. Schmidt details the battle one must fight to be an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent thinker and to pursue one&#8217;s own social vision in today&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporate society. He shows how an honest reassessment of what it really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means to be a professional employee can be remarkably liberating. After
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reading this brutally frank book, no one who works for a living will ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think the same way about his or her job.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is our very academia, that which should provide our moral compass, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help guide us to a better world, itself somewhat a psychopathic institution,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and one that even turns non-psychopaths into psychopaths? :-(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Schmidt writes essentially about how one of the reasons many academics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become so dysfunction is that they are trying, somehow, to make up, through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fame or profit or control of others lives, for the trauma most of them were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put through in graduate school and the early years of their professional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work, where their hopes to make a difference were squashed, and now they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still trying to get something out of all that. :-(

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But with that said, some graduate advisers are great, many grad students
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are better than I was at advanced calculus, some good percent of academics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make very positive contributions either because they had a great graduate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience or despite it, or even because of it. To echo again the words
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above about kids:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What causes this lack of empathy? Many &#8212; but not all &#8212; psychopaths were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abused or neglected as children. Being treated poorly early on can set up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child to see everyone else as selfish and cruel, causing them to replicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that kind of behavior as a way to cope with a nasty, uncaring world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the vast majority of abused and neglected children grow up to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caring, and some are even especially sensitive &#8212; far from psychopathic.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, before I celebrate how wonderful grad school is, again, on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychologists, part two of the essay cited above:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;How To Tell If Your Therapist Is Crazy (Part Two)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ironshrink.com/articles.php?artID=070910_how_to_choose_a_therapist">http://www.ironshrink.com/articles.php?artID=070910_how_to_choose_a_therapist</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As tempting as it is to believe that most mental health workers are wacky
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and maladjusted, the data tell a different story. For the most part, we seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be fairly sane. Our downfall, in my sometimes overbearing opinion, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we have a tendency toward muddled thinking. Our logic chips are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequently on the fritz, and it is our patients who pay the price in time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money, and heartache.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Consider this example. The case is fictional, but it is based on far too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many real situations that I've had the misfortune to witness.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Sally goes to a psychologist complaining of depression. Ever since her
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divorce and layoff last year, she just can't get out of her blue funk. Prior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to those events, life was grand for Sally. She was happy and surrounded by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friends. She believes that the events of last year sent her into depression,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and she simply wants to get her life moving again. The psychologist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagrees with Sally's assessment. After several sessions, he concludes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sally's problem stems from childhood abuse and that she may be suffering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from Multiple Personality Disorder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Sally thinks she is depressed; the psychologist thinks she is Sybil.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Seems illogical to reach that conclusion, doesn't it? Not if you went to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graduate school. Reaching that type of conclusion a simple matter of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignoring the facts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If the psychologist doesn't believe Sally, if he buys into preconceived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notions, or if he believes he knows more about Sally than Sally does, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he is free to reach any conclusion he wishes. It is rarely so egregious, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it happens in smaller ways more often than you might imagine. Brain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blockages like this one are important to screen for in choosing a therapist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What are we to say about a social system like academic and professional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychology that turns people who want to care into dysfunctional or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disempowered helpers? Would &quot;psychopathic&quot; be the right word?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or, if we should never blame on malice what could be attributed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stupidity, should we merely use the term, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    The present condition of humanity was best described by the philosopher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gottfried Leibnitz a few hundred years ago when he said that humans would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so occupied with making scientific discoveries in every sector for several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centuries that they would not look at the totality. But, he said, someday
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proliferation and complexity of our knowledge would become so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bewildering that it would be necessary to develop a global, universal, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synthetic view. This is exactly the time and juncture at which we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arrived. It shows in our new preoccupations with what is called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'interdisciplinary', 'global thinking', 'interdependence', and so on. It is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the same phenomenon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    One of the most useful things humanity could do at this point is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make an honest inventory of what we know. I have suggested to foundations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they ought to bring together the chief editors of the world's main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encyclopedias to agree on a common table of contents of human knowledge. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can be a dangerous idea. Why? Well, when the Frenchman Diderot invented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first encyclopedia, the archbishop of Paris ran to the king of France to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have the book burned because it would totally change the existing value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system of the Catholic church. If we developed a common index of human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge today it would similarly cause a change in our value systems. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would discover that in the whole framework of knowledge the contest between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Israel and the Muslims would barely be listed because it is such a small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem in the totality of our preoccupation as a human species. The meeting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might have to last several days before the editors would even mention it!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is exactly the point: some people don't want to develop such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework of knowledge because they want their problem to be the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important problem on earth and go to great lengths to promote that notion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    So that is what I believe to be most necessary for global security: an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ordering of our knowledge at this point in our evolution, a good, honest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classification of all we know from the infinitely large to the infinitely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small - the cosmos, our planet, humanity, our dreams, our wishes, and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We haven't done it yet, but we will have to do it one way or another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To amplify one point there: &quot;some people don't want to develop such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework of knowledge&quot;. Is that related to &quot;psychopathic behavior&quot;? Or is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it just &quot;selfish&quot; with a very small definition for size of self?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But we can still sing anyway:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Christmas presents and decorations from the Whos, Christmas comes just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I never really got that as a kid. :-) But see also:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;When the cornucopia was brought to the Pilgrims, the Iroquois People
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sought to assist these Boat People in destroying their fear of scarcity. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Native understanding is that there is always enough for everyone when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abundance is shared and when gratitude is given back to the Original Source.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The trick was to explain the concept of the Field of Plenty with few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mutually understood words or signs. The misunderstanding that sprang from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this lack of common language robbed those who came to Turtle Island of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beautiful teaching.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm very glad to see that we are building such abundant knowledge systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stigmergically, whether Wikipedia, Debian GNU/Linux, or many other projects,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the internet. Let's hope we can keep it happening using peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production and other means. Individual contributors may fall by the wayside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for whatever reasons (politicians, hurry up with that &quot;basic income&quot; for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone already :-), but the community will hopefully continue to thrive to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the point where we see an extensive transformation, as these newly emerged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values and capabilities reflect back on our infrastructure in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life-affirming and compassionate wa. Maybe even, someday, with robots and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people playing/working together, like at the end of Wall-E :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Due to controversy and overlaps between clinial tools, such as the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's hard to cut through the &quot;popular science&quot; fluff and find the meat in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most work on these subjects.  For example, measures of &quot;psychopathy&quot; are

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anti-social personality disorder (ASPD).   While psychopathy and ASPD are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correlated, only a fraction of prisoners diagnosed with ASPD meet the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PCL-R
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> criteria for psychopathy.  In fact, ASPD is almost synonymous with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;someone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the US prison system&quot; (around 80% of US prisoners are ASPD) and given
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> disproportionately large prisoner population in the US, there's a really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fishy smell to the whole business.  It's important to keep this in mind
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reviewing research articles written for the public that touch on either.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While I'm not discounting the PCL-R, I have grave doubts about it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representing a distinct taxonomic group.  It's factor 1 and factor 2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> measure
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very different things.  I've run across studies where one of the factors
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will correlate strongly with some behavior, but the other will not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My warning, as someone that actually studied psychology--and still
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does--is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> take it all with a salt-shaker of salt.  This tends to be good advice
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> across
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the behavioral sciences in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Paul, at some point you said &quot;Some may be genetic too,&quot; but the study you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pointed to only tested for neural activation.  Neural activation does NOT
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mean genetic evidence.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Aggressive adolescents showed a specific and very strong activation of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> amygdala and ventral striatum (an area that responds to feeling

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when watching pain inflicted on others, which suggested that they

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 12-year-olds are naturally empathetic toward people in pain.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not saying all violent people are psychopaths, most probably are

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bullying.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like with any paradigm, likely we will figure out how to move beyond the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;psychopath&quot; paradigm at some point and see some bigger picture,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dysfunctional relationship, or alternatively, have the resources to help
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fix
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the relationship).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Might there be societies where people with the same inclinations just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not be &quot;psychopaths&quot; in terms of behavior effects because of other
