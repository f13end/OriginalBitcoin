</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ray Kurzweil is one of the exponents of the idea that humans are machines,
</I>&gt;<i> and thus machines will be able to do whatever humans do. His best-selling
</I>&gt;<i> book [1999] is full of prophecies, based upon the following statement:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The human brain has about 100 billion neurons. With an estimated average of
</I>&gt;<i> one thousand connections between each neuron and its neighbors, we have
</I>&gt;<i> about 100 trillion connections, each capable of a simultaneous calculation.
</I>&gt;<i> That's rather massive parallel processing, and one key to the strength of
</I>&gt;<i> human thinking. A profound weakness, however, is the excruciatingly slow
</I>&gt;<i> speed of neural circuitry, only 200 calculations per second.&quot; [p. 103]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This statement is absolutely unjustified. He does not say what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> calculations are done by each neuron connection, and as we have pointed out
</I>&gt;<i> before, he cannot even say how data are stored in the brain. Based upon the
</I>&gt;<i> number above, he multiplies it by the 100x1012 connections existing in the
</I>&gt;<i> brain, coming to the conclusion that we are able to perform 20x1015
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;calculations&quot; per second. He does not even consider the possibility that
</I>&gt;<i> there may be different functions for different connections; for him this
</I>&gt;<i> capacity to perform calculation is the most important factor. He uses the
</I>&gt;<i> same type of reasoning to come to the conclusion that our memory has 1015
</I>&gt;<i> bits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In his classical book, John von Neumann writes: &quot;the standard receptor would
</I>&gt;<i> seem to accept 14 distinct digital impressions per second&quot;. He supposes that
</I>&gt;<i> there are &quot;1010 nerve cells&quot; each one of them working as &quot;an (inner or
</I>&gt;<i> outer) receptor&quot;. Then, &quot;assuming further that there is no true forgetting
</I>&gt;<i> in the nervous system&quot;, and a normal lifetime of 60 years or about 2x109
</I>&gt;<i> seconds, he comes to the conclusion that our memory capacity is 2.8x1020
</I>&gt;<i> bits [1958, p. 63].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is astonishing that such brilliant people can do these sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> calculations, without knowing how our memory works, taking into account that
</I>&gt;<i> our nervous system is not a digital machine, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Making machines become conscious is considered one of the hardest problems
</I>&gt;<i> of Artificial Intelligence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is necessary to distinguish two different kinds: consciousness and
</I>&gt;<i> self-consciousness. Animals can be conscious: if an animal is hit, it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes conscious, aware of its pain and reacts accordingly. But only humans
</I>&gt;<i> can be self-conscious. A careful observation will lead to this difference.
</I>&gt;<i> Self-consciousness requires thinking. We can only be conscious when we are
</I>&gt;<i> fully awake, and think of what we perceive, think, feel or wish. Animals
</I>&gt;<i> aren&#8217;t able to think. If they could they would be creative as humans are. As
</I>&gt;<i> I have already mentioned, no bee tries a different shape than the hexagon
</I>&gt;<i> for its honeycomb. Animals just follow their instincts and conditioning, and
</I>&gt;<i> act accordingly. Due to their thinking ability, humans may reflect on the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of their future actions, and control their actions. As I have
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned (see 3.2) a drunkard may be conscious, but he certainly is not
</I>&gt;<i> fully self-conscious - he cannot control his thinking and actions even if he
</I>&gt;<i> wishes to do so. Then, he acts impulsively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, animal or human consciousness depends on feelings and human
</I>&gt;<i> self-consciousness depends on conscious thinking. As I have already
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned, machines cannot have feelings, and can only simulate a very
</I>&gt;<i> restricted type of thinking: logical-symbolic thinking. One should never say
</I>&gt;<i> that a computer thinks. Thus, I conclude that machines will never be
</I>&gt;<i> conscious, much less self-conscious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is interesting to note that in general one reads about machine and
</I>&gt;<i> consciousness, and very seldom about self-consciousness. Maybe this comes
</I>&gt;<i> from the fact that most scientists regard humans as simple animals - or,
</I>&gt;<i> still worse, as machines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I have expounded on chapter 3, it is linguistically incorrect to say that
</I>&gt;<i> humans are machines, because the concept of a machine does not apply to
</I>&gt;<i> something that has not been designed and built by humans or by machines. But
</I>&gt;<i> let's use this incorrect popular denomination, instead of the more proper
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;physical system&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is much more evidence that humans are not machines. I've already
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned some of them, such as the fact that humans may self determine
</I>&gt;<i> their next thought. Fetzer argues against the mind being a machine using the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that we have other types of thinking than logical-symbolic, such as
</I>&gt;<i> dreams and daydreams, exercise of imagination and conjecture [2001, p. 105],
</I>&gt;<i> and shows that logical symbols are a small part of the signs we use, in
</I>&gt;<i> Peircean terms [p. 60]. He also agrees with Searle that minds have
</I>&gt;<i> semantics, and computers do not [p. 114]. To me, the fact that we feel and
</I>&gt;<i> have willing is also evidence that we are not machines. Another strong
</I>&gt;<i> indication is the fact that we have consciousness and self-consciousness, as
</I>&gt;<i> explained in the last chapter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, the evidences that we are not digital machines are
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelming, as we have seen in section 3.8. I'll give here some more,
</I>&gt;<i> regarding our memory. If it were digital, why do we remember what we see in
</I>&gt;<i> a way that is not as clear as our original perception? If our memory were
</I>&gt;<i> digital, there would be no reason for forgetting - or losing - the details.
</I>&gt;<i> There is also an evolutionary argument in this direction. Certainly the
</I>&gt;<i> people who think that humans are machines also believe in Darwinian
</I>&gt;<i> evolution. But if we were machines, there would be no evolutionary reason
</I>&gt;<i> for not storing - at least for some time - all the details perceived by our
</I>&gt;<i> senses, similarly to the capacity computers have of storing images, sounds,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. It seems to me that storing and retrieving details would certainly
</I>&gt;<i> enhance the chances of surviving and dominating. It follows, then, that from
</I>&gt;<i> a Darwinian perspective our imperfect memory makes no sense. This means that
</I>&gt;<i> either the concept of Darwinian evolution is wrong, or we are not machines -
</I>&gt;<i> or both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, how is it possible to &quot;store&quot; something, forget it and
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly, without &quot;consulting&quot; our memory, remember it? This is not a
</I>&gt;<i> question of access time. A machine either has access to some data or hasn't,
</I>&gt;<i> and this status can only be changed by a foreseen, programmed action.
</I>&gt;<i> Accesses may be interrupted either due to random effects or on purpose,
</I>&gt;<i> directed by the program. This is not our case. Often we make an effort to
</I>&gt;<i> remember and we can't - but we certainly memorize, in our unconscious, every
</I>&gt;<i> experience we have. Some people could say that our unconscious has an
</I>&gt;<i> independent &quot;functioning&quot;, and does the &quot;search&quot; for us. But here we come
</I>&gt;<i> again to the question of consciousness and unconsciousness. Certainly all
</I>&gt;<i> machines are unconscious, as we have explained in the last section. The
</I>&gt;<i> reaction of a thermostat is not due to consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, apparently our memory is infinite; there is no concrete machine
</I>&gt;<i> with infinite memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The capacity of learning is to me also an indication that we are not
</I>&gt;<i> machines. As I said before, computers don't learn, they store data, either
</I>&gt;<i> through some input or results of data processing. If we knew how we learn,
</I>&gt;<i> medical studies in Brazil would not take 6 years. The fact that you are
</I>&gt;<i> reading this paper shows that you have learned how to read. But notice that
</I>&gt;<i> during reading you don't follow the whole process you had to go through, in
</I>&gt;<i> order to learn it. Somehow, just a technique, an end-result of the learning
</I>&gt;<i> process remains. And this is not a question of having stored some calculated
</I>&gt;<i> parameters, as in the case of a (wrongly called) neural net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We share with all living beings an extraordinary capacity for growing and
</I>&gt;<i> regenerating tissues and organs. As I explained in section 3.5, a clear
</I>&gt;<i> observation shows that both processes follow models. Models are not
</I>&gt;<i> physical, they are ideas. The non-physical model is permanently acting upon
</I>&gt;<i> living beings, so they cannot be purely physical systems.
