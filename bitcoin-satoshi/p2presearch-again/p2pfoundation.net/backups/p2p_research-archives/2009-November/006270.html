Hi Paul,

it was a recent study by a union in California, on the county level, I saw
it about 6 weeks ago, trouble is, I spent half an hour in my tags and on
google, and can't get a hold of it again ... I think it had &quot;Sonoma county&quot;
in the heading ...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The LL fallacy has been tirelessly combated by Tom Walker:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.lump-of-labor.org/">http://www.lump-of-labor.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.worklessparty.org/wlitblog/">http://www.worklessparty.org/wlitblog/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the links. I especially liked this at the first one:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I should point out that the preceding cannot be done and I will elaborate
</I>&gt;<i> on just one reason why it cannot. If the existing hours of work are
</I>&gt;<i> excessive from the standpoint of physiological or psychological fatigue,
</I>&gt;<i> reducing the hours of work is a &quot;technological improvement&quot; that can,
</I>&gt;<i> ceteris paribus, result in an increase in total output. &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; You may
</I>&gt;<i> say. &quot;If total output is increased by shorter hours that means that the same
</I>&gt;<i> output could be produced with fewer workers and therefore shorter hours
</I>&gt;<i> would destroy rather than create jobs!&quot; But if you do say that you have
</I>&gt;<i> fallen into a trap, because of the conviction that &quot;technology creates more
</I>&gt;<i> jobs than it destroys,&quot; which is, of course, the basis (or, at least, one of
</I>&gt;<i> the bases) of the observation that there is NOT a fixed amount of work.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also: &quot;This brings me back to my argument, that leisure is a factor of
</I>&gt;<i> production and that it is simply wrong to treat leisure as a &quot;normal good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> such that the sum of income and leisure is a constant. In fact, when the
</I>&gt;<i> current hours of work are &quot;too long&quot; (an empirical matter that can only be
</I>&gt;<i> determined by experience) increasing the amount of leisure will increase the
</I>&gt;<i> value of the total. In the extreme case, it could even increase the income
</I>&gt;<i> too. Or, to put it more simply, you can have your cake and eat it, too. This
</I>&gt;<i> is not to say you can always have it -- it is still an empirical question
</I>&gt;<i> whether the given hours of work are &quot;too long&quot; but that at least is the
</I>&gt;<i> implication of Chapman's theory.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, I find his writing a bit unclear in the rest. He seems to be arguing
</I>&gt;<i> both that no one said exactly what is trotted out to then claim is a
</I>&gt;<i> fallacy, and then some other points about labor and economics?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really am arguing that there *is* essentially a fixed amount of work to
</I>&gt;<i> be done by humans in a healthy society that also has exponentially
</I>&gt;<i> increasing automation. It may be much larger amount of work than what we do
</I>&gt;<i> now (given so many people go hungry or are without some types of technology
</I>&gt;<i> if we expanded our foreign aid, and also because we might want a *real*
</I>&gt;<i> space program again someday employing millions of people), but demaind is
</I>&gt;<i> still in some sense definable as having limits relative to our technological
</I>&gt;<i> capacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which seems a different argument than Tom Walker is making?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it seems pretty clear that over the last few hundred years (and
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring our distant hunter/gatherer past and even some parts of the Middle
</I>&gt;<i> Ages), that industrial labor has reduced from eighty hours days for everyone
</I>&gt;<i> (even *children* in mills) to now a forty hour day only for some adults.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems like a big change. Excessive schooling has mopped up a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> that surplus of labor (keeping children endlessly on a treadmill, now into
</I>&gt;<i> their twenties via graduate school, and making jobs for teachers) and
</I>&gt;<i> television has mopped up much of the rest. Clay Shirky writes about that
</I>&gt;<i> here:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Gin, Television, and Social Surplus&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it still seems to me like this issues is central to arguments about
</I>&gt;<i> the future of our industrial society. If the only way to keep people
</I>&gt;<i> employed is endless makework, then that seems a big problem with economics.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, in the USA, a big argument why we can't have single payer
</I>&gt;<i> health reform is people saying about five million workers would lose their
</I>&gt;<i> jobs if that one third of every health care dollar was no longer spent on
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucracy. There seems to be something seriously wrong there with economic
</I>&gt;<i> discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   But this is what someone like Paul Krugman says on it:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Lumps of Labor&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/100703.html">http://www.pkarchive.org/column/100703.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Economists call it the &quot;lump of labor fallacy.&quot; It's the idea that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is a fixed amount of work to be done in the world, so any increase in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> amount each worker can produce reduces the number of available jobs. (A
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> famous example: those dire warnings in the 1950's that automation would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lead
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to mass unemployment.) As the derisive name suggests, it's an idea
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> economists view with contempt, yet the fallacy makes a comeback whenever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> economy is sluggish.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But wait--Krugman himself is a little wobbly on the issue:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/opinion/22krugman.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/opinion/22krugman.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;To be more specific: the severe housing slump we&#8217;re experiencing now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will end eventually, but the immense Bush-era housing boom won&#8217;t be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repeated. Consumers will eventually regain some of their confidence,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but they won&#8217;t spend the way they did in 2005-2007, when many people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were using their houses as ATMs, and the savings rate dropped nearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to zero.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;So what will support the economy if cautious consumers and humbled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> homebuilders aren&#8217;t up to the job?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A basic income? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the administration is hoping for people taking on more debt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michel mentioned US$40 an hour as the inflation and productivity and equity
</I>&gt;<i> adjusted figure for a minimum wage -- I'd love a reference? I'm starting to
</I>&gt;<i> think raising the minimum wage back to US$40 an hour may be what it takes?
</I>&gt;<i> :-) But I'd rather see a basic income and no minimum wage. It may be too
</I>&gt;<i> late for a raise in minimum wage to fix things at all, given how fast
</I>&gt;<i> companies can automate and redesign.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the biggest groups that argue against a higher minimum wage is the
</I>&gt;<i> fast food industry. For example, why could we not have restaurants that are
</I>&gt;<i> more automated? People used to eat in &quot;automats&quot; in the 1950s. One could
</I>&gt;<i> imagine seeing that again, but maybe with more robots.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automat</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it likely someone could build an almost fully automated restaurant
</I>&gt;<i> if they tried. It might take some redesign as well as some careful product
</I>&gt;<i> selections as to what is on the menu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's one reason a higher minimum wage may not work -- we'd see an
</I>&gt;<i> even faster push to automate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What surprises me is it seems like economists have their head in the sand
</I>&gt;<i> about the automation of *services*. They are willing to accept farming could
</I>&gt;<i> be automated. Now they are slowly accepting that manufacturing is being
</I>&gt;<i> automated (and 3D printing is a big thing coming along in that direction).
</I>&gt;<i> But they still seem to not be able to accept services can be automated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing on mainstream economists -- by the values and logic most of them
</I>&gt;<i> espouse, the single biggest thing mainstream economists will be concerned
</I>&gt;<i> about in regards to talking about employment is the issue of how to keep
</I>&gt;<i> their own cushy jobs. :-) If you think about things that way, then it makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense that mainstream economists would say whatever it takes to hold on to
</I>&gt;<i> well paying jobs, and to push whatever theories the status quo needed to
</I>&gt;<i> stay the status quo. In short, there may be a huge conflict of interest in
</I>&gt;<i> the field of economics based on the fact that most economists are paid by
</I>&gt;<i> the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who is not so dedicated to having a cushy job as a mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> economist might have different values. Including not assuming unlimited
</I>&gt;<i> greed is the primary emotion that drives most people most of the time. Or,
</I>&gt;<i> even if they believed that, they might not assume it was a good thing, and
</I>&gt;<i> might suggest ways to reign in excessive greed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Related, though from a different angle, here is a blog post by someone
</I>&gt;<i> showing the damage the mythology of competitive mainstream economics can do
</I>&gt;<i> to idealism:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Does econ make people conservative? &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/does-econ-make-people-conservative.html">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/does-econ-make-people-conservative.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;As a Princeton grad myself, I have full confidence in your teacher.
</I>&gt;<i> Putting that issue aside, let me address your central question: Does the
</I>&gt;<i> study of economics tend to make people conservative? I believe the answer
</I>&gt;<i> is, to some degree, yes. My experience is that many students find that their
</I>&gt;<i> views become somewhat more conservative after studying economics. There are
</I>&gt;<i> at least three, related reasons. ... Second, some of the striking insights
</I>&gt;<i> of economics make one more respectful of the market as a mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> coordinating a society. Because market participants are motivated by
</I>&gt;<i> self-interest, a person might naturally be suspect of market-based
</I>&gt;<i> societies. But after learning about the gains from trade, the invisible
</I>&gt;<i> hand, and the efficiency of market equilibrium, one starts to approach the
</I>&gt;<i> market with a degree of admiration and, indeed, awe. ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, even if markets work, then one has to ask how they should be
</I>&gt;<i> regulated, taxed, and subsidized to meet broad social goals, given
</I>&gt;<i> externalities, a concentration of wealth, feedback cycles, etc. ...
