<PRE>Thank you Rufo for this invitation.

I do not have myself the technical skills for this type of seminar, but I'll
forward it to our network, in particular to Valentin Spirik, who is very
expert in this area and is perhaps willing to organize a workshop under our
name.

In any case, we can certainly help in diffusing the info, so don't hesitate
to send me any or all material on  the event, at any time of your
convenience.

Michel

</I>The ProCaster* Revolution - Draft Proposal
Sustainable self-publishing and self-promotion for independent video
producers in the era of the
Internet TV.
*Producer+Broadcaster
Rome, Proposed date: Oct 1-8, 2010
Executive Summary
The ProCaster Revolution is a two-day conference on how to create and
mantain sustainable selfpublishing
and self-promotion activities for independent video producers in the era of
the Internet
TV and on the convergence of online video and broadcast media for
independent publishers, for
which the term ProCaster was coined (Producer+Broadcaster). Remember
ProSumer
(Producer+Consumer)? Well, being a ProCaster might be the next step in the
chain.
For the first time in history, the power of the moving image is available to
all citizens. Free and
low-cost tools for creating video and sharing it with the world are now
within reach, slowly
diminishing the supremacy of traditional broadcast television. But to
navigate this frontier requires
new modes of creation and distribution. How will the next generation of
content reach its audience?
Artists, engineers, and businesspeople will get together for a two-day
exploration of what's next in
video production and distribution. Attendees will be introduced to the
cutting edge in technology,
innovative business models for finance and production, and how to make films
that are meant to be
shared.
The ProCaster Revolution will also be an opportunity to meet like-minded
individuals who are
experimenting in exciting ways, to share skills and insights. This event
will focus on independent
publishing; open technologies for production, post-production and
distribution of video, business
models and communication strategies for video self-publisihng and
self-promotion.
In addition to the two-day conference program (featuring panels,
presentations, film screenings, and
an expo floor) the event will be followed by a week of action. Free and Paid
expert workshops will
be offered for students and corporate employees on emerging video
technologies, business models,
communication strategies and sustainable self-publishing. These workshops
will introduce open
technologies and the opportunities they present for businesses and
individuals.
The ProCaster Revolution organization will be curated by a local coordinator
(under the title
&quot;Managing Director&quot;) with experience in similar events and two assistants
(one local, one
international) that will have as their main duty to ensure the participation
of significant figures in
industry - legislators, entrepreneurs, artists, content producers, etc.
The ProCaster Revolution is promoted by Telematics Freedom Foundation and
Open Video
Alliance.

Communication Plan
Description of promotion and/or communication strategies:
Target
The target public for the event are small/micro web-centered or
web-exclusive video producers,
students and young creatives. But the event will also be interesting for
employees of companies in
the audiovisual and new media sectors, independent professionals and
industry consultants, artists,
directors and screenwriters interested in knowing how new technologies and
new media can
stimulate the market and creativity of their production and facilitate the
processes of distributing
content digitally and independently.
The workshops are targeted to independent film-makers and documentarians,
ICT staff of major
content producers, broadcasters, distributors, IPTV providers, professionals
in telecommunications
and students interested in deepening their knowledge about Open Source tools
of production and
post-production, new models of distribution and licensing of digital
content, and in acquiring a
network of professional contacts helpful in their future career.
Italy ranks among the first countries in the world for the number of fans of
social networking and
communities, surpassing the U.S., Britain, France and Germany. The time
spent on the web has
doubled in the last year (+118%) (Nielsen, March 2009). 40% of the Italian
population uses the
Internet regularly, among those 15% over 55 years old connect to the Web
every day. Using
opportunities for interaction with people through the Internet is a
strategic element because it allows
to:
&#61623; be present in an active and proactive way on the Internet, using existing
channels to promote
the brand and services offered,
&#61623; monitor populated parts of the Internet to follow conversations, dialogue
with influencers
and identify new 'brand ambassador' bearers of positive word of mouth,
&#61623; build a relationship with the community.
For these reasons, the event will also reaching a general audience that
frequently surf the web
looking for news and new developments in the audiovisual and digital content
worlds.
Goals
These Conference Sessions and the workshops offered work together to achieve
a number of
objectives, including:
&#61623; To set the event as a unique opportunity for socialization and training in
audiovisual
technologies, free and paid;
&#61623; To introduce concepts on new media and new technologies;
&#61623; To introduce concepts and open technologies in the audiovisual sector and
the opportunities
it presents for companies and individuals;
&#61623; To develop a critical knowledge in the new generations on the evolution of
audiovisual
language;
&#61623; To exploring the future of video production and distribution through Free
and Open Source
technologies, innovative business models to finance and produce video; the
use of internet
and social media tools;
&#61623; To generate debate on the main themes of the Conference;
&#61623; To create network between professionals and between New Media and
Audiovisual sector
projects;
&#61623; To promote and distribute videos, short films and documentaries made with
attention to new
expressive languages and the possibility of producing and distributing low
cost offered by
new technologies and digital media;
&#61623; To provide media with interesting content to our stakeholders, to connote
the event with
strong emotional impact values (cinema, 3d, new media, open source software,
etc ...) and
create moments aggregation associating positive values that make them talk
about us;
&#61623; To stimulate reflection on the future of media and new technologies
through questions like
&quot;how can we help the next generation of creators get their stuff in front of
an audience?&quot; or
&quot;How can Open Source tools improve the process of production,
post-production and
distribution of content?&quot; and many others.
Monitoring
The Telematics Freedom Foundation and the organization team will use various
tools to monitor
communication strategies towards the target audience and the objectives
proposed by the event:
&#61623; Press Office: The choice of using the services of a professional press
office was made in
order to better promote the event and monitor traditional media such as
newspapers, weekly
journals, etc ... but also to provide PR support to all activities at the
local level that can be
used as a source of news for the press. In addition, this office will be
responsible for
producing press releases, obtaining interviews, keeping daily contact with
key journalists,
continuous updating of information materials, media monitoring and
reporting;
&#61623; Subscriptions at the event and workshop: we will register the number of
members present at
the event and subscribed to all workshops in order to calculate commissions
and to assess
the interest on the arguments presented for a possible second edition of the
event;
&#61623; Twitter is one fast-growing social media tool, and its model of
micro-blogging is able to
provide frequent updates and news on the subject in real-time. It will be
integrated with
Facebook using automatic updates, and the event website will aggregate all
the messages
that Twitter users will post about the event. Through multiple sites that
offer twitter statistics
(tweetpromote.com, twinfluence.com, tweetreach.com, twitter-friends.com,
twittercounter.com, twitterholic.com, tweetstats.com, twitterstats.com,
TwitterMeter.com,
TwitStat . com, TweetVolume.com, etc ...) we will be able to build a profile
of the audience
reached, relevant keywords, and many other information that will help us to
track and focus
on promotion activities to achieve the proposed objectives;
&#61623; Facebook: The event will have its own page on Facebook, where world news
on the
audiovisual sector and information regarding confirmation of workshops and
sessions for
the program event will be published. Facebook offers a dashboard screen to
monitor number
of accesses and user interactions with the page, as well as a messaging
system that will
allow for direct contact with those interested in the event;
&#61623; Website Statistics: The website of the event will gather statistical
information on visits from
users (WebStat and Google Analytics);
&#61623; Statistics of Online Advertising Campaigns: Facebook and Google AdWords
provides
detailed information on the number of clicks in ads in order to assess the
results and impact
of the campaign.
