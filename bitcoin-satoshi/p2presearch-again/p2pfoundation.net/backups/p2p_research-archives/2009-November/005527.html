</I>&gt;<i> on 10/29/09
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is some relatively new sciece out about the origins of oil&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090910084259.htm#at">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090910084259.htm#at</A>&gt;and natural gas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *ScienceDaily (Sep. 12, 2009) &#8212; Researchers at the Royal Institute of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology (KTH) in Stockholm have managed to prove that fossils from
</I>&gt;<i> animals and plants are not necessary for crude oil and natural gas to be
</I>&gt;<i> generated. The findings are revolutionary since this means, on the one hand,
</I>&gt;<i> that it will be much easier to find these sources of energy and, on the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, that they can be found all over the globe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Using our research we can even say where oil could be found in Sweden,&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> says Vladimir Kutcherov, a professor at the Division of Energy Technology at
</I>&gt;<i> KTH.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Together with two research colleagues, Vladimir Kutcherov has simulated the
</I>&gt;<i> process involving pressure and heat that occurs naturally in the inner
</I>&gt;<i> layers of the earth, the process that generates hydrocarbon, the primary
</I>&gt;<i> component in oil and natural gas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to Vladimir Kutcherov, the findings are a clear indication that
</I>&gt;<i> the oil supply is not about to end, which researchers and experts in the
</I>&gt;<i> field have long feared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He adds that there is no way that fossil oil, with the help of gravity or
</I>&gt;<i> other forces, could have seeped down to a depth of 10.5 kilometers in the
</I>&gt;<i> state of Texas, for example, which is rich in oil deposits. As Vladimir
</I>&gt;<i> Kutcherov sees it, this is further proof, alongside his own research
</I>&gt;<i> findings, of the genesis of these energy sources &#8211; that they can be created
</I>&gt;<i> in other ways than via fossils.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well isn't that interesting. So called fossil fuels may not be from fossils
</I>&gt;<i> after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would tend to confirm the work of Thomas Gold and Freeman Dyson:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Deep Hot Biosphere : The Myth of Fossil Fuels&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387952535?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poweandcont-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0387952535">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387952535?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poweandcont-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0387952535</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What other findings do we have that might add further confirmation? There
</I>&gt;<i> is some other work done in Sweden&lt;<A HREF="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=42117">http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=42117</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *When Gold proposed this theory in the early 1980s, few scientists took
</I>&gt;<i> him seriously. However, he did persuade the Swedish State Power Board to
</I>&gt;<i> drill into a slab of granite fractured by an ancient meteor impact. Since
</I>&gt;<i> oil is supposed to be found only in sedimentary rocks, it was a good test of
</I>&gt;<i> Gold's theory. If gas is coming up from deep in the Earth, it might be
</I>&gt;<i> expected to accumulate beneath the dense granite cap, and migrate slowly up
</I>&gt;<i> through any fissures, perhaps turning into oil or tar. In the event, the
</I>&gt;<i> prospectors did strike oil - about 12 tons of it. This was not enough to
</I>&gt;<i> make the well commercially successful, but it did confirm that Gold was on
</I>&gt;<i> to something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was not the Swedish oil that proved the most significant discovery
</I>&gt;<i> though. Mixed in with the sludge at the bottom of the well, at a depth of
</I>&gt;<i> over 6 km, was a large quantity of magnetite - a reduced form of iron oxide
</I>&gt;<i> often associated with bacterial activity. After further investigation, Gold
</I>&gt;<i> announced to the world that life exists not only on the surface of our
</I>&gt;<i> planet but, in microbial form, deep inside the crust too.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah but that is not all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seem to be more than a few oil wells in the world that refuse to run
</I>&gt;<i> dry &lt;<A HREF="http://hubpages.com/hub/Peak-Oil-or-Nonsense">http://hubpages.com/hub/Peak-Oil-or-Nonsense</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Mystery in the Gulf
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 1973 oil was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 80 miles
</I>&gt;<i> south of Louisiana known as Eugene Island 330. Producing 15,000 barrels per
</I>&gt;<i> day, it was thought the well had seen better days when in 1989 its output
</I>&gt;<i> dropped to 4,000 barrels per day. In 1990 the production of the well
</I>&gt;<i> increased to about 13,000 barrels daily and has held steady. Although its
</I>&gt;<i> output has slightly dropped it still refuses to run dry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Want a Refill - Is That Possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scientist working at the site discovered two important changes in the oil
</I>&gt;<i> properties. Its age was was more recent than in previous years and its
</I>&gt;<i> temperature was hotter. Using 3-D seismic technology scientist found a deep
</I>&gt;<i> fault at the bottom of the well. What they saw startled, intrigued, and
</I>&gt;<i> forced them to rethink the origins of oil. What they clearly saw was a deep
</I>&gt;<i> fault gushing oil and refilling the well. There was no debate about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mystery in the Mideast and Elsewhere
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's been said that the Mideast oil was a finite resource and could last 40
</I>&gt;<i> or 50 years at best. Yet over the past 25 years, reserves have more than
</I>&gt;<i> doubled. With no new wells geologist have been hard pressed to explain why
</I>&gt;<i> and it appears there is no end in sight. These fields have been methodically
</I>&gt;<i> exploited since the first gusher was discovered. Today, OPEC is pumping over
</I>&gt;<i> 30 million barrels of oil per day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cook Island in the Gulf of Mexico and oil fields in Uzbekistan are other
</I>&gt;<i> examples of wells that refuse to dry out. Many wells around the world are
</I>&gt;<i> refilling.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peak oil? I dunno. Maybe not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then there is the biology of the Gulf of Mexico&lt;<A HREF="http://goldismoney.info/forums/showthread.php?t=20160">http://goldismoney.info/forums/showthread.php?t=20160</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> We hear a lot about killer oil spills. But what if oil is life? Here is an
</I>&gt;<i> article about all the oil seeping out of the gulf of Mexico.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The discovery of abundant life where scientists expected a deserted
</I>&gt;<i> seafloor also suggested that the seeps are a long-duration phenomenon.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, the clams are thought to be about 100 years old, and the tube worms
</I>&gt;<i> may live as long as 600 years, or more, Kennicutt said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The surprises kept pouring in as the researchers explored further and in
</I>&gt;<i> more detail using research submarines. In some areas, the
</I>&gt;<i> methane-metabolizing organisms even build up structures that resemble coral
</I>&gt;<i> reefs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has long been known by geologists and oil industry workers that seeps
</I>&gt;<i> exist. In Southern California, for example, there are seeps near Santa
</I>&gt;<i> Barbara, at a geologic feature called Coal Oil Point. And, Roberts said,
</I>&gt;<i> it&#180;s clear that &quot;the Gulf of Mexico leaks like a sieve. You can&#180;t take a
</I>&gt;<i> submarine dive without running into an oil or gas seep. And on a calm day,
</I>&gt;<i> you can&#180;t take a boat ride without seeing gigantic oil slicks&quot; on the sea
</I>&gt;<i> surface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Roberts added that natural seepage in places like the Gulf of Mexico &quot;far
</I>&gt;<i> exceeds anything that gets spilled&quot; by oil tankers and other sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The results of this have been a big surprise for me,&quot; said Whelan. &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> never would have expected that the gas is moving up so quickly and what a
</I>&gt;<i> huge effect it has on the whole system.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the oil industry hasn&#180;t shown great enthusiasm for the idea --
</I>&gt;<i> arguing that the upward migration is too slow and too uncommon to do much
</I>&gt;<i> good -- the search for new oil and gas supplies already has been affected,
</I>&gt;<i> Whelan and Kennicutt said. Now, companies scan the sea surface for signs of
</I>&gt;<i> oil slicks that might point to new deposits.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well what do you know. Look for an oil slick, find oil.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you do some searching around on your favorite search engine you can find
</I>&gt;<i> lots more of this stuff. Which made me think of the Firesign Theater Album: Everything
</I>&gt;<i> You Know Is Wrong.&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BNDP?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poweandcont-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006BNDP">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BNDP?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poweandcont-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006BNDP</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peak oil? Probably more like peak hysteria. Well it used to sell
</I>&gt;<i> newspapers. Today? Not so much &lt;<A HREF="http://www.newspaperdeathwatch.com/">http://www.newspaperdeathwatch.com/</A>&gt;.
