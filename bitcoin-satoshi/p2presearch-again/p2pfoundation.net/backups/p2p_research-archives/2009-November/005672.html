I don't see how you get to that. When Benjamin Franklin invented bifocals or 
the Franklin stove, I think he was just trying to make the world a better 
place and ease the burdens on people around him or increase their comfort 
and happiness. He refused to patent them on purpose.
<A HREF="http://inventors.about.com/od/fstartinventors/ss/Franklin_invent_2.htm">http://inventors.about.com/od/fstartinventors/ss/Franklin_invent_2.htm</A>
&quot;Benjamin Franklin developed a new style of stove with a hoodlike enclosure 
in the front and an airbox in the rear. The new stove and reconfiguration of 
the flues allowed for a more efficient fire, one that used one quarter as 
much wood and generated twice as much heat. When offered a patent for the 
fireplace's design, Benjamin Franklin turned it down. He did not want to 
make a profit. He wanted all people to benefit from his invention.&quot;

&gt;<i> Innovation, by comparison, is a messy term that usually is linked in
</I>&gt;<i> economic literatures to productivity improvements.  Output changes may be
</I>&gt;<i> influenced by inventions but they may be influenced by other things as
</I>&gt;<i> well...better processes for instance, which are generally not
</I>&gt;<i> inventions...though they legally may be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are not going to subscribe to economics or law conventions, you've
</I>&gt;<i> simply got to define your terms.  Else, no one can make sense of any of it.
</I>
I linked to two Wikipedia articles. :-)

&gt;<i> Without a theory of market, I have no idea how you measure output changes in
</I>&gt;<i> relationship to utility.   The crisis of P2P political theory is that it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't know what it wants to ask for.  Underneath it needs to be happiness
</I>&gt;<i> theory (e.g. a Dalai Lama sort of idealism) or utility theory, or equity
</I>&gt;<i> theory or something that is a goal set.  Without that, we generate noise in
</I>&gt;<i> a dark vacuum to no effect.  What do we want to happen?
</I>
I prefer an aesthetic measurement. :-)

As I see it, most decisions come down to aesthetics. :-)

&gt;<i> VC firms are trying to realize one goal only--economic returns.  
</I>
Agreed. Except even there, personal interests can come into play...

Money is a tool. Some people know how to use it well to effect social 
change. Others treat money like an end in itself.

&gt;<i> A
</I>&gt;<i> foundation like the B &amp; M Gates Foundation is striving to solve certain
</I>&gt;<i> well-stated problems.  
</I>
Or have they picked the problems because they relate to other goals or values?

&gt;<i> Governments are generally in relatively unclear
</I>
Constitutions? Judicial rulings?

&gt;<i> businesses...that's why a lot of people don't like them spending money.
</I>
?

&gt;<i> Right now, P2P theory is like a government.  No one can be sure it is trying
</I>&gt;<i> to do something positive.
</I>
I'm not sure the theory aspect of it matters? Maybe I just don't see where 
you are coming from on this.
