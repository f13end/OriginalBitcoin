&gt;<i> Something I wrote today to someone else, but thought I'd post here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is common in some countries to have a tax on media or internet to fund
</I>&gt;<i> musicians. It's been proposed in other countries, even for the USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Can you name a single country where this is actually the case?



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403182528/notabug.com/2002/acs/">http://web.archive.org/web/20050403182528/notabug.com/2002/acs/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> This is the proposal that most seem to agree on and that best solves all
</I>&gt;<i> the known issues.
</I>&gt;<i>  People with broadband Internet connections pay an extra $3-$5 on their
</I>&gt;<i> bill (the amount is calculated by determining how much money is lost by
</I>&gt;<i> Internet downloads and dividing it by the number of Internet connections),
</I>&gt;<i> which is given to the operators of the system (&quot;MiniPay&quot;). (Optionally, a
</I>&gt;<i> similar charge can be added to other Internet connections, blank media,
</I>&gt;<i> burners, computers, etc.) In return, they receive a &quot;blinded signature
</I>&gt;<i> token&quot; that allows them to tell MiniPay what they're listening to without
</I>&gt;<i> cheating (the token can only be used once) and without knowing who submitted
</I>&gt;<i> it (the ISP was &quot;blinded&quot; when it gave it out, so they don't which they gave
</I>&gt;<i> to who). The token is sent to them automatically and electronically and is
</I>&gt;<i> held onto by their MP3 player (e.g. iTunes).
</I>&gt;<i>  Copyright holders, when creating new songs and movies, submit a copy to
</I>&gt;<i> MiniPay. MiniPay uses an audio/video &quot;fingerprinting&quot; technology to
</I>&gt;<i> calculate a short number which identifies the song. They store this with
</I>&gt;<i> information about the copyright holder, so they know who to distribute
</I>&gt;<i> payments to later.
</I>&gt;<i>  Now people surf the Internet, downloading whatever songs they like,
</I>&gt;<i> however they like, and listening to them. Their MP3 player keeps track of
</I>&gt;<i> how many times they listen to each song (identified by using the same
</I>&gt;<i> fingerprinting technology as MiniPay). If they use portable devices, the
</I>&gt;<i> devices keep track and submit the information back to the MP3 player. If
</I>&gt;<i> multiple computers share an Internet connection, the computers also share
</I>&gt;<i> playcount data. At the end of the month, the computer collects all the data
</I>&gt;<i> and anonymously submits it to MiniPay with the token.
</I>&gt;<i>  MiniPay divides up however much the token is worth (the $3-$5 charge less
</I>&gt;<i> operating expenses) in proportion to how much each song is played. Then it
</I>&gt;<i> looks at who holds the copyright to each song and deposits the money in
</I>&gt;<i> their account.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, give up some money to musicians, that's OK with me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Give up privacy as to what is listened to? Very questionable that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;anonymous blinded tokens&quot; would really be such. Probably various ways to
</I>&gt;<i> game that system with stuffing the ballot boxes somehow (mentioned later in
</I>&gt;<i> the page, I see.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you attribute value to mashups? What of using music in products?
</I>&gt;<i> What about chilling effects in making similar things? Some deep issues left
</I>&gt;<i> unaddressed. Some say Jazz could never have been created today, with people
</I>&gt;<i> learning from each other and building on each other. The chilling effects of
</I>&gt;<i> copyright would prevent it. Most musicians (the 99%+ who never see the big
</I>&gt;<i> bucks) lose out from strong copyright because they can't build on each
</I>&gt;<i> others works the way the old time Jazz musicians could.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, that is just about music. What about software, news, videos,
</I>&gt;<i> contributions to blogs or comments? Running a web site? And so on?
</I>&gt;<i> What about compensating people for making the decision about what musicians
</I>&gt;<i> to compensate (playing a music critic role)? Why draw an arbitrary line to
</I>&gt;<i> one type of activity, making original music, and then ignore every other
</I>&gt;<i> positive contribution people make to the public good in other ways?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say the proposal quoted above was tried. There are 300 million people
</I>&gt;<i> in the USA, and *all* pay US$5 for a connection, that's US$1.5 billion a
</I>&gt;<i> month, or US$18 billion a year. How much would go for overhead? That's
</I>&gt;<i> probably only US$10 billion to artists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The US government budget is now about US$3 trillion.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The computer sales industry globally is hundreds of billions of dollars or
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> US$10 billion a year is nothing. It is the tail wagging the dog, or even
</I>&gt;<i> the flea wagging the tail, with all the power media executives have had over
</I>&gt;<i> Congress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not just pay US$10 billion out of general tax revenue as grants to
</I>&gt;<i> people who want to make free stuff? That was done during the 1930s Great
</I>&gt;<i> Depression. It paid for a lot of art, photography, recordings, and music,
</I>&gt;<i> some of it public domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then everyone will want that support. So, give it to everyone who asks.
</I>&gt;<i> What does a musician care if other people get paid to freeload if they get
</I>&gt;<i> supported enough to do their own art? Then we are back to a basic income.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, is, say, caring for your sister's kid or your sick Mom any less
</I>&gt;<i> freeloading than making music for the internet? There are lots of implicit
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions about what is worthwhile here...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's examine a basic income in the USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About one third of the US GDP of $14.4 trillion could be allocated to a
</I>&gt;<i> basic income, money coming from general taxes, leasing goverment land and
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum and other public assets like fishing rights, import/export tariffs,
</I>&gt;<i> sin taxes (like a US$400 per barrel tax on oil and other carbon sources),
</I>&gt;<i> and putting money directly into circulation instead of banks creating it via
</I>&gt;<i> fractional reserve debt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, that would be about US$5 trillion / 300 million, which is about US$1400
</I>&gt;<i> a month per person, which could replace unemployment, public schools, social
</I>&gt;<i> security, and so on. With full health insurance thrown in for US$200 a month
</I>&gt;<i> per person no exceptions (low overhead with single payer plus lots less
</I>&gt;<i> stress and more free time to help peers be healthy), we reduce this to
</I>&gt;<i> US$1200 a month cash and free-to-the-user comprehensive health care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And there is still 2/3 of the GDP for people to compete for if they really
</I>&gt;<i> think competition is a good way to run a society. So, about US$10 trillion a
</I>&gt;<i> year of the US economy is paid through labor or interest on capital.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems a lot more straightforward than inventing tokens and popularity
</I>&gt;<i> horseraces and so on just for music, and then maybe doing the same for news,
</I>&gt;<i> websites, youtube videos, free software etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's true that open source, as a public good, is providing lots of value
</I>&gt;<i> but getting not enough funding, so this proposal would help fix that without
</I>&gt;<i> requiring Google and other big companies to fund it all:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Open source: Big value, not big money&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10387512-16.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10387512-16.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Google: The open-source savior we deserve&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10388101-16.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10388101-16.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, why should a musician get compensated on current airplay when their
</I>&gt;<i> stuff might only be popular in ten years, or even a hundred years, after
</I>&gt;<i> they are dead? Lots of assumptions there...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could a US musician live on US$1200 a month per person in his/her family
</I>&gt;<i> (with full medical care) and devote himself/herself full time to music?
</I>&gt;<i> Well, let's say he/she has a spouse and two kids. So, he'd/she'd be living
</I>&gt;<i> on US$4800 a month, which is about the median US income. He/she might
</I>&gt;<i> homeschool so as to not have to pay tuition to private school for his kids.
</I>&gt;<i> He/she could devote a lot of time to his music, and maybe his/her spouse
</I>&gt;<i> could devote time to making free software. It's not living high on the hog
</I>&gt;<i> to live off of US$57K a year and homeschool two kids, but no doubt they
</I>&gt;<i> could scrape by. They would only need one car, or might choose to live
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere they did not need a car at all (it's not like there is a daily
</I>&gt;<i> commute to &quot;work&quot; or &quot;school&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, even &quot;millionaires&quot; might be better off under this plan:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[p2p-research] Basic income from a millionaire's perspective?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current system makes no sense. This sort of music fee is a
</I>&gt;<i> half-measure, from a narrow point of view. It's like when labor unions
</I>&gt;<i> create their own private welfare state in a big company and let the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the people in the country who are unemployed twist in the wind, while person
</I>&gt;<i> by person jobs are lost to automation or competition, as happened in
</I>&gt;<i> Detroit. Media taxes try to be a middle ground, but when an ice flow is
</I>&gt;<i> splitting in two, being in the middle may just get you dumped in cold water.
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
