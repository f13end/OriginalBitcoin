<PRE>thanks Paul, pretty sure I will never write that book though ..&lt;g&gt;

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for [Eric] von Hippel, before him preciously few people recognized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the power of social innovation by users, it still seems a pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental contribution for me, especially as he saw it years before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others started acknowledging it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just adding my work as a footnote. :-) That work was explained in part to
</I>&gt;<i> another von Hippel (Frank) and grew in part out of his public policy class
</I>&gt;<i> at the Princeton Woodrow Wilson School in 1988, though it had earlier roots
</I>&gt;<i> like an (unpublished) essay I wrote called &quot;The Vertical Corporation&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> some earlier work, even back to Steve Slaby's class in Princeton on &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Technological Imperative of the Arms Race&quot; around 1984 or so, and roots
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> before that in reading James P. Hogan's writings, like &quot;The Two Faces of
</I>&gt;<i> Tomorrow&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I presented there the idea of a self-replicating non-profit that built a
</I>&gt;<i> network of information about sustainability and put it into practice
</I>&gt;<i> locally, and also in an application for a MacArthur graduate fellowship to
</I>&gt;<i> continue that work, and pretty much everyone thought it was crazy, with no
</I>&gt;<i> hope of success. :-) Frank was also concerned it would lead to weapons
</I>&gt;<i> proliferation to have distributed manufacturing like I outlined. I had a
</I>&gt;<i> Hypercard prototype I built back then of &quot;Stella&quot;, too (mostly just a
</I>&gt;<i> static
</I>&gt;<i> demo, and named after an 80 year old Countess I was hanging out with then
</I>&gt;<i> who had an interest is solar energy and other sustainable technology).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example one (from 1988):
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/princeton-graduate-school-plans.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/princeton-graduate-school-plans.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Various projects at Brown, MIT, Stanford, Bellcore, Xanadu, and Apple
</I>&gt;<i> have produced hypertext information management systems. These seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> future of information management. I would like to put such a system on the
</I>&gt;<i> IRIS [an early Silicon Graphics Workstation model of which there were many
</I>&gt;<i> in a networked classroom lab] so that people at Princeton can use it and
</I>&gt;<i> extend it. This should take a year's work, and probably cost around
</I>&gt;<i> $50,000.
</I>&gt;<i> NSF or Apple should fund this. We could put a hypercard compatible system
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> IRIS in the case of Apple. ..
</I>&gt;<i> 10. Beyond these individual tools, we need a good system for allowing
</I>&gt;<i> multiple people to work together on a project on the IRIS's (or across
</I>&gt;<i> campus). This entails producing workgroup software for managing shared
</I>&gt;<i> databases, electronic mail, and other communications and coordination
</I>&gt;<i> systems. To get into this will involve at least a year and probably
</I>&gt;<i> $50,000.
</I>&gt;<i> Various electronic mail companies and software houses, as well as major
</I>&gt;<i> companies and governmental agencies may be interested in funding various
</I>&gt;<i> parts of this. Suggestions are Dupont, Da Vinci Systems, Apple, IBM, DEC,
</I>&gt;<i> NASA, and Ford.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See also:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Jakob Nielsen has pointed out that HyperCard was really only a hypermedia
</I>&gt;<i> program since its links started from regions on a card, not text objects;
</I>&gt;<i> actual HTML-style text hyperlinks were possible in later versions, but were
</I>&gt;<i> awkward to implement and seldom used. Bill Atkinson later lamented that if
</I>&gt;<i> he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become
</I>&gt;<i> the first Web browser.[5]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example two (from 1990, but representing the earlier ideas, which were in
</I>&gt;<i> two documents for that call, &quot;The Self-Replicating Garden&quot; plus an earlier
</I>&gt;<i> very different version):

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  Using Stella, Sunrise is developing a technological web to allow the
</I>&gt;<i> Institute to rely on sustainable technology for 90% of its operations.
</I>&gt;<i> Sustainable technology is technology that can be used indefinitely without
</I>&gt;<i> harm to the environment and which can be recycled or disposed of without
</I>&gt;<i> environmental damage. Every system developed or adapted will be put into
</I>&gt;<i> Stella and made public domain for anyone to use. These systems would
</I>&gt;<i> eventually include housing, food production, paper use, energy use,
</I>&gt;<i> transportation, communications, and computing. Stella would be used to
</I>&gt;<i> assess priorities and degrees of sustainability for all the technology the
</I>&gt;<i> institute relies on.
</I>&gt;<i>  Like any living system, Sunrise will grow over time. Sunrise's growth
</I>&gt;<i> strategy will be to replicate itself in other communities. Each institute
</I>&gt;<i> will have a Stella system, and the Stella systems will all communicate with
</I>&gt;<i> each other to share innovations. In this fashion, Sunrise can help many
</I>&gt;<i> communities increase their use of sustainable technology.
</I>&gt;<i>  As the institute grows, it will market sustainable technology it has
</I>&gt;<i> invented or discovered to the surrounding community on an ability to pay
</I>&gt;<i> basis. In addition it will provide consulting to organizations increasing
</I>&gt;<i> their sustainability and decreasing their negative impact on the
</I>&gt;<i> environment.
</I>&gt;<i>  When established, the work environment at Sunrise offers the following to
</I>&gt;<i> employees and their dependants: food, shelter, energy, tools, work space,
</I>&gt;<i> health care, day care, transportation, communication, computation,
</I>&gt;<i> household
</I>&gt;<i> goods, education, a retirement plan, creative companionship, and a small
</I>&gt;<i> salary for a few luxuries. While no one at Sunrise will get rich, Sunrise
</I>&gt;<i> employees know they and their families will be provided for. The Sunrise
</I>&gt;<i> environment is experimental: the employees live with, work with, and test
</I>&gt;<i> technology they have discovered and developed. Since all work is in the
</I>&gt;<i> public domain, Sunrise employees know they work in service of humanity and
</I>&gt;<i> not a specific corporation. Sunrise employees have no fears that some
</I>&gt;<i> organization might shelve their ideas and deprive them of rights to use
</I>&gt;<i> them. By setting a high degree of self-reliance as a goal, Sunrise helps
</I>&gt;<i> assure stability for its employees no matter what happens to the larger
</I>&gt;<i> economy.
</I>&gt;<i>  While not-for-profit, Sunrise still needs money to operate. Sunrise's
</I>&gt;<i> money will come from the following areas: 1. Donations 2. Grants 3.
</I>&gt;<i> Individual and Corporate Memberships 5. Proceeds from selling sustainable
</I>&gt;<i> technology 6. Proceeds from consulting on sustainable technology 7.
</I>&gt;<i> Proceeds
</I>&gt;<i> from workshops and tours 8. Proceeds from selling access to databases [not
</I>&gt;<i> from selling the data!]
</I>&gt;<i>  On an operating level, Sunrise will strive to utilize volunteers,
</I>&gt;<i> exchange services with other non-profits, and supply its needs from the
</I>&gt;<i> in-house productivity of its own staff whenever possible. Since Sunrise
</I>&gt;<i> provides most of the necessities of its staff and their dependants,
</I>&gt;<i> salaries
</I>&gt;<i> can be low.
</I>&gt;<i>  By focusing on developing, testing, and using new methods of production,
</I>&gt;<i> Sunrise will acquire over time a physical infrastruture that is an
</I>&gt;<i> embodiement of the ideas in Stella. This infrastructure will include
</I>&gt;<i> machine
</I>&gt;<i> tools, housing, a seed bank, breeding stock, energy production facilities,
</I>&gt;<i> recycling centers, biological sewage treatment facilities, day care
</I>&gt;<i> centers,
</I>&gt;<i> computer hardware, meeting rooms, vehicles, and so forth. Employees using
</I>&gt;<i> this capital along with Stella will be able to extend the capital base at
</I>&gt;<i> times without the necessity for large amounts of money. This is possible
</I>&gt;<i> through the use of collected energy applied to recycle materials and
</I>&gt;<i> manufacture them into needed items that more than make up for the wear and
</I>&gt;<i> tear (overhead) involved in creating them.
</I>&gt;<i>  This is the fourty year timeline of goals for Sunrise:
</I>&gt;<i> 1990 - 50 members, computer workstation, greenhouse, 100 items in Stella
</I>&gt;<i> 1991 - Several staff, ten volunteers, 200 members, several workstations, on
</I>&gt;<i> site housing and day care, 1000 items in Stella
</I>&gt;<i> 1992 - 10,000 items in Stella. On site energy production
</I>&gt;<i> 1993 - 50 staff on site, 50,000 items in Stella
</I>&gt;<i> 1995 - 200 staff on 2 sites, 100,000 items in Stella
</I>&gt;<i> 2001 - 10 institutes, 1 million items in Stella, Desert Institute.
</I>&gt;<i> 2011 - 30 Institutes, 10 million, Antarctic Institute
</I>&gt;<i> 2033 - 100 Institutes, 100 million, O'Neill Habitat Institute
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say my &quot;evil&quot; plans are ahead of schedule in some ways at this point,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if I lay metaphorical claim to all the p2p stuff going on and
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia and so on. :-) That's mostly just for fun, of course, but with a
</I>&gt;<i> tiny kernel of truth in the sense that I was, for a time, part of that
</I>&gt;<i> larger social network around Princeton and the political and energy/physics
</I>&gt;<i> community, like how the Pointrel system has a relation to WordNet. Related
</I>&gt;<i> humor at the end here:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many people had seeds of ideas, some very few were on fertile soil (like at
</I>&gt;<i> CERN or MIT), but those grew, and grew, and grew. Or the seeds were just
</I>&gt;<i> better and healthier in some way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia has about three million items in English, and many more in other
</I>&gt;<i> languages, so it is close to that prediction/intent/desire of ten million
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> items in the public domain (or now, free licenses). But the web itself is
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> much more, of course. So, is that timeline above for saving the world from
</I>&gt;<i> itself on schedule, or even ahead of schedule? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Frank von Hippel's class, someone recommended I read &quot;Walden II&quot; by B.F.
</I>&gt;<i> Skinner and implied that was what I was talking about (there are some
</I>&gt;<i> parallels, especially about sustainable technology), same as Ryan and
</I>&gt;<i> others
</I>&gt;<i> often seem to read coercion into anything about cooperation. Still, the
</I>&gt;<i> competitive landscape we have is terribly coercive, as Bob Black points
</I>&gt;<i> out,
</I>&gt;<i> from 1985, so it is hard to get much worse on a hours-spent-under-coercion
</I>&gt;<i> basis:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/abolition.html">http://www.whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/abolition.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ... Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have
</I>&gt;<i> rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren't free like we
</I>&gt;<i> are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or else, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance.
</I>&gt;<i> State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The
</I>&gt;<i> officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or
</I>&gt;<i> private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers
</I>&gt;<i> report
</I>&gt;<i> regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i>  And so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern
</I>&gt;<i> workplace. The liberals and conservatives and Libertarians who lament
</I>&gt;<i> totalitarianism are phonies and hypocrites. There is more freedom in any
</I>&gt;<i> moderately de-Stalinized dictatorship than there is in the ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> American
</I>&gt;<i> workplace. You find the same sort of hierarchy and discipline in an office
</I>&gt;<i> or factory as you do in a prison or a monastery. In fact, as Foucault and
</I>&gt;<i> others have shown, prisons and factories came in at about the same time,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> their operators consciously borrowed from each other's control techniques.
</I>&gt;<i> A
</I>&gt;<i> worker is a part-time slave. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, I was wondering about those sorts of issues, like how do you deal
</I>&gt;<i> with people who want to freeload, and it was very grand (or even grandiose)
</I>&gt;<i> in the sense of transforming the world just starting from one seed and a
</I>&gt;<i> growing public domain of information related to it, so I can't say they
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> entirely wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've since realized, freeloading just is not a problem:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> But what about all the &quot;slackers&quot; who will consume without giving back? The
</I>&gt;<i> answer is just, &quot;So what?&quot; Why not have pity on such people who are stuck
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> such an embarrassingly juvenile state of mind? My mom, a hard worker,
</I>&gt;<i> dreamed of being a slacker in a big house with servants. You know where she
</I>&gt;<i> found her dream? A nursing home. :-( So, be careful what you wish for,
</I>&gt;<i> slacker wannabees. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  If a few can supply the many, then, so what of the slackers? Who cares?
</I>&gt;<i> Why build a whole mythology around slackers? And surprisingly, there may be
</I>&gt;<i> less slackers than one might expect, because when you have the freedom to
</I>&gt;<i> make things your way, without a &quot;boss&quot;, there is often a lot of fun to be
</I>&gt;<i> had in making things. Just look at all the kids making free music for the
</I>&gt;<i> internet these days. Or people writing web pages. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  Examples like the Israeli Kibbutzim have already shown in the past that
</I>&gt;<i> even with hard manual labor, there are always a bunch of schmucks (like
</I>&gt;<i> maybe even myself and my wife, or many others already working in
</I>&gt;<i> non-profits :-)
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/summary_gwi.html">http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/summary_gwi.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> who are willing to work hard even with apparent slackers in their face.
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, Kibbutzim had problems with slackers, but modern automated robotic
</I>&gt;<i> technology changes the nature of that situation:
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=agricultural+robot">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=agricultural+robot</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (and without bringing in migrant laborers to exploit and expose to
</I>&gt;<i> pesticides). And how hard can it be to sit in your GPS-driven
</I>&gt;<i> air-conditioned tractor and listen to free music? Or even make some more
</I>&gt;<i> music of your own in between keeping an eye on how the robots are doing?
</I>&gt;<i>  This is the world the prospective Princeton student is probably imagining
</I>&gt;<i> these days as in their future -- or will be soon. :-) Robot tractors. Free
</I>&gt;<i> music. GNU/Linux everywhere. Slackers who only take stuff and don't make
</I>&gt;<i> stuff as being &quot;so junior high&quot; or &quot;so nursing home&quot;. Essentially, these
</I>&gt;<i> kids are imagining (or will soon) a John Lennon &quot;Imagine&quot; sort of world --
</I>&gt;<i> with abundance and security for all. With robot tractors able to get higher
</I>&gt;<i> yields from less land and less water through precision farming, why fight
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> much about the agricultural fields or river water? With nanotech solar
</I>&gt;<i> panels and nanotech near-perfect insulation, why fight about the oil
</I>&gt;<i> fields?
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Times change; as I see it, aspects of what I outlined are what is
</I>&gt;<i> happening,
</I>&gt;<i> but in a differently networked way, not connected to a grand plan of a
</I>&gt;<i> single self-replicating non-profit (although it is interesting to see what
</I>&gt;<i> is being discussed now on this list about connected p2p related research
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> social centers). What I outlined was more hierarchical in a way (one
</I>&gt;<i> company), but what is happening is a lot more networked and chaordic. And
</I>&gt;<i> what is happening is better, at this point. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of this is a matter of perspective. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And my whole proposal may seem a little nutty looking back on it, and
</I>&gt;<i> certainly over-ambitious, but so was trillions spent on nuclear weapons to
</I>&gt;<i> blow us all up, which is what I was responding to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, we still have another two years to get that Antarctic P2P Media
</I>&gt;<i> Institute up and running, according to that timeline. :-) Could I lay claim
</I>&gt;<i> to Arcosanti intellectually as the desert institute? :-) And could I lay
</I>&gt;<i> claim to the entire Debian GNU/Linux project as &quot;staff&quot;? Then this
</I>&gt;<i> exponential world domination plan would be right on schedule. Even ahead of
</I>&gt;<i> schedule. :-) Subject to being a little out of touch with actual reality
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> who is in charge of all that in a chaordic way. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Starbucks, we can increase our profits five-fold...
</I>&gt;<i> SILENCE! I will not tolerate your insolence!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, it was grand... And nutty. As Albert Einstein said, &quot;If at first, the
</I>&gt;<i> idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, just hoping for a footnote in your book as a related p2p grand plan
</I>&gt;<i> that fizzled. :-) Maybe all for the best? :-) Sometimes, we just don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand the bigger picture? :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, I like the way things are happening now better. It's a lot less
</I>&gt;<i> stressful to be a little node in a network than trying to invent and manage
</I>&gt;<i> the whole thing. I'm just a little warped from the process of trying,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'll have some real success when I give up? :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, maybe I became the anti-Princeton, in a sense, somewhere along the
</I>&gt;<i> line? :-) Although, that's only metaphorically, because there were many
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful people at Princeton, and there was an emphasis on networking both
</I>&gt;<i> among the faculty and the alumni (Princeton is especially proud of the
</I>&gt;<i> Alumni network). Somehow, that academic network was often dysfunctional in
</I>&gt;<i> some deep way, even as it produced lots of papers about research results.
</I>&gt;<i> But, it is still powerful. Part of the dysfunction is perhaps values. Part
</I>&gt;<i> of it is perhaps the scarcity assumption. Part of it is the &quot;disciplined
</I>&gt;<i> minds&quot; aspect Jeff Schmidt talks about that relates to the first two. It
</I>&gt;<i> took me a long time to put all those pieces together:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-October/005379.html">http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-October/005379.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though I remember talking about some of this once at an international
</I>&gt;<i> visitor lunch and one woman, from India perhaps, saying how she was very
</I>&gt;<i> surprised to hear someone at Princeton talking about issues of distributed
</I>&gt;<i> technology or sustainability and so on. Obviously, people in other
</I>&gt;<i> countries
</I>&gt;<i> have been talking about this for a long time, including inspired by EF
</I>&gt;<i> Schumacher's work (which I read too).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a place like Princeton worked from an abundance assumption, it would be
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> very different place, even with just all the same people and same
</I>&gt;<i> buildings.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know it well anymore (just from occasionally glancing at the alumni
</I>&gt;<i> magazine or interacting with some alumns online), so I can hope it has
</I>&gt;<i> changed. My little effort in that direction, even now:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/reading-between-the-lines.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, I feel it will, like the rest of the world is doing, and Princeton
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> follow or become irrelevant. At least, I hope it will. It may still take
</I>&gt;<i> more years of unnecessary suffering, but, compared to when I did my stuff
</I>&gt;<i> there, twenty years later there is an &quot;office of sustainability&quot; there now
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/sustainability/">http://www.princeton.edu/sustainability/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and probably in another twenty years there will be an &quot;office of peer
</I>&gt;<i> produced free content promotion&quot;. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the same is probably true for *any* university in terms of research.
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> some have been closer to that in the past (even then, if I had been smarter
</I>&gt;<i> and more social, I could have found one, even on the US East coast, like
</I>&gt;<i> UMass Amherst, or wherever, assuming that even made sense).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, as times change, hopefully this very issue becomes more laughable. And
</I>&gt;<i> less meaningful. It hopefully becomes more and more, &quot;Of course
</I>&gt;<i> universities
</I>&gt;<i> assume abundance ideology, that's what they are there for, to help create
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> abundance of creative thinkers and doers and free ideas and related
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically mutually secure infrastructure. How could they be anything
</I>&gt;<i> else?&quot; Well, someday...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We try ideas. We learn. We move on (or try to).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest issue about my plan above was, as I say on one of those web
</I>&gt;<i> pages, was realizing the difference between having a right as an employee
</I>&gt;<i> (who can be fired at will) and having a right as a citizen. And that's
</I>&gt;<i> really, in its deepest way, where the idea broke down. So, that's why that
</I>&gt;<i> corporate model (even as a non-profit) could never be what I hoped for it.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea there was like a basic income, or really, perhaps more like
</I>&gt;<i> Charles
</I>&gt;<i> Fourier's Phalanst&#232;res, but such an idea is more secure as a right of
</I>&gt;<i> citizenship than a right of being an employee.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, it is just creating a private welfare state, like many unions do
</I>&gt;<i> within one company, or like artists do when they just lobby for arts
</I>&gt;<i> funding
</I>&gt;<i> but not a basic income for all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, there is one difference -- the idea of a free commons of public
</I>&gt;<i> domain information. Even if you were &quot;fired&quot; from such a company, you would
</I>&gt;<i> still have access to all that knowledge. So, there is at least some equity
</I>&gt;<i> there, even in that old idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The core ideas was that a sustainable, secure, and self-replicating
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure based around public domain knowledge would soon replace the
</I>&gt;<i> unsustainable insecure proprietary and dying infrastructure we had. And,
</I>&gt;<i> slowly, something like that is happening. And it is a beautiful thing to
</I>&gt;<i> see, even among the doom-and-gloom in the mainstream and even alternative
</I>&gt;<i> press. :-) And even if, for the most part, I've just been watching it from
</I>&gt;<i> the sidelines, and making a small contribution here and there (like with
</I>&gt;<i> our
</I>&gt;<i> free garden simulator, such as it is -- we had much higher hopes for new
</I>&gt;<i> versions, etc. that never happened).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm glad to see sustainability and peer production all happening,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it is some other way. It is the realization of the best aspiration
</I>&gt;<i> for the university ideal, and the enterprise of science and shared
</I>&gt;<i> publications to a common library. In that sense, the ideas I outlined were
</I>&gt;<i> just a reflection of the best aspirations of the community around me at
</I>&gt;<i> Princeton. And, even if the global physical infrastructure is not
</I>&gt;<i> self-replicating, through the web, in some sense, the ideological
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure of abundance ideology (and the hope for that best aspiration
</I>&gt;<i> of free universities) has been self-replicating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back then, I did not understand that mythology is as important, if not more
</I>&gt;<i> so, than physical things. So, all the papers people here are writing, and
</I>&gt;<i> linking to, and discussing, are all really important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though, at some point, one wants to interlink those with physical
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure. But I think it will happen. It is happening. Even without
</I>&gt;<i> yet more grand plans by me like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Getting Greece and Iceland to be 99% self-sufficient by mass;
</I>&gt;<i> international
</I>&gt;<i> consortium&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> The title derives from a joke early in the series, when Arthur Dent

</I>&gt;<i> consists, in its entirety, of the word &quot;Harmless.&quot; His friend Ford Prefect,

</I>&gt;<i> researching&#8212;somewhat cut due to space restrictions, but still an
</I>&gt;<i> improvement. The revised article, he eventually admits, will simply read
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mostly harmless.&quot; It later turns out that Ford had written a long essay on
</I>&gt;<i> how to have fun on Earth, but the editors in the guide's main office
</I>&gt;<i> building edited everything out. Later in the series, Ford is surprised to
</I>&gt;<i> discover that all of his contribution had been edited back into the Guide
</I>&gt;<i> (which makes no sense for a seemingly demolished planet) prompting his
