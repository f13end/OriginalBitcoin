<PRE>Michel,

My sense is that we are all violently agreeing.  How does Paul differ?  If
you, Fernhout, Eugen, Sam and I agree, then it must be true.  And it is, I
think, a first.

</I>&gt;<i> By JULIA ANGWIN and GEOFFREY A. FOWLER
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia.org is the fifth-most-popular Web site in the world, with roughly
</I>&gt;<i> 325 million monthly visitors. But unprecedented numbers of the millions of
</I>&gt;<i> online volunteers who write, edit and police it are quitting.
</I>&gt;<i> That could have significant implications for the brand of democratization
</I>&gt;<i> that Wikipedia helped to unleash over the Internet -- the empowerment of the
</I>&gt;<i> amateur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> News Hub: Wikipedia Volunteers Quit
</I>&gt;<i> 1:44
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia is extremely popular with the public, but not so much with the
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers who run the site. They're quitting, raising questions about the
</I>&gt;<i> future of Wikipedia, says WSJ.com Senior Technology Editor Julia Angwin.
</I>&gt;<i> Volunteers have been departing the project that bills itself as &quot;the free
</I>&gt;<i> encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot; faster than new ones have been joining,
</I>&gt;<i> and the net losses have accelerated over the past year. In the first three
</I>&gt;<i> months of 2009, the English-language Wikipedia suffered a net loss of more
</I>&gt;<i> than 49,000 editors, compared to a net loss of 4,900 during the same period
</I>&gt;<i> a year earlier, according to Spanish researcher Felipe Ortega, who analyzed
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia's data on the editing histories of its more than three million
</I>&gt;<i> active contributors in 10 languages.
</I>&gt;<i> Eight years after Wikipedia began with a goal to provide everyone in the
</I>&gt;<i> world free access to &quot;the sum of all human knowledge,&quot; the declines in
</I>&gt;<i> participation have raised questions about the encyclopedia's ability to
</I>&gt;<i> continue expanding its breadth and improving its accuracy. Errors and
</I>&gt;<i> deliberate insertions of false information by vandals have undermined its
</I>&gt;<i> reliability.
</I>&gt;<i> Executives at the Wikimedia Foundation, which finances and oversees the
</I>&gt;<i> nonprofit venture, acknowledge the declines, but believe they can continue
</I>&gt;<i> to build a useful encyclopedia with a smaller pool of contributors. &quot;We need
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient people to do the work that needs to be done,&quot; says Sue Gardner,
</I>&gt;<i> executive director of the foundation. &quot;But the purpose of the project is not
</I>&gt;<i> participation.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Digits
</I>&gt;<i> Is Wikipedia Too Unfriendly to Newbies?
</I>&gt;<i> How to Make $55,000 by Giving Away Your Work
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, Wikipedia remains enormously popular among users, with the number
</I>&gt;<i> of Web visitors growing 20% in the 12 months ending in September, according
</I>&gt;<i> to comScore Media Metrix.
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia contributors have been debating widely what is behind the
</I>&gt;<i> declines in volunteers. One factor is that many topics already have been
</I>&gt;<i> written about. Another is the plethora of rules Wikipedia has adopted to
</I>&gt;<i> bring order to its unruly universe -- particularly to reduce infighting
</I>&gt;<i> among contributors about write-ups of controversial subjects and polarizing
</I>&gt;<i> figures.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wikipedia is becoming a more hostile environment,&quot; contends Mr. Ortega, a
</I>&gt;<i> project manager at Libresoft, a research group at the Universidad Rey Juan
</I>&gt;<i> Carlos in Madrid. &quot;Many people are getting burnt out when they have to
</I>&gt;<i> debate about the contents of certain articles again and again.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia's struggles raise questions about the evolution of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;crowdsourcing,&quot; one of the Internet era's most cherished principles.
</I>&gt;<i> Crowdsourcing posits that there is wisdom in aggregating independent
</I>&gt;<i> contributions from multitudes of Web users. It has been promoted as a new
</I>&gt;<i> and better way for large numbers of individuals to collaborate on tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> without the rules and hierarchies of traditional organizations.
</I>&gt;<i> But as it matures, Wikipedia, one of the world's largest crowdsourcing
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives, is becoming less freewheeling and more like the organizations
</I>&gt;<i> it set out to replace. Today, its rules are spelled out across hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> Web pages. Increasingly, newcomers who try to edit are informed that they
</I>&gt;<i> have unwittingly broken a rule -- and find their edits deleted, according to
</I>&gt;<i> a study by researchers at Xerox Corp.
</I>&gt;<i> Journal Community
</I>&gt;<i> discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220; I have an entry on Wiki on some stuff that happened to occur in the
</I>&gt;<i> 1500s. Some of the commentary/corrections that were done were most helpful
</I>&gt;<i> in filling out the article, but the amount of stuff that one had to go
</I>&gt;<i> through hardly justifies the effort when it is volunteer time that I am
</I>&gt;<i> contributing out of my life. &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; William Ledsham
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;People generally have this idea that the wisdom of crowds is a pixie dust
</I>&gt;<i> that you sprinkle on a system and magical things happen,&quot; says Aniket
</I>&gt;<i> Kittur, an assistant professor of human-computer interaction at Carnegie
</I>&gt;<i> Mellon University who has studied Wikipedia and other large online community
</I>&gt;<i> projects. &quot;Yet the more people you throw at a problem, the more difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> you are going to have with coordinating those people. It's too many cooks in
</I>&gt;<i> the kitchen.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, who is chairman emeritus of the foundation,
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledges participation has been declining. But he says it still isn't
</I>&gt;<i> clear to him what the &quot;right&quot; number of volunteer &quot;Wikipedians&quot; should be.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If people think Wikipedia is done,&quot; he says, meaning that with three
</I>&gt;<i> million articles it is hard to find new things to write about, &quot;that's
</I>&gt;<i> substantial. But if the community has become more hostile to newbies, that's
</I>&gt;<i> a correctable problem.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Wales says his top priority is to improve the accuracy of Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;<i> articles. He's pushing a new feature that would require top editors to
</I>&gt;<i> approve all edits before they are displayed on the site. The idea is to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent the kind of vandalism that in January declared Sen. Edward Kennedy's
</I>&gt;<i> death months before his actual passing.

</I>&gt;<i> Jimmy Wales, founder of the online encyclopedia, which is written and
</I>&gt;<i> edited by volunteers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Wales, a onetime options trader in Chicago, founded Wikipedia in 2001
</I>&gt;<i> amid frustration that his effort to create an online encyclopedia was
</I>&gt;<i> hampered by the slow pace of copy-editing and getting feedback from experts.
</I>&gt;<i> He saw Wikipedia as a side project -- a radical experiment with software
</I>&gt;<i> that allows multiple people to edit the same Web page. The term &quot;wiki&quot; comes
</I>&gt;<i> from the Hawaiian word for fast.
</I>&gt;<i> The collaborative software fostered a unique form of online governance. One
</I>&gt;<i> of Wikipedia's principles is that decisions should be made by
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-building. One of the few unbreakable rules is that articles must
</I>&gt;<i> be written from a neutral point of view. Another is that anyone should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to edit most articles. One policy serves as a coda: &quot;Ignore all rules.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikimedia Foundation employs a staff of 34, mostly in San Francisco, to
</I>&gt;<i> run the site's computers, guide its planning and serve as its public face.
</I>&gt;<i> In its fiscal year ended in June, it reported expenses of $5.6 million. It
</I>&gt;<i> funds its operations mostly through donations. Earlier this month, it
</I>&gt;<i> launched a campaign to raise $7.5 million from users.
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia's popularity has strained its consensus-building culture to the
</I>&gt;<i> breaking point. Wikipedia is now a constant target for vandals who spray
</I>&gt;<i> virtual graffiti throughout the site -- everything from political views
</I>&gt;<i> presented as facts to jokes about their friends -- and spammers who try to
</I>&gt;<i> insert marketing messages into articles.
</I>&gt;<i> In 2005, journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. wrote about his own Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> write-up, which unjustly accused him of murder. The resulting bad press was
</I>&gt;<i> a wake-up call. Wikipedians began getting more aggressive about patrolling
</I>&gt;<i> for vandals and blocking suspicious edits, according to Andrew Lih, a
</I>&gt;<i> professor at the University of Southern California and a regular Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> contributor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That helped transform the site into a more hierarchical society where
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers had to negotiate a thicket of new rules. Wikipedia rolled out new
</I>&gt;<i> antivandalism features, including &quot;semiprotection,&quot; which prevents newcomers
</I>&gt;<i> from editing certain controversial articles.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It was easier when I joined in 2004,&quot; says Kat Walsh, a longtime
</I>&gt;<i> contributor who serves on Wikimedia's board of trustees. &quot;Everything was a
</I>&gt;<i> little less complicated.... It's harder and harder for new people to
</I>&gt;<i> adjust.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In 2008, Wikipedia's editors deleted one in four contributions from
</I>&gt;<i> infrequent contributors, up sharply from one in 10 in 2005, according to
</I>&gt;<i> data compiled by social-computing researcher Ed Chi of Xerox's Palo Alto
</I>&gt;<i> Research Center.
</I>&gt;<i> Nina Paley, a New York cartoonist who calls herself an &quot;information
</I>&gt;<i> radical,&quot; had no luck when she tried to post her syndicated comic strips
</I>&gt;<i> from the '90s. She does not copyright their artwork but instead makes money
</I>&gt;<i> on ancillary products and services, making her perfect for Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;<i> free-content culture.
</I>&gt;<i> It took her a few days to decipher Wikipedia's software.&quot;I figured out how
</I>&gt;<i> to do it with this really weird, ugly code,&quot; she says. &quot;I went to bed
</I>&gt;<i> feeling so proud of myself, and I woke up and found it had been deleted
</I>&gt;<i> because it was 'out of scope.'&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> A Wikipedia editor had decided that Ms. Paley's comics didn't meet the
</I>&gt;<i> criteria for educational art. Another editor weighed in with questions about
</I>&gt;<i> whether she had copyright permission for the photo of herself that she
</I>&gt;<i> uploaded. She did.
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, it was decided that Ms. Paley's comics were suitable for the
</I>&gt;<i> site. Samuel Klein, a veteran Wikipedian who serves on the board of
</I>&gt;<i> trustees, intervened and restored her contributions. Mr. Klein says
</I>&gt;<i> experiences like Ms. Paley's happen too often. Mr. Klein says that the
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia community needs to rein in so-called deletionists -- editors who
</I>&gt;<i> shoot first and ask questions later.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wikipedians&quot; from around the world gathered in August at the annual
</I>&gt;<i> Wikimania conference in Buenos Aires
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Wikimedia Foundation says it is seeking to increase participation, but
</I>&gt;<i> that growing the overall number of participants isn't its main focus.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The early days were a gold rush,&quot; says Ms. Gardner, the foundation's
</I>&gt;<i> executive director. &quot;They attracted lots and lots of people, because a new
</I>&gt;<i> person could write about anything.&quot; The encyclopedia isn't finished, she
</I>&gt;<i> says, but the &quot;easy work&quot; of contributing is done.
</I>&gt;<i> To attract new recruits to help with the remaining work, Ms. Gardner has
</I>&gt;<i> hired an outreach team, held seminars to train editors in overlooked
</I>&gt;<i> categories, and launched task forces to seek ways to increase participation
</I>&gt;<i> in markets such as India. The foundation also invested $890,000 in a new
</I>&gt;<i> design for the site, slated to go live in the next few months, that aims to
</I>&gt;<i> make editing easier for contributors who aren't computer-savvy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia on the Decline
</I>&gt;<i> 3:53
</I>&gt;<i> WSJ's Julia Angwin interviews Andrew Lih, author of Wikipedia Revolution,
</I>&gt;<i> about why volunteers are increasingly quitting Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;<i> She says increasing contributor diversity is her top goal. A survey the
</I>&gt;<i> foundation conducted last year determined that the average age of an editor
</I>&gt;<i> is 26.8 years, and that 87% of them are men.
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the task of making Wikipedia more welcoming to newcomers falls to
</I>&gt;<i> Frank Schulenburg, the foundation's head of public outreach. An academic, he
</I>&gt;<i> began contributing to articles about French philosophers on the German
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia in 2005.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The community has created its own language, and that is certainly a
</I>&gt;<i> barrier to new participants,&quot; he says.
</I>&gt;<i> One of Mr. Schulenburg's first projects, called the &quot;bookshelf,&quot; is an
</I>&gt;<i> effort to gather the basic rules for contributing to Wikipedia in one place
</I>&gt;<i> for newcomers. He hopes the new multimedia bookshelf will be the Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> community's equivalent of a high-school civics textbook.
</I>&gt;<i> In Germany, to recruit more academics, Mr. Schulenburg had devised an
</I>&gt;<i> educational program called Wikipedia Academy. In July, he conducted the
</I>&gt;<i> first such program in the U.S., for scientists and administrators at the
</I>&gt;<i> National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. His goal was to entice the
</I>&gt;<i> scientists to contribute.
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia already attracts lots of academics, but science isn't its
</I>&gt;<i> strength. By its own internal grading standards, the article on Louis
</I>&gt;<i> Pasteur, one of the founders of microbiology, for example, is lower in
</I>&gt;<i> quality than its article on James T. Kirk, the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> captain.
</I>&gt;<i> For the July event, Mr. Schulenburg got about 100 scientists and NIH
</I>&gt;<i> staffers to spend the day listening to arguments about why they should
</I>&gt;<i> bother contributing to Wikipedia, despite the fact that it doesn't pay,
</I>&gt;<i> won't help them get a grant or even win them applause from their peers.
</I>&gt;<i> His audience was skeptical about the lack of credentials among Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> editors. &quot;One of my concerns is not knowing who the editor is,&quot; said Lakshmi
</I>&gt;<i> Grama, a communications official from the National Cancer Institute.
</I>&gt;<i> Journal Community
</I>&gt;<i> Vote: How would you grade the quality of the content on Wikipedia?
</I>&gt;<i> Several participants started contributing to Wikipedia right after the
</I>&gt;<i> event. The NIH says it is considering whether to adopt formal policies to
</I>&gt;<i> encourage its staff to contribute while at work.
</I>&gt;<i> Each year, Wikipedians from around the world gather at a conference they
</I>&gt;<i> call Wikimania. At this year's meeting in Buenos Aires in August,
</I>&gt;<i> participants at one session debated the implications of the demographic
</I>&gt;<i> shifts.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The number one headline I have been seeing for five years is that
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia is dying,&quot; said Mathias Schindler, a board member of Wikimedia
</I>&gt;<i> Germany. He argued that Wikipedia needed to focus less on the total number
</I>&gt;<i> of articles and more on &quot;smarter metrics&quot; such as article quality.
</I>&gt;<i> He said he disagreed with dire views about the project's future. &quot;I don't
</I>&gt;<i> expect to see Wikipedia follow the rule of any curve or any projection.&quot;
