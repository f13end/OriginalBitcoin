</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and has been highly innovative, where would the U.S. be without Toyotism?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You misunderstood.  The Japanese innovate, indeed they spend quite a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of money on it.  However, almost any way you tally up the
</I>&gt;<i> innovations and technological advancements they produce for the amount
</I>&gt;<i> of money they spend, the *return* on the amount of R&amp;D capital at
</I>&gt;<i> their disposal is not particularly high as such things go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> R&amp;D is hopefully about maximizing useful output for the money spent in
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate, not R&amp;D theater. Productivity of R&amp;D varies widely by
</I>&gt;<i> country and source. China spends less on R&amp;D than Japan, but an
</I>&gt;<i> argument can be made that it is rapidly becoming more productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know, for years, VC's want to go green, but are hampered by mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concentrated financial capital, which supports forces that go against the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emergence of green capitalism
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eh? There is far too much capital chasing green tech in VC-land. They
</I>&gt;<i> are hampered only by the lack of green tech worth investing in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

There are very clear statements by VC's that they need massive government
investment to make the transition viable.




&gt;<i> While it is true that Web 2.0 is not capital intensive, very little of
</I>&gt;<i> Web 2.0 is &quot;innovative&quot; by the usual definition of the word.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Well let's just say that for millions of people, their lives have radically
changed, and that's a good definition of innovation for me. Before that, the
participatory elements of the web were only available to a much smaller
elite of internet users. What I see is a world of constant improvements
coming from many different quarters, aided by the 'open source' characters
of the process.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point, obviously missed, is that in reality funding does not work
</I>&gt;<i> the way you think it works. You are assuming that some sources of
</I>&gt;<i> funding are less important to innovation than they actually are. Some
</I>&gt;<i> types of funding are far more political and prone to fashion than
</I>&gt;<i> others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, you missed an important source of funding for extremely
</I>&gt;<i> technical startup ventures that is useful: large companies. You can
</I>&gt;<i> get paid to simply finish R&amp;D on a product they can buy from you
</I>&gt;<i> retail if it solves a problem they care about. (It makes economic
</I>&gt;<i> sense for the large companies if that problem is costing them many
</I>&gt;<i> millions or they can improve profits by several millions if that
</I>&gt;<i> problem is solved. The may take no stake in the venture at all, they
</I>&gt;<i> just want to be able to buy the product of it as soon as possible.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it is too early to say, and I've read research by for example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lakhami that says otherwise, pointing out one study for example showing
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most innovations come from the outside, and that experiments such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Innocentive, and the recent Netflix experiment, were quite successfull
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you are over-generalizing a narrow case. Yes, most innovations
</I>&gt;<i> come from the &quot;outside&quot;, but that outside is &quot;inside&quot; somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The point though, is that the hard distinctions between inside and outside,
between corporate and distributed, innovation are eroding, not hardening.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of that costs money.  R&amp;D on theoretical computer science seems to
</I>&gt;<i> take several months to a year to produce a successful result. A lot of
</I>&gt;<i> R&amp;D topics in software are related to massive parallelism and
</I>&gt;<i> distribution -- testbeds at that scale don't grow on trees. Turning
</I>&gt;<i> that research into a useful piece of software or code a mere mortal
</I>&gt;<i> can use often requires many man-years of very boring code work that
</I>&gt;<i> you have to pay smart people to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
that would be the case for some innovation, the important think is that we
live in a plural world, needing different ways to  fund different types of
innovation. Perhaps such types as you describe are already well-funded,
other types of innovation that produce very useful social results, are
underfunded, for example pharma research being directed to diseases
affecting a minority of the rich world population, as compared to diseases
massively affecting the masses in developing countries. It is these failures
we need to address.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Take movies, according to your logic, only big star, moderately
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but very expensive movies would make it and be necessary and count as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; innovation, as opposed to the many fine movies that have been produced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worldwide, often through public funding. Do we really want a world with
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Transformers, and without Fellini and the French New Wave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, &quot;my logic&quot;?  What does that even mean? You are assuming things
</I>&gt;<i> I never said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You have explicated your scarcity logic in another contribution. It is those
underlying assumptions that I challenge. And much of my reactions are
probably heightened by the incredible certainty in which otherwise
controversial positions are asserted as truth, so I feel that I must
reciprocate in a similar way. One's own experience always has to be put in
the context of other people's experiences, and economics is a field of great
controversy and interests, not just hard and easy facts.
