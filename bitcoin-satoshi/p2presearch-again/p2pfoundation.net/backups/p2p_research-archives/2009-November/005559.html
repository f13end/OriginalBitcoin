Belgian strike to hit Eurostar services
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iMEK6MVXJxAVC0R0QficTcB3_wxg">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iMEK6MVXJxAVC0R0QficTcB3_wxg</A>

Channel Tunnel rail services from St Pancras will be badly affected by a
24-hour strike by Belgian workers.

The stoppage will mean that the last London to Brussels train on Wednesday
will be the 6.34pm, with the 7.34pm service terminating at Lille in northern
France.

On Thursday there will be no London-Brussels services except the 7.30pm
train which will run through to the Belgian capital via Lille on the
assumption that the strike ends as planned at 9pm UK time.

Eurostar said the availability of tickets on the 7.30pm service is
&quot;extremely limited&quot;.

The company added that its services between London and Paris would be
operating normally with some trains making additional stops at Lille.

Services between London/Ashford and Disneyland Resort Paris will also
operate normally.

Another British version. :)

Eurostar services to Belgium affected by strike action
<A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/6493249/Eurostar-services-to-Belgium-affected-by-strike-action.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/6493249/Eurostar-services-to-Belgium-affected-by-strike-action.html</A>

Eurostar has announced the cancellation of all services between Britain and
Brussels on Thursday due to industrial action by Belgian rail workers.

All signallers and station staff will walk out on Wednesday night in
opposition to the restructuring plans being made within the freight division
of the Belgian national railway operator, the SNCB.

The strikes will begin at 9pm on Wednesday, continuing until 9pm on
Thursday. Nine Eurostar services to and from Brussels Midi have been
cancelled, along with all other domestic and international services in and
out of Belgium, including hi-speed TGV, ICE and THALYS trains to France,
Germany and the Netherlands.

A Eurostar spokeswoman advised travellers to make alternative arrangements
and confirmed that any passengers affected by the strikes would be allowed
to exchange their tickets for an alternative date or receive a full refund.

&#8220;Unfortunately the problem has not been resolved and we are now focused on
ensuring all passengers understand the situation,&#8221; said the spokeswoman.
&#8220;Although the last strike in Belgium was over a year ago, when industrial
action does takes place it tends to be nationwide.&#8221;

She added that major roads in the country could suffer from heavy traffic.

Last month cleaners on Eurostar trains threatened to strike over the use of
fingerprints to clock in staff, although the dispute has since been
resolved.

The company recently announced a rise in sales between July and September of
6.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2008.
