<PRE>Great article.  Really insightful.  One of the best analyses I have seen.
Madeleine Bunting must be quite the thinker.

</I>&gt;<i> Progressive politics will take root from the rubble of a Labour

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Madeleine Bunting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sunday 31 May 2009 20.30 BST
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something remarkable has happened. Politics has become entirely
</I>&gt;<i> unpredictable. Suddenly all manner of political reform is back on the
</I>&gt;<i> table, a new urgency has been infused into tired debates about
</I>&gt;<i> political disengagement and apathy, and radical reforms are being
</I>&gt;<i> proposed to reinvigorate the hollowing out of political institutions.
</I>&gt;<i> While the detail is vague, the scale is sweeping: Cameron talks about
</I>&gt;<i> a massive redistribution of power; a cabinet minister urges a
</I>&gt;<i> referendum on electoral reform; even an architect of Blair's third
</I>&gt;<i> way, Anthony Giddens, calls for a political revolution, and talked
</I>&gt;<i> last week of needing new utopias to inspire a new politics of climate
</I>&gt;<i> change. In a recent article, Martin Jacques comments on how New
</I>&gt;<i> Labour, which built its fortunes on &quot;there being no alternative&quot;, is
</I>&gt;<i> now being forced into the humiliating circumstances of having to find
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This last task is a tall order, but given the febrile nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> times, let's sketch out how that might develop, and offer Giddens a
</I>&gt;<i> first draft of what a 21st-century utopian politics might look like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first step will be defeat. The only uncertainty about the
</I>&gt;<i> European elections this week is whether people are so angry that they
</I>&gt;<i> don't bother to vote or so angry that they cast a protest vote. The
</I>&gt;<i> most useful vote this week would be for the Greens - a protest vote
</I>&gt;<i> that will help push the environment up the agenda. But this week is a
</I>&gt;<i> mere sideshow compared with what Labour will receive at the general
</I>&gt;<i> election next year - and for its brand of politics to be thoroughly
</I>&gt;<i> discredited, it needs a drubbing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from a few diehards, it will be hard to mourn the defeat in
</I>&gt;<i> 2010 of a political party that lost its moral bearings in its bid to
</I>&gt;<i> woo middle England, slavishly reflecting back what it believed this
</I>&gt;<i> narrow constituency wanted to hear. It won ballots by flattering and
</I>&gt;<i> indulging a mythology of the good life as individualistic aspiration
</I>&gt;<i> and material enrichment, and never challenged the multiple erroneous
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions on which this was based. On the two vital progressive
</I>&gt;<i> issues of its age - inequality and the environment - it wasted a
</I>&gt;<i> crucial decade and squandered parliamentary majorities on
</I>&gt;<i> contradictory and inadequate gestures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What it palpably failed to grasp was how crucial political reform was
</I>&gt;<i> to regenerate progressive politics. A party that had been
</I>&gt;<i> professionalised and managerialised in the 80s, not surprisingly, did
</I>&gt;<i> not understand how to respond to people's appetite to participate,
</I>&gt;<i> and author their own lives. It only knew how to manipulate and manage
</I>&gt;<i> public engagement, and earned deep resentment for doing both. Only
</I>&gt;<i> out of the rubble of defeat in 2010 will a new progressive politics
</I>&gt;<i> begin painfully to emerge well beyond the bankrupted conventions of
</I>&gt;<i> Westminster politics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to catch a glimpse of the kinds of places outside the
</I>&gt;<i> political mainstream where that new politics might be incubated, take
</I>&gt;<i> a look at the Transition movement. Ed Miliband, the energy and
</I>&gt;<i> climate change secretary, was one of the first to spot its potential
</I>&gt;<i> when he described this young and fast-growing movement as &quot;absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> essential&quot;. Other politicians have been similarly intrigued, and last
</I>&gt;<i> year The Transition Handbook came fifth in MPs' list of summer
</I>&gt;<i> reading. It isn't hard to see why politicians are so interested. The
</I>&gt;<i> Transition movement is engaging people in a way that conventional
</I>&gt;<i> politics is failing to do. It generates emotions that have not been
</I>&gt;<i> seen in political life for a long time: enthusiasm, idealism and
</I>&gt;<i> passionate commitment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Within three years it has gone from an idea to having 170 towns,
</I>&gt;<i> villages and cities signed up as transition communities, working in
</I>&gt;<i> 30 countries, and thousands more all over the world using the
</I>&gt;<i> transition model. It is viral, catching on faster than its founder,
</I>&gt;<i> Rob Hopkins, can track. Its message is that peak oil and climate
</I>&gt;<i> change demand dramatic changes in the way people live, and, given
</I>&gt;<i> that no one has the answer, communities themselves must start working
</I>&gt;<i> out how that change might come about. It offers no answers, no
</I>&gt;<i> solutions, only some tips in a handbook for how to get started.
</I>&gt;<i> Transition lays the challenge squarely at the door of everyone. This
</I>&gt;<i> is too big and difficult for government alone to tackle, too
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelming and depressing for individuals to face alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transition is rooted in a new politics of place: geography matters
</I>&gt;<i> again as people look to the community immediately around them to
</I>&gt;<i> devise the solutions for sustainability and resilience. At one level
</I>&gt;<i> it works as a way of regenerating social capital, building up
</I>&gt;<i> relationships with neighbours, working out how to collaborate again
</I>&gt;<i> on common interests - community gardens, recycling, waste and
</I>&gt;<i> strengthening the local economy. At another level it is about
</I>&gt;<i> educating people about the challenges of peak oil and climate change,
</I>&gt;<i> but the mobilisation and consciousness-raising is directed towards
</I>&gt;<i> optimism and hope, not despair: how can this community use its skills
</I>&gt;<i> and imagination to build its future?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result is a proliferation of experiments, all of which are
</I>&gt;<i> charted on their wiki websites: the collaboration is both local and
</I>&gt;<i> global. Communities in Somerset can swap ideas and get inspiration
</I>&gt;<i> from Brazil, Australia or the US. It's a world away from the smooth
</I>&gt;<i> presentation of party politics, and transitioners are quick to point
</I>&gt;<i> to the disclaimer on their site - they have no idea if the movement
</I>&gt;<i> will work. They're organising local food festivals now, but tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> it could be community renewable energy. The emphasis is always on
</I>&gt;<i> conviviality and enjoyment; on learning skills that have been lost
</I>&gt;<i> over the last few decades - how to cook, grow food, repair and make
</I>&gt;<i> things. Scotland has funded several transition organisers to work
</I>&gt;<i> across the country. This is an unusual thing: local grassroots
</I>&gt;<i> environmentalism that is full of hope for the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Their meetings don't have agendas or presentations - Miliband came to
</I>&gt;<i> their annual conference recently as a keynote listener. They use
</I>&gt;<i> what's called open space technology, in which everyone brings their
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and everyone participates. Humble, self-organising, the
</I>&gt;<i> movement owes much to the idealistic thinking of the early 70s. This
</I>&gt;<i> is a time for revisiting those alternatives, which have been so
</I>&gt;<i> contemptuously dismissed for a quarter of a century.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of its growing success is how it meets several needs
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously. It tackles social recession - the sense of
</I>&gt;<i> disconnection and fragmentation of community - at the same time as it
</I>&gt;<i> collaborates on the huge behavioural change that will be required for
</I>&gt;<i> a low-carbon society. The latter is far more likely to come about in
</I>&gt;<i> the context of personal relationships than as a result of discredited
</I>&gt;<i> politicians dictating change. It is fulfilling an unexpected appetite
</I>&gt;<i> for political engagement at a time of widespread disillusionment with
</I>&gt;<i> the conventional political processes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopkins is emphatic that transition groups refuse all political
</I>&gt;<i> affiliation; they must build alliances to work across all parts of
</I>&gt;<i> their community. But it is intriguing to see how the movement is
</I>&gt;<i> experimenting with the sorts of ideas those in conventional politics
</I>&gt;<i> are talking about - localism, decentralisation of power to
</I>&gt;<i> communities, an environmental politics that is utopian and hopeful
</I>&gt;<i> rather than gloomy. Of course detractors can point out its wholemeal
</I>&gt;<i> worthiness, but it is stubbornly swimming against the tide of
</I>&gt;<i> pervasive political pessimism, and given the unpredictability of the
</I>&gt;<i> times, who knows where it will end up?
