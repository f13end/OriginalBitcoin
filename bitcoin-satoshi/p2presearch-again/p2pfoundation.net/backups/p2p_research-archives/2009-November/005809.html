<PRE>On 11/8/09, Paul D. Fernhout &lt;<A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">pdfernhout at kurtz-fernhout.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i>  There's another way the analogy fails. A country is not a house. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  More seriously, in a country one has lots of places to go where the state
</I>&gt;<i> (in a democracy, in theory) is mostly not supposed to intrude, like your own
</I>&gt;<i> house. So, it's like a house where you have your own private room the owner
</I>&gt;<i> agrees not to usually come into.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Also, in a country, in theory, citizens help define the laws. So, it's like
</I>&gt;<i> a house with a rules committee, not a single dictator/owner.
</I>
But the social contract theory still assumes some entity with
jurisdiction over a geographical area with authority analogous to that
of a homeowner, to set conditions regarding what you must do to be
allowed to stay.  And there's a burden of proof to demonstrate the
origins of that authority.   Simply claiming it and then taking
continued residence as ipso facto consent isn't enough.  If I come
into your house and say &quot;your decision to stay here amounts to
consenting to abide by my rules,&quot; the proper response is &quot;who gave you
the right issue such ultimatums?&quot;  That a contiguous geographical area
constitutes a body politic, with some entity having authority to set
rules for the entire area, is something to be proved, and your
argument takes it as a given.  I don't believe such an authority could
ever come about in the first place, without the free, explicit, and
unanimous consent of every single individual in society.

&gt;<i>  But with all that said, can state power in some areas of life be too strong
</I>&gt;<i> to be healthy? Sure. It's that Manuel de Landa meshwork hierarchy balance
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/meshwork.htm">http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/meshwork.htm</A>
</I>
Again, though, it gets back to the question of whether the state even
has any business judging what is a &quot;healthy&quot; balance of political
power exercised in my house, and whether the state has the right to
issue commands and take my continued residence as &quot;consent.&quot;


&gt;<i>  There are other forms of libertarianism though. Noam Chomsky identifies
</I>&gt;<i> himself as a libertarian socialist.
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Libertarian socialism (sometimes called socialist anarchism,[1][2] and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes left libertarianism[3][4]) is a group of political philosophies
</I>&gt;<i> that aspire to create a society without political, economic, or social
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies, i.e. a society in which all violent or coercive institutions
</I>&gt;<i> would be dissolved, and in their place every person would have free, equal
</I>&gt;<i> access to the tools of information and production.[5]&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i>  But, based on Manuel de Landa, that's seems like a theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> impossibility. A shared culture is itself a sort of hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> institution, as is a constitution, as is shared standards, and so on. Even
</I>&gt;<i> informal agreements about the commons are a sort of hierarchical thing in
</I>&gt;<i> some sense. Socially it may not feel like a hierarchy; Manuel de Landa is
</I>&gt;<i> talking more conceptually.
</I>
But the existence of some legal standard for distinguishing aggression
from self-defense is not the same as the existence of an entity with
the authority to initiate force on behalf of the &quot;public good&quot; or
&quot;general  welfare.&quot;

And while libertarian socialists of the anarcho-communist,
-syndicalist, etc., varieties posit different sets of legal rules for
identifying the rightful owner of a given parcel of land or workplace,
the framework is only adopted from the necessity of having some common
legal standard for distinguishing legitimate self-defense from
aggression.  They don't vest any agency with a police power (i.e., the
power to initiate force on behalf of the community).
