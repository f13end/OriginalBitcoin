</I>&gt;<i> Reason is not self-legitimating. Like all Enlightenment advocates for
</I>&gt;<i> reason, transhumanists find that the project of Reason erodes all premises
</I>&gt;<i> including the superiority of reason over unreason. Consequently
</I>&gt;<i> transhumanists, like Enlightenment advocates in general, need to defend our
</I>&gt;<i> values with *nonrational* a prioris. Unfortunately some transhumanists
</I>&gt;<i> continue to advocate a na&#239;ve conception of pure rationality as an end in
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Enlightenment and Reason
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reason was the central value of the Enlightenment. Some historians see the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of the Enlightenment in the early seventeenth century &#8220;Age of
</I>&gt;<i> Reason,&#8221; associated with the Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hobbes, Locke, and
</I>&gt;<i> Berkeley. Historian Dorinda Outram defined the central claims of the
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment around its appeal to reason:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality
</I>&gt;<i> rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of
</I>&gt;<i> human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the
</I>&gt;<i> restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition.
</I>&gt;<i> (Outram, 1995: 3)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When Kant wrote his essay (1784a) &#8220;Was ist Aufkl&#228;rung&#8221; or &#8220;What is
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment?&#8221; for the Berlinische Monatschrift, he summed up the slogan of
</I>&gt;<i> the Enlightenment as &#8220;sapere aude&#8221; or &#8220;dare to know.&#8221;  Though divided by
</I>&gt;<i> epistemology and theology, these thinkers attempted to ground philosophy on
</I>&gt;<i> uncontestable propositions such as &#8220;cogito ergo sum.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This thorough-going undermining of all irrational a prioris led to a number
</I>&gt;<i> of philosophical dead-ends, however, immediately generating a score of
</I>&gt;<i> post-rationalist movements. In the midst of the Enlightenment, Jean-Jacques
</I>&gt;<i> Rousseau valorized the primitive and decried the harmful effects of
</I>&gt;<i> hyper-rationalism on morality (Glendon, 1999). After all, as Hume
</I>&gt;<i> underlined, the Enlightenment had severed any connection between the IS and
</I>&gt;<i> the OUGHT. Although Kant and the utilitarians would attempt to re-ground
</I>&gt;<i> ethics on what appeared to be empirical observations about human nature,
</I>&gt;<i> they could never answer the next question: why should ethics be grounded on
</I>&gt;<i> observations about human nature and not something else, like ancient
</I>&gt;<i> religious dogmas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eighteenth century Romanticism was also a reaction to the overreach of
</I>&gt;<i> reason in its assertion of the value of aesthetic and emotional experience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From the eighteenth century through World War Two, movements on both the
</I>&gt;<i> right and left turned against Enlightenment rationalism. On the Left, the
</I>&gt;<i> Frankfurt School writers criticized the Enlightenment&#8217;s instrumental
</I>&gt;<i> rationality for its complicity in authoritarianism (Adorno and Horkheimer,
</I>&gt;<i> 2006; Marcuse, 1964; Saul, 1992; Gray, 1995). Various strains of feminism
</I>&gt;<i> and anti-imperialism attacked the patriarchal and Eurocentric construction
</I>&gt;<i> of Enlightenment reason (Harding, 1982). These post-rationalist movements
</I>&gt;<i> rejected the autonomy and universality of reason because it came into
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with other values of the Enlightenment, such as respect for the
</I>&gt;<i> rights of persons and for cultural diversity. Meanwhile, theologians and
</I>&gt;<i> philosophers of the Right blamed communism on the totalizing logic of the
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment&#8217;s assertion of utopian reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the 20th century, Enlightenment rationalism also began to question its
</I>&gt;<i> own first principles. One example is found in Wittgenstein&#8217;s turn from
</I>&gt;<i> logical positivism. The logical positivists attempted to ban from
</I>&gt;<i> philosophical discourse all terms and concepts without empirical referents.
</I>&gt;<i> Ludwig Wittgenstein, although an early and influential advocate of this
</I>&gt;<i> position, eventually changed his mind as he further investigated how
</I>&gt;<i> language actually worked. Having turned empirical investigation on the
</I>&gt;<i> process of reasoning itself, and attempting to purify language of all
</I>&gt;<i> irrationality, Wittgenstein concluded that the goal was chimerical
</I>&gt;<i> (Wittgenstein, 1953). Language is a series of word games in which meanings
</I>&gt;<i> are created only in reference to other words and not to empirical facts. The
</I>&gt;<i> positivist project of building a rational philosophy from uncontestable
</I>&gt;<i> empirical observations is impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Foucault, Derrida, and the postmodernists also represent an implosion of
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment reason.  Although I believe postmodernist &#8220;criticism&#8221; to be
</I>&gt;<i> mostly a dead end, the essential insight is true: all claims for
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment reason are historically situated and biased by power and
</I>&gt;<i> position. The Enlightenment is just one historical narrative among many and
</I>&gt;<i> there is no rational reason to choose the Enlightenment narrative over any
</I>&gt;<i> other. Reason can only be argued for from metaphysical and ethical a
</I>&gt;<i> prioris, even if those are only such basic assumptions as &#8216;it is good to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to accomplish one&#8217;s intended goals.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most tangibly, contemporary neuroscience, also a product of Enlightenment
</I>&gt;<i> reason, now recognizes that reason severed from emotion is impotent. In
</I>&gt;<i> Damasio&#8217;s (1994) now classic studies of patients with brain damage that
</I>&gt;<i> severed the ties between emotion and decision-making, the victims were
</I>&gt;<i> incapable of making decisions. The desire to stop deliberating and make a
</I>&gt;<i> decision is not itself rational &#8211; it is a product of temperament. Reason was
</I>&gt;<i> built to serve, but is incapable of generating its own commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transhumanists and Reason
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most transhumanists argue the Enlightenment case for Reason without
</I>&gt;<i> ackowledging its self-undermining nature. For instance Max More&#8217;s Extropian
</I>&gt;<i> Principles codified &#8220;rational thinking&#8221; as one of its seven precepts (More,
</I>&gt;<i> 1998):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like humanists, transhumanists favor reason, progress, and values centered
</I>&gt;<i> on our well being rather than on an external religious authority. (More,
</I>&gt;<i> 1998)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Transhumanist FAQ defines transhumanism as the consistent application
</I>&gt;<i> of reason:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and
</I>&gt;<i> desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied
</I>&gt;<i> reason&#8230;We might not be perfect, but we can make things better by promoting
</I>&gt;<i> rational thinking, freedom, tolerance, democracy, and concern for our fellow
</I>&gt;<i> human beings&#8230; Just as we use rational means to improve the human condition
</I>&gt;<i> and the external world, we can also use such means to improve ourselves, the
</I>&gt;<i> human organism. (Humanity+, 2003)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the central transhumanist blogs is Less Wrong, based at Oxford
</I>&gt;<i> University under the aegis of transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom and
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated to &#8220;the art of refining human rationality.&#8221; A frequent
</I>&gt;<i> contributor there is Eliezer Yudkowsky, an auto-didact writer on artificial
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence and human cognitive biases who also is a co-founder of the
</I>&gt;<i> Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Yudkowsky has said that
</I>&gt;<i> one of his goals is to lead a &#8220;mass movement to train people to be
</I>&gt;<i> black-belt rationalists.&#8221; The Less Wrong blog highlights Yudkowsky&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> definitions of rationality &lt;<A HREF="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/”">http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/%E2%80%9D</A>&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> their importance as its raison d&#8217;etre:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What Do We Mean By &#8220;Rationality&#8221;?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We mean:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Epistemic rationality: believing, and updating on evidence, so as to
</I>&gt;<i> systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the
</I>&gt;<i> territory. The art of obtaining beliefs that correspond to reality as
</I>&gt;<i> closely as possible. This correspondence is commonly termed &#8220;truth&#8221; or
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;accuracy&#8221;, and we&#8217;re happy to call it that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Instrumental rationality: achieving your values. Not necessarily &#8220;your
</I>&gt;<i> values&#8221; in the sense of being selfish values or unshared values: &#8220;your
</I>&gt;<i> values&#8221; means anything you care about. The art of choosing actions that
</I>&gt;<i> steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. On LW we
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes refer to this as &#8220;winning.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But why should we want a map that corresponds to the territory? Where do
</I>&gt;<i> the values that rationality help us achieve come from? What if the valuation
</I>&gt;<i> of instrumental rationality in fact is an obstacle to achieving the things
</I>&gt;<i> we value, as the romantics claim, such as beauty, meaning, contentment, and
</I>&gt;<i> awe? Yudkowsky goes so far as to acknowledge the problem in order to define
</I>&gt;<i> it as something that is simply not to be discussed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230; many of us will regard as controversial&#8212;at the very least&#8212;any construal
</I>&gt;<i> of &#8220;rationality&#8221; that makes it non-normative. For example, if you say, &#8220;The
</I>&gt;<i> rational belief is X, but the true belief is Y&#8221; then you are probably using
</I>&gt;<i> the word &#8220;rational&#8221; in a way that means something other than what most of us
</I>&gt;<i> have in mind&#8230;  Similarly, if you find yourself saying, &#8220;The rational thing
</I>&gt;<i> to do is X, but the right thing to do is Y&#8221; then you are almost certainly
</I>&gt;<i> using one of the words &#8220;rational&#8221; or &#8220;right&#8221; in a way that a huge chunk of
</I>&gt;<i> readers won&#8217;t agree with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately for Yudkowsky, he has been ceded authority by his readers to
</I>&gt;<i> write off all philosophical debate about the relationship of IS and OUGHT.
</I>&gt;<i> But this will leave his transhumanist rationality experts defenseless
</I>&gt;<i> debating those with different metaphysics, or when they face their own dark
</I>&gt;<i> nights of the soul.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the central philosophical debates between bioconservatives and
</I>&gt;<i> transhumanists, and &#8220;bioliberals&#8221; more generally, over the last two decades
</I>&gt;<i> has been over the legitimacy of emotivist arguments such as Leon Kass&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> (1997) &#8220;wisdom of repugnance&#8221; (Roache and Clarke, 2009). In 2003, the
</I>&gt;<i> bioconservative Yuval Levin wrote in &#8220;The Paradox of Conservative Bioethics&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> of the tragic dilemma faced by conservatives trying to devise rational
</I>&gt;<i> arguments in defense of irrational taboos. Once liberal democracy forces the
</I>&gt;<i> conservative to abandon appeals to tradition or intuition, democratic debate
</I>&gt;<i> naturalizes the new.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very fact that everything must be laid out in the open in the
</I>&gt;<i> democratic age is destructive of the reverence that gives moral intuition
</I>&gt;<i> its authority. A deep moral taboo cannot simply become another option among
</I>&gt;<i> others, which argues its case in the market place. Entering the market and
</I>&gt;<i> laying out its wares takes away from its venerated stature, and its stature
</I>&gt;<i> is the key to its authority. By the very fact that it becomes open to
</I>&gt;<i> dispute&#8212;its pros and cons tallied up and counted&#8212;the taboo slowly ceases to
</I>&gt;<i> exist&#8230; A conservative bioethics&#8230;is forced to proceed by pulling up its own
</I>&gt;<i> roots, and to begin by violating some of the very principles it seeks to
</I>&gt;<i> defend. (Levin, 2003)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transhumanists and the Enlightenment face the opposite dilemma: how to
</I>&gt;<i> advocate for rationality in a way that avoids its potential for
</I>&gt;<i> self-erosion. Just as the bioconservatives cannot validate their taboos and
</I>&gt;<i> ethical a prioris in the public square, there is likewise no *rational*reason why society should reject taboos and superstition in favor of a
</I>&gt;<i> transhuman future; value judgments in favor of tradition, faith, and taboo,
</I>&gt;<i> or in favor of progress, reason, and liberty both stem from pre-rational
</I>&gt;<i> premises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transhumanists need to acknowledge their own historical situatedness and
</I>&gt;<i> defend their normative and epistemological first principles as existential
</I>&gt;<i> choices instead of empirical absolutes somehow derived from reason.  One
</I>&gt;<i> example of a transhumanist acknowledging the pre-rational roots of
</I>&gt;<i> transhumanist values is anti-aging activist and IEET Fellow Aubrey de Grey&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> 2008 essay &#8220;Reasons and methods for promoting our duty to extend healthy
</I>&gt;<i> life indefinitely.&#8221; De Grey directly addresses Leon Kass&#8217; emotivist argument
</I>&gt;<i> and turns it on its head. What, de Grey asks, is more repugnant than
</I>&gt;<i> sickness, aging, and death? Those arguing the anti-aging cause, de Grey
</I>&gt;<i> concludes, should start from these shared intuitions and prejudices instead
</I>&gt;<i> of starting from reasoned arguments that presume the &#8220;objectivity of
</I>&gt;<i> morality&#8221; and the &#8220;unreliability of gut feelings.&#8221; When I first heard de
</I>&gt;<i> Grey&#8217;s argument, I demurred, thinking he had given away too much to the
</I>&gt;<i> emotivists. But that was simply my own fear of letting go of my superior
</I>&gt;<i> rational ethical viewpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I imagine the project of Reason, I think of building a house in
</I>&gt;<i> mid-air. I look over at the other houses floating in mid-air, the
</I>&gt;<i> pre-Enlightenment houses, and they are ramshackle huts of mud daub and
</I>&gt;<i> random flotsam, tied up with string. To get from one room to another in our
</I>&gt;<i> neighbors&#8217; houses, you have to crawl to the basement and then up a laundry
</I>&gt;<i> chute. They sit in darkened rooms with few windows, and none that show that
</I>&gt;<i> the house is not in fact rooted to the earth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the pure, lean precision of Reason we have built our houses of
</I>&gt;<i> Kantianism, utilitarianism, liberal democracy, and other clean architectural
</I>&gt;<i> marvels, Frank Lloyd Wright structures of thought with lots of windows, and
</I>&gt;<i> even glass floors. But most of us steadfastly ignore the fact that, just
</I>&gt;<i> like our neighbors, we are floating in mid-air. Acknowledging that we are
</I>&gt;<i> all in mid-air and don&#8217;t know how we got aloft in the first place is damned
</I>&gt;<i> scary, and we have repeatedly seen people defect from our Enlightenment
</I>&gt;<i> houses with glass floors to our neighbors&#8217; houses of faith and dogma where
</I>&gt;<i> they are not forced to look down. We need to learn the courage to
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge that we got this thing in the air through an act of will&#8212;that
</I>&gt;<i> Reason is a good tool but that our values and moral codes are not grounded
</I>&gt;<i> in Reason&#8212;or else we will lose many more people to the forces of
</I>&gt;<i> irrationality in the future.
