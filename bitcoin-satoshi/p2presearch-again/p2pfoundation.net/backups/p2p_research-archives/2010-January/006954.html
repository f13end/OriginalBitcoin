<PRE>Thanks Dale,

I guess I was pleased to see someone in the TH movement at least
acknowledging that they have a problem ... at least hughes is a
social-democrat ...

I know you see no potential in them, and neither do I, as a movement, but, I
have no choice than to compose with th individuals on specific p2p projects,
as there is definitely a wing of people who are both active in floss/open
manufacturing, and sympathetic if not enthusiastic to technological promise
of the TH variety,

Michel

&gt;<i> At the risk of seeming pedantic and cranky, what exactly is &quot;excellent&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> about this piece?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's more commonplace than claiming your pet marginal movement speaks
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;Reason&quot;? Ayn Rand's dumb-dumb legions are forever declaring that they
</I>&gt;<i> are champions of &quot;enlightenment&quot; against &quot;irrationalists&quot; in *precisely*
</I>&gt;<i> this same way.  The correspondence is not accidental.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are lots of laundry lists of philosophers and critics in Hughes'
</I>&gt;<i> piece, but none of them are actually cited nor their arguments even
</I>&gt;<i> paraphrased for the most part, and many are treated as though they
</I>&gt;<i> advocated planks in some shared &quot;Official Enlightenment Program.&quot;  As
</I>&gt;<i> someone who has read Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Kant I find it rather
</I>&gt;<i> flabbergasting to find them thrown in the same drawer as Hughes does. I
</I>&gt;<i> see no signs that Hughes has actually read any of these figures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why even mention Wittgenstein or Adorno at all if you are going to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> them to the sort of thing one can find on the panel of a cereal box?
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, &quot;postmodernism,&quot; we are told is an &quot;an implosion of
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightenment,&quot; which is a metaphor corresponding to what exactly? Why is
</I>&gt;<i> Spinoza assigned a place of pride in the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; column while
</I>&gt;<i> Foucault is described instead as a presumably &quot;anti-reason&quot; postmodernist
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dead-ender&quot;? You know, Foucault wasn't exactly ignorant of Kant's &quot;What
</I>&gt;<i> Is Enlightenment&quot; (Foucault wrote about Kant's essay *famously*) nor was
</I>&gt;<i> his criticism (a word which Hughes scare-quotes when he connects it to
</I>&gt;<i> postmodernists for who knows what reason, especially given that the
</I>&gt;<i> closest he ever comes to actually ascribing a critical thesis to
</I>&gt;<i> postmodernism he seems to agree with it) operating in a completely
</I>&gt;<i> different plain with Adorno. Foucault and Derrida are treated as saying
</I>&gt;<i> the same sorts of postmodern things (anyone who has read either knows this
</I>&gt;<i> is like pretending Plato and Aristotle were saying the same thing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly agree with Hughes that beloved transhumanist luminary and
</I>&gt;<i> would-be guru Eliezer Yudowsky has a laughably facile view of human
</I>&gt;<i> reason, culture, discourse, history -- but the fact remains that far more
</I>&gt;<i> transhumanist-identified people find Yudkowsky's idiotic reductionism
</I>&gt;<i> sympathetic than Hughes' views here (and to be honest, Hughes' own refusal
</I>&gt;<i> to endorse &quot;postmodern irrationalism&quot; is closely akin to Yudkowsky's own
</I>&gt;<i> know-nothingism, despite the fact that Hughes is laying out the same sort
</I>&gt;<i> of case -- even if in an awfully flat-footed and elementary variation --
</I>&gt;<i> folks excoriated as &quot;postmodernists&quot; by self-appointed champions of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Enlightenment&quot; -- exactly like Hughes -- also often make before they move
</I>&gt;<i> on to more interesting claims), just as far more trasnhumanist-identified
</I>&gt;<i> people find market libertarian political views sympathetic than Hughes's
</I>&gt;<i> own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hughes is forever trying to peddle transhumanism as something it is not. I
</I>&gt;<i> mean that both in the sociological sense of how actual people who actually
</I>&gt;<i> participate in &quot;transhumanist&quot; organizations and idenitfy publicly as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transhumanists&quot; demonstrably behave in the real world, but also in the
</I>&gt;<i> critical sense of what is logically, topically, and tropologically
</I>&gt;<i> entailed by the arguments made by and in the name of transhumanism.  The
</I>&gt;<i> result is that he provides cover for facile reductionist methodologies and
</I>&gt;<i> reactionary politics even while making qualified cases for their
</I>&gt;<i> contraries himself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this piece, to be completely honest, Hughes looks to me to be
</I>&gt;<i> pretending to knowledges he shows no real sign of knowing or even really
</I>&gt;<i> caring about on their own terms, and all in the service of a deceptive
</I>&gt;<i> project to peddle his &quot;transhumanist&quot; movement as a more reasonable one
</I>&gt;<i> than it is so that his position within it can in turn seem more reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> than it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But all of that is a distraction in my view.  The gesture of the
</I>&gt;<i> futurological more generally is of a piece with [1]
</I>&gt;<i> promotional/advertizing hyperbole on which consumer culture depends to
</I>&gt;<i> distract potential peers from the fact that we have arrived at a
</I>&gt;<i> technoscientific level which could provide for sustainable and equitable
</I>&gt;<i> prosperity the better to preserve in place the hierarchies of authority
</I>&gt;<i> and property of incumbent interests [2] the promissory discourses of
</I>&gt;<i> neoliberal financiancialization (promises mistaken for assets) and
</I>&gt;<i> industrialization (development as progress as freedom) [3] the emergency
</I>&gt;<i> discourses of neoconservative insecurity (existential threats of terror,
</I>&gt;<i> WMD, pandemic, singularity as proxies for disavowed militarized
</I>&gt;<i> administration of and preparation for resource descent and climate
</I>&gt;<i> change).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, I regard futurology in its most extreme sub(cult)ural
</I>&gt;<i> formations -- as one finds in &quot;movement&quot; transhumanism, extropianism,
</I>&gt;<i> singularitarianism, cybernetic totalism, techno-immortalism and so on, the
</I>&gt;<i> formations with which Hughes is explicitly connected himself -- as a
</I>&gt;<i> constellation of profoundly dangerous faith-based fundamentalisms (it is a
</I>&gt;<i> commonplace, by the way, however paradoxical, to find adherents of
</I>&gt;<i> marginal movements declaring themselves uniquely indispensable champions
</I>&gt;<i> of Enlightenment against the forces of irrationalism).  &quot;Futurology&quot; is a
</I>&gt;<i> prevalent mindset suffusing development and policy discourse, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> the level at which it is most important to intervene in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transhumanists are an extreme and marginal variation of that more
</I>&gt;<i> prevalent neoliberal/ neoconservative developmentalism -- they are
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically photogenic and compelling in their extremity, and they also
</I>&gt;<i> reveal with special clarity the paradoxes and contradictions that are more
</I>&gt;<i> muddled in the more prevailing developmental discourses, only because,
</I>&gt;<i> again in their extremity, transhumanists push these contradictions to
</I>&gt;<i> their breaking point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is a mistake -- of which I have been guilty myself -- to take the
</I>&gt;<i> superlative futurologists more seriously than their futurological kin in
</I>&gt;<i> more mainstream technocratic and developmentalist policy and public
</I>&gt;<i> discourses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best to you, d

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Reason is not self-legitimating. Like all Enlightenment advocates for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason, transhumanists find that the project of Reason erodes all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; premises
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; including the superiority of reason over unreason. Consequently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; transhumanists, like Enlightenment advocates in general, need to defend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; values with *nonrational* a prioris. Unfortunately some transhumanists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; continue to advocate a na&#239;ve conception of pure rationality as an end in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The Enlightenment and Reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Reason was the central value of the Enlightenment. Some historians see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; beginning of the Enlightenment in the early seventeenth century &#8220;Age of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Reason,&#8221; associated with the Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hobbes, Locke,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Berkeley. Historian Dorinda Outram defined the central claims of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment around its appeal to reason:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (Outram, 1995: 3)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When Kant wrote his essay (1784a) &#8220;Was ist Aufkl&#228;rung&#8221; or &#8220;What is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment?&#8221; for the Berlinische Monatschrift, he summed up the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; slogan of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the Enlightenment as &#8220;sapere aude&#8221; or &#8220;dare to know.&#8221;  Though divided by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; epistemology and theology, these thinkers attempted to ground philosophy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; uncontestable propositions such as &#8220;cogito ergo sum.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This thorough-going undermining of all irrational a prioris led to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of philosophical dead-ends, however, immediately generating a score of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; post-rationalist movements. In the midst of the Enlightenment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Jean-Jacques
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Rousseau valorized the primitive and decried the harmful effects of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; hyper-rationalism on morality (Glendon, 1999). After all, as Hume
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; underlined, the Enlightenment had severed any connection between the IS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the OUGHT. Although Kant and the utilitarians would attempt to re-ground
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ethics on what appeared to be empirical observations about human nature,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; they could never answer the next question: why should ethics be grounded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; observations about human nature and not something else, like ancient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; religious dogmas?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Eighteenth century Romanticism was also a reaction to the overreach of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason in its assertion of the value of aesthetic and emotional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; experience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;From the eighteenth century through World War Two, movements on both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; right and left turned against Enlightenment rationalism. On the Left,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Frankfurt School writers criticized the Enlightenment&#8217;s instrumental
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rationality for its complicity in authoritarianism (Adorno and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Horkheimer,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2006; Marcuse, 1964; Saul, 1992; Gray, 1995). Various strains of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; feminism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and anti-imperialism attacked the patriarchal and Eurocentric
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; construction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of Enlightenment reason (Harding, 1982). These post-rationalist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; movements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rejected the autonomy and universality of reason because it came into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; conflict with other values of the Enlightenment, such as respect for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rights of persons and for cultural diversity. Meanwhile, theologians and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; philosophers of the Right blamed communism on the totalizing logic of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment&#8217;s assertion of utopian reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In the 20th century, Enlightenment rationalism also began to question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; own first principles. One example is found in Wittgenstein&#8217;s turn from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; logical positivism. The logical positivists attempted to ban from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; philosophical discourse all terms and concepts without empirical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; referents.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ludwig Wittgenstein, although an early and influential advocate of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; position, eventually changed his mind as he further investigated how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; language actually worked. Having turned empirical investigation on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; process of reasoning itself, and attempting to purify language of all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; irrationality, Wittgenstein concluded that the goal was chimerical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (Wittgenstein, 1953). Language is a series of word games in which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; meanings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; are created only in reference to other words and not to empirical facts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; positivist project of building a rational philosophy from uncontestable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; empirical observations is impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Foucault, Derrida, and the postmodernists also represent an implosion of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment reason.  Although I believe postmodernist &#8220;criticism&#8221; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mostly a dead end, the essential insight is true: all claims for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment reason are historically situated and biased by power and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; position. The Enlightenment is just one historical narrative among many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; there is no rational reason to choose the Enlightenment narrative over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; other. Reason can only be argued for from metaphysical and ethical a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; prioris, even if those are only such basic assumptions as &#8216;it is good to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; able to accomplish one&#8217;s intended goals.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Most tangibly, contemporary neuroscience, also a product of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Enlightenment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason, now recognizes that reason severed from emotion is impotent. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Damasio&#8217;s (1994) now classic studies of patients with brain damage that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; severed the ties between emotion and decision-making, the victims were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; incapable of making decisions. The desire to stop deliberating and make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision is not itself rational &#8211; it is a product of temperament. Reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; built to serve, but is incapable of generating its own commands.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Transhumanists and Reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Most transhumanists argue the Enlightenment case for Reason without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ackowledging its self-undermining nature. For instance Max More&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Extropian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Principles codified &#8220;rational thinking&#8221; as one of its seven precepts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (More, 1998):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Like humanists, transhumanists favor reason, progress, and values
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; centered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on our well being rather than on an external religious authority. (More,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1998)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The Transhumanist FAQ defines transhumanism as the consistent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of reason:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; applied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason&#8230;We might not be perfect, but we can make things better by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; promoting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rational thinking, freedom, tolerance, democracy, and concern for our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fellow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; human beings&#8230; Just as we use rational means to improve the human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; condition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and the external world, we can also use such means to improve ourselves,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; human organism. (Humanity+, 2003)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One of the central transhumanist blogs is Less Wrong, based at Oxford
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; University under the aegis of transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dedicated to &#8220;the art of refining human rationality.&#8221; A frequent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; contributor there is Eliezer Yudkowsky, an auto-didact writer on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; artificial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; intelligence and human cognitive biases who also is a co-founder of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Yudkowsky has said
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one of his goals is to lead a &#8220;mass movement to train people to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; black-belt rationalists.&#8221; The Less Wrong blog highlights Yudkowsky&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; definitions of rationality &lt;<A HREF="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/”">http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/%E2%80%9D</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their importance as its raison d&#8217;etre:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *What Do We Mean By &#8220;Rationality&#8221;?*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We mean:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. Epistemic rationality: believing, and updating on evidence, so as to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; territory. The art of obtaining beliefs that correspond to reality as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; closely as possible. This correspondence is commonly termed &#8220;truth&#8221; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#8220;accuracy&#8221;, and we&#8217;re happy to call it that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2. Instrumental rationality: achieving your values. Not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#8220;your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; values&#8221; in the sense of being selfish values or unshared values: &#8220;your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; values&#8221; means anything you care about. The art of choosing actions that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. On
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; LW we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sometimes refer to this as &#8220;winning.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But why should we want a map that corresponds to the territory? Where do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the values that rationality help us achieve come from? What if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; valuation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of instrumental rationality in fact is an obstacle to achieving the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we value, as the romantics claim, such as beauty, meaning, contentment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; awe? Yudkowsky goes so far as to acknowledge the problem in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it as something that is simply not to be discussed:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#8230; many of us will regard as controversial&#8212;at the very least&#8212;any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; construal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of &#8220;rationality&#8221; that makes it non-normative. For example, if you say,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#8220;The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rational belief is X, but the true belief is Y&#8221; then you are probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the word &#8220;rational&#8221; in a way that means something other than what most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have in mind&#8230;  Similarly, if you find yourself saying, &#8220;The rational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to do is X, but the right thing to do is Y&#8221; then you are almost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using one of the words &#8220;rational&#8221; or &#8220;right&#8221; in a way that a huge chunk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; readers won&#8217;t agree with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Fortunately for Yudkowsky, he has been ceded authority by his readers to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; write off all philosophical debate about the relationship of IS and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; OUGHT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But this will leave his transhumanist rationality experts defenseless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; debating those with different metaphysics, or when they face their own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dark
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; nights of the soul.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One of the central philosophical debates between bioconservatives and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; transhumanists, and &#8220;bioliberals&#8221; more generally, over the last two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decades
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; has been over the legitimacy of emotivist arguments such as Leon Kass&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (1997) &#8220;wisdom of repugnance&#8221; (Roache and Clarke, 2009). In 2003, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bioconservative Yuval Levin wrote in &#8220;The Paradox of Conservative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Bioethics&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of the tragic dilemma faced by conservatives trying to devise rational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; arguments in defense of irrational taboos. Once liberal democracy forces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; conservative to abandon appeals to tradition or intuition, democratic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; debate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; naturalizes the new.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The very fact that everything must be laid out in the open in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; democratic age is destructive of the reverence that gives moral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; intuition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; its authority. A deep moral taboo cannot simply become another option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; among
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; others, which argues its case in the market place. Entering the market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; laying out its wares takes away from its venerated stature, and its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; stature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is the key to its authority. By the very fact that it becomes open to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dispute&#8212;its pros and cons tallied up and counted&#8212;the taboo slowly ceases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; exist&#8230; A conservative bioethics&#8230;is forced to proceed by pulling up its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; roots, and to begin by violating some of the very principles it seeks to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; defend. (Levin, 2003)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Transhumanists and the Enlightenment face the opposite dilemma: how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; advocate for rationality in a way that avoids its potential for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; self-erosion. Just as the bioconservatives cannot validate their taboos
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ethical a prioris in the public square, there is likewise no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *rational*reason why society should reject taboos and superstition in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; favor of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; transhuman future; value judgments in favor of tradition, faith, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; taboo,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or in favor of progress, reason, and liberty both stem from pre-rational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; premises.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Transhumanists need to acknowledge their own historical situatedness and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; defend their normative and epistemological first principles as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; existential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; choices instead of empirical absolutes somehow derived from reason.  One
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example of a transhumanist acknowledging the pre-rational roots of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; transhumanist values is anti-aging activist and IEET Fellow Aubrey de
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Grey&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2008 essay &#8220;Reasons and methods for promoting our duty to extend healthy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; life indefinitely.&#8221; De Grey directly addresses Leon Kass&#8217; emotivist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; argument
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and turns it on its head. What, de Grey asks, is more repugnant than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sickness, aging, and death? Those arguing the anti-aging cause, de Grey
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; concludes, should start from these shared intuitions and prejudices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of starting from reasoned arguments that presume the &#8220;objectivity of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; morality&#8221; and the &#8220;unreliability of gut feelings.&#8221; When I first heard de
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Grey&#8217;s argument, I demurred, thinking he had given away too much to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; emotivists. But that was simply my own fear of letting go of my superior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rational ethical viewpoint.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When I imagine the project of Reason, I think of building a house in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mid-air. I look over at the other houses floating in mid-air, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pre-Enlightenment houses, and they are ramshackle huts of mud daub and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; random flotsam, tied up with string. To get from one room to another in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; neighbors&#8217; houses, you have to crawl to the basement and then up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; laundry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; chute. They sit in darkened rooms with few windows, and none that show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the house is not in fact rooted to the earth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; With the pure, lean precision of Reason we have built our houses of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Kantianism, utilitarianism, liberal democracy, and other clean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; architectural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; marvels, Frank Lloyd Wright structures of thought with lots of windows,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even glass floors. But most of us steadfastly ignore the fact that, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; like our neighbors, we are floating in mid-air. Acknowledging that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all in mid-air and don&#8217;t know how we got aloft in the first place is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; damned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; scary, and we have repeatedly seen people defect from our Enlightenment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; houses with glass floors to our neighbors&#8217; houses of faith and dogma
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; they are not forced to look down. We need to learn the courage to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; acknowledge that we got this thing in the air through an act of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; will&#8212;that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Reason is a good tool but that our values and moral codes are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; grounded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in Reason&#8212;or else we will lose many more people to the forces of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; irrationality in the future.
