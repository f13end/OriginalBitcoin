Hi everyone!

I hope that started all the year fine and that we get involve in exiting
projects together alone the 2010!

In July 2010 I plan to attend Wikimania (the main meeting point of
wikipedians and wiki communities: <A HREF="http://wikimania2010.wikimedia.org/">http://wikimania2010.wikimedia.org</A>). My
plan is to organise a workshop or whatever on the Charter there in order to
reinfoze and build more synergies in these open collaborations areas. Is
there someone else planning to come? In that case let me know.

Apart, I send you below the Call for papers for a research conference
(Wikisym) which it will take place in parallel to Wikimania, in case it is
of your interest.

Kisses! Mayo

======  CALL FOR PAPERS  ======

W I K I S Y M 2 0 1 0

The International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration

<A HREF="http://wikisym.org/ws2010/Call+for+Papers">http://wikisym.org/ws2010/Call+for+Papers</A>

July 7-8-9 in Gda&#197;&#8222;sk, Poland.

Co-located with Wikimania 2010 (Intl. Conference on Wikimedia Foundation
projects, <A HREF="http://wikimania2010.wikimedia.org/">http://wikimania2010.wikimedia.org</A>).

Peer-reviewed and archived in the ACM Digital Library.

SUMMARY

WikiSym, the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration,
will be held this summer in Gdansk, Poland. Starting this year, WikiSym
aims to explicitly broaden its scope, exploring not only the thriving
wiki community, but also other open movements and open collaboration
initiatives. This includes related areas such as open online communities,
collaborative creation of multimedia content (with or without wikis),
and open journalism and publishing, just to list a few examples.

Furthermore, our goal is to establish WikiSym as a venue for the exchange
of information, experiences and practices among an interdisciplinary
audience, including researchers, practitioners, industry representatives
and experts with a wide variety of different backgrounds.

As a result, WikiSym has established 3 complementary tracks to merge the
contributions from such a diverse community:

   * Wiki track: Focused on research in wiki technology,
   wiki websites, wiki communities, and in general any kind
   of initiative pivoting around wiki software.

   * Industry track: This new track will focus on the specific
   needs of enterprises and private companies interested in sharing
   and promoting their experiences around wikis and open collaboration
   projects/products/initiatives.

   * Open collaboration track: This track is a dedicated venue for
   sharing research results and experiences in initiatives that may not
   be built specifically on wiki software, but share the &quot;wiki way&quot;
   of organization. These may include open collaborations, open communities,
   and open movements that allow the interchange of ideas and contributions
   from participants with a range of interests and motivations.

Research manuscripts may be sent to any of these tracks.
However, submitting the same manuscript to more than one
track at the same time is not allowed. Therefore, please
select the most appropriate track for the topic covered in
your manuscript before submitting.

IMPORTANT DATES

   * March 7th: Submission deadline for research papers.
   * March 21st: Submission deadline for Doctoral Symposium proposals,
posters, demonstrations, workshops, panels, tutorials.
   * May 4th: Notification of acceptance for research papers.
   * May 11th: Notification of acceptance for Doctoral Symposium proposals,
posters, workshops, tutorials, panels.
   * July 7-9: WikiSym 2010!

Given the interdisciplinary nature of wikis and open
collaboration initiatives, WikiSym invites contributions in
a wide range of fields.

RESEARCH PAPERS

Research papers present integrative reviews or original
reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical,
or in the development or deployment of novel systems.
We encourage emphasizing lessons learned and providing a
clear concise message to the audience about the relevance
of the work. The paper must place your work in context
within the field, citing related work and indicating clearly
what aspects of the work are new.

Research papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee
to meet rigorous academic standards of publication.
They should be written in English and must not exceed 10 pages
(for full papers) or 4 pages (for short papers). Papers will
be reviewed both with respect to conceptual quality and
clarity of presentation. Authors of accepted papers are
expected to attend the conference in order to present the paper.

Accepted submissions will be published in the WikiSym
proceedings and archived in the ACM Digital Library.

Submitted papers should use the ACM SIG Proceedings Format, see:

<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html">http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html</A>

DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

The Doctoral Symposium is an interactive forum for doctoral
students to receive present and discuss their doctoral work.
Students who are at least one year away from dissertation
completion are invited to submit to the Doctoral Symposium.
Students beginning their research are especially invited to attend.

To submit a proposal send a 2-3 page description of your
dissertation research, including:

   * A description of your work
   * The goals---what contributions will your research generate?
   * The approach---what is being performed to achieve
   the goals? How will results be validated?

Additionally, your adviser must send a brief statement
of your dissertation progress to date and a statement of
recommendation to the Doctoral Symposium chair.

WORKSHOPS

Workshops provide an opportunity for researchers and
practitioners to discuss and learn about topics that require
extended engagement such as new systems, research methods,
standards and formats. A workshop should require participants
to engage with each other for at least half a day. For shorter
sessions, please consider WikiSym's open space format.
A workshop proposal should consist of approximately two
pages describing what you intend to do and how your session
will meet the criteria described above. It should include a
concise abstract, proposed time frame (half-day, full-day)
and one-paragraph biographies of all people relevant to the
submission. Workshop proposals will be reviewed and selected
for their interest to the community. Each workshop will be
allocated a half-day or a full-day and a room.

PANELS

Panels provide an interactive forum for bringing together
people with interesting points of view to discuss compelling
wiki issues. Panels involve participation from both the
panelists and audience members in a lively discussion.
Proposals for panels should consist of approximately two pages
describing what you intend to do and how your session will
meet the criteria described above. It should include a concise
abstract and one-paragraph biographies of all panelists. A panel
submission will be reviewed and selected for their interest to
the community. Each panel will be given a 90-minute time slot.

POSTERS

Poster presentations enable researchers to present late-breaking
results, significant work in progress, or work that is best communicated
in conversation. WikiSym's lively poster sessions let conference attendees
exchange ideas one-on-one with authors, and let authors discuss their
work in detail with those attendees most deeply interested in the topic.

Poster proposals may describe original research, engineering, or
experience reports. Submissions should consist of a two-page extended
abstract outlining the content of the poster. Successful applicants will
be invited to display a poster, 1x2m in size, at a special plenary
session of the Symposium.

DEMONSTRATIONS

Wikis are intended to be used, and no format is better suited for
demonstrating the utility of new wiki research and technology than showing
and using it. If you would like to demonstrate new features or products,
this is the place! Demonstrations give presenters an opportunity to show
running systems and gather feedback. Demo submissions will be reviewed
based on their relevance to the community. A submission should be one
page in length, with a title and a short description of the demo.
The description should include what you plan to demonstrate, what you
hope to get out of demoing, and how the audience will benefit. A short
note of any special technical requirements may be included.
