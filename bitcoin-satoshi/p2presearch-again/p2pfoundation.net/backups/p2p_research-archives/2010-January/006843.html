(English Version)

Social Innovations for a New Era: Contributions from Nonprofits and
the Social Economy.

Third Annual Conference
June 2 to 4, 2010
Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec


ANSER/ARES is a dynamic growing association that is organizing its
third annual conference as part of the Congress of the Humanities and
Social Sciences. ANSER brings together leading academic researchers,
practitioners, consultants, policymakers and community organizations
from Canada and internationally to discuss current and emergent
issues, debates and challenges in the fields of civil society, social
economy, and nonprofit research and practice. Join us for what
promises to be an engaging and provocative conference. The theme for
the third conference at Concordia is: Social Innovations for a New
Era: Contributions from Nonprofits and the Social Economy.

We invite you to submit proposals for individual papers, panels, or
roundtable discussions on topics related to Canadian, comparative, or
international contexts.  Proposals are particularly encouraged that
fit into any of the following areas, broadly defined:

&#8226;       Social Economy: Differing Perspectives
&#8226;       Civil Society and its Challenges
&#8226;       Nonprofits and Charities in a Changing World
&#8226;       Social Enterprises and Social Entrepreneurship
&#8226;        Co-operatives and their Challenges
&#8226;       Community Organizing, &amp; Community Economic Development
&#8226;       Volunteering &amp; Citizen Engagement
&#8226;       Changing Conceptions of Financing
&#8226;       Governance &amp; Management
&#8226;       Public Policy &amp; Government Relations
&#8226;       Communication, Networking &amp; Social Marketing
&#8226;       Community-University Research Partnerships


We also accept proposals of wider relevance, but which may not fit the
categories listed above. We are particularly interested in papers,
panels and roundtables involving collaboration between academics and
practitioners.

Types of Proposals

Proposal Submission Deadline: January 11, 2010

Three types of proposals will be considered: individual papers,
panels, and roundtables, all of which are subject to a peer review.

1)      Paper Proposals

Paper proposals normally present research findings with some link to
or reflection on theory, but they could also be &#8220;think pieces,&#8221;
discussions of research-in-progress, including graduate theses or
dissertations, or reflections on practice. The proposal for a paper
should include: 1) a title; 2) the conference theme being addressed;
3) a 100 word abstract of the presentation; and 4) a 500-word summary
of the argument of the paper, how the issue fits within a wider
literature (as appropriate), and its relevance to research and/or
practice in the areas of interest to ANSER/ARES. You will also be
asked to provide very brief biographical information on the author(s).

2)      Panel Proposals

Panels are collections of three or four papers on a related theme.
Ideally, these papers build upon each other, thereby adding to the
coherence of the panel. Panel organizers are responsible for preparing
an abstract of the panel as a whole. For panels comprising 3
presenters, each individual will be expected to speak for no longer
than 20 minutes; for panels of 4 presenters, each participant will be
expected to speak for no longer than 15 minutes. To allow adequate
time for questions and discussion, the panel chair should ensure that
presenters do not exceed the time limit.

The abstract for a panel should include: 1) a title; 2) the conference
theme being addressed; 3) 250-500 word overview of the focus of the
panel, the coherence of the individual papers around this focus, and
the relevance of the panel to research and/or practice in the areas of
interest to ANSER/ARES; and 4) a 250-word summary of each paper to be
included in the panel. You will also be asked to provide brief
biographical information on each of the authors.

* If you are a member of a panel you are not required to submit a
separate proposal.


3)      Roundtables

Roundtables are well suited to: the discussion of the implications of
an issue for practice; the discussion of research needs or research in
progress around specific topics; or the presentation of contrasting
perspectives on an issue with a designated facilitator. Roundtable
presenters are not expected to provide written papers.

The abstract for a roundtable should include: 1) a title; 2) the
conference theme being addressed; 3) a 500-word overview of the topic
to be discussed, indication of the relationship of the individual
presentations to the topic, and the relevance of the roundtable to
research and/or practice in the areas of interest to ANSER/ARES; and
4) a short summary of the key points of each presenter. You will also
be asked to provide brief biographical information on each
participant.


Submission of Proposals

Proposal abstracts, in either official language, must be submitted
online by January 11, 2010 at:
www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=tSvGZ_2f0lGYrhch5MoPQpHw_3d_3d
or by email to <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">anser.ares at gmail.com.</A> Notification of receipt of the
proposal will be provided. A link to the online system is also
available on our Website at www.anser-ares.ca.

All proposals will be subject to peer review and notification of
acceptance will be provided by February 15, 2010. Authors of accepted
papers (individual and panel) must submit extended abstracts of 5 to 8
pages by May 15th to <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">anser.ares at gmail.com</A>  and to the chair of your
session.
