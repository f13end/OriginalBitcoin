WHY ARE WE HERE? [Good question]
In March, this email newsletter will be eight years old; its sister Doors of
Perception blog will be ten; and the Doors website, where it all gets
archived,
will have been online for sixteen years. That's a lot of content - and to
what
end? The way we see it is that we hang out near the door of the design tent;
look outwards; and tell people about interesting things happening outside.
Sometimes we invite passing strangers into the tent to make new friends. And
from time to time, we set up our own tent when we spot an interesting new
challenge for design. People seem to find what we do valuable - if hard to
place. And we enjoy doing it, even if the business model to pay for it
remains... emergent. But if the the stories below are true, we have to start
doing what we do differently, and soon. All suggestions welcome.

GREENER ON PAPER? [Communicating sustainably - or not]
Are we e-writers really so green and virtuous? There's growing evidence that
humble emails, such as this one, pack a hefty environmental footprint.
McAfee,
for example, calculate that a single spam email generates 0.3 grams of CO2
emissions. On that basis, this newsletter has a ten kilogramme footprint.
Once
the internet's infrastructure costs are factored in, that number probably
underestimates things by a factor of ten. Kris de Decker, in &quot;The monster
footprint of digital technology&quot;, has written an excellent explanation of
the
hidden costs of communications hardware; and Don Carli, who coined the term
&quot;media carbon&quot;, reminds us that &quot;computers, eReaders and cell phones don't
grow
on trees; their spiraling requirement for energy is unsustainable&quot;. Buoyed
by
studies such as these, paper-using industries are fighting back. Martyn
Eustace,
for example, director of the newly-launched TwoSides initiative, states that
&quot;producing and reading a traditional newspaper can consume 20% less energy
than
reading news online for more than 30 minutes...print and paper products can
be
far more sustainable than the equivalent electronic version&quot;. Decker's
argument
is disingenuous. &quot;Far more sustainable&quot; does not mean sustainable: It means,
&quot;unsustainable, but less so than the other way&quot;. Greenwasherish language
games
diminish public appreciation for the many positive actions that the paper
and
fibre industries are engaged in. Framing the question as print vs. digital
is a
bad idea because the life cycles of both print and digital media have
negative
environmental impacts. Don Carli puts it well: &quot;This is not a time for the
print
media pot to call the digital media kettle black. The fact is that neither
print
nor digital media supply chains are sustainable as currently configured&quot;.

TELEPRESENCE - WITH NO ILLUSIONS [Tools for not traveling]
So it seems as if carbon footprint of the &quot;virtual&quot; newsletter you are
reading
is heavier than we thought. But it's still nothing compared to the travel
footprint of its author. For the last nine years my business model has been:
write interesting stuff for free, and then get paid to give talks, run
workshops, and organize conversational festivals. Face-to-face is always
best,
but the carbon footprint of my travel to work has been, and remains,
excessive -
tonnes and tonnes a year from my flights and TGV journeys. For the last
three
years I've reduced the total number of trips by ten percent a year - but
that's
too slow a change. I simply have to do a lot more of my work remotely.
That's
where you can help: tell me of real remote models that work for you, and
how.

LINE LOSS [The problem with videoconferencing]
In power grid design, 'line loss' refers to the waste of electrical energy
due
to inefficiencies in the distribution or transmission system. Line loss
affects
mediated human communication, too. Despite decades of effort by engineers
and
designers, the experience of video-conferencing remains mostly awful. So
what to
do? and how? As a start, there are several events about the subject of
telepresence one could go to this year: in March, &quot;Electrosmog: A Festival
of
Sustainable Immobility&quot; will It will take place in Amsterdam, Riga, New
York,
Madrid, Helsinki, London, Banff, Aotearoa, and Munich. Then, in November,
the
theme of the Saint-&#201;tienne International Design Biennial will be
Teleportation.
In parallel with these events, Caroline Nevejan is editing a special edition
of
the research journal AI and Society about the concept of Witnessed Presence.
Nevejan poses a question: Could the performing arts do better than the
engineers
and designers? After all, artists have practiced orchestration,
dramatization
and choreography for centuries; by now they know how to set a context, how
to
spark the imagination, how to show the unsaid.

TRANSITION - THE MOVIE [More useful than Avatar]
One way is achieve effective eco-communication is to be James Cameron and
spend
$300 million making Avatar. Another way is to be the Transition movement in
which hundreds of communities around the world are both stars in, and users
of,
their own film. 'In Transition' is the first detailed film about the
movement
filmed by those who are making it happen on the ground - communities around
the
world responding to peak oil and climate change with creativity, imagination
and
humour. The film is positive, solutions-focused, and fun. It has has already
been
shown in communities around the world and is now available as a special
edition
two disc DVD set, &quot;beautifully packaged in entirely compostable packaging&quot;.

DESIGNING AN ASSOCIATIVE LIFE [Region-wide social innovation in France]
Government departments responsible for sustainability, or &quot;the environment&quot;,
are too often constrained by small budgets and modest influence. Their very
existence allows traditional departments - &quot;industry&quot;, &quot;economic affairs&quot;,
&quot;finance&quot; or &quot;transport&quot; - to carry on their ecocidal ways as normal. A
growing
number of individuals in government want to work collaboratively with their
peers in other silos - but they are often stymied by a system that imprisons
them. So what to do? Rather than rage against the iniquities of politicians,
a
new French organization called La 27e Region (The 27th Region) has set out
to
help regional governments change by running collaborative projects that
enable
them to experience a new approach to social innovation in practice. Read

READ MY LIPS, NOT (JUST) THE LABEL [Transparency and labeling]
The UK government has published a new food policy, Food 2030. Among the most
feeble of its proposals is that companies should clearly label food with its
country of origin - but voluntarily. As with Copenhagen, we citizens will
have
to do the work that governments cannot or will not do. Some great tools are
becoming available: Platforms to enable citizens to communicate directly
with
the people who make or grow things. We have written here before about
ThingLink,
and about the Fair Tracing project at the Oxford Internet Institute. More
recently, GoodGuide has been launched &quot;to lift the marketing veil from
consumer
products and give shoppers better information about the impacts of what they
buy&quot;. Also welcome is an open source project called SourceMap. This is &quot;a
supply
chain publishing platform dedicated to transparency&quot; that is dedicated to
tracking, documenting, and mapping where all of the components for our
everyday
goods come from. What these projects have in common is a commitment to
openness,
and a degree of socially-grown trust, that today's supply chain monopolizers
will find hard, over the medium and longer term, to compete with.

HAND-MADE CLOTHES FOR ALL? [Platforms for design sovereignty]
Could countries such as Sri Lanka achieve design sovereignty by producing
clothes for customers using communication platforms that connect maker and
designer and customer directly? A radically dis-intermediated relationship
is
feasible technically. But, as with food, a key requirement will be
transparency
conerning costs. Read more at:

Money.

]    OTHER EVENTS

VISUAL VOLTAGE [Design for energy awareness, Berlin]
Myriel Milicevic writes with news of Visual Voltage, a series of Interactive
exhibits at Nordic Embassies in Berlin that explore how to engage different
senses in an awareness of energy consumption. A one-and-a-half day workshop
for
professional designers will explore design strategies for raising awareness
about energy-efficiency without imposing a gloomy feeling of guilt.
<A HREF="http://www.visualvoltageworkshop.de/">http://www.visualvoltageworkshop.de</A>

SUSTAINABLE IN BANGALORE [Sustainability conference]
A conference in Bangalore called &quot;Sustainability in Design: NOW!&quot; will focus
on
opportunities for design research, education and practice in product,
service
and system design. Participants will share swap notes on ways to promote
sustainable systems thinking in design education. The conference concludes a
three year EU-funded programme called LeNS - Learning Network on
Sustainability
- whose partners are Politecnico di Milano; Indian Institute of Technology
(IIT), New Delhi; King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Bangkok; Srishti
School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore; Tsinghua University,
Academy
of Arts &amp; Design, Beijing; Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands;
and
the University of Art and Design (TAIK), Helsinki. 29 September to 1 October
2010. Deadline for abstract submission 31 March.

SOCIAL MEDIA IN BRAZIL [Rate our friends!]
The Knight Foundation has committed to to invest at least $25 million over
five
years in the search for bold community news and social media experiments.
The deadline for entries is now closed, but you can still comment on and
rate
the 320 entries for the 2010 challenge. There are some terrific projects
here,
but the Doors house favourite is MetaReciclagem. MetaReciclagem is an open
network, present in all regions of Brazil, that connects together hundreds
of
people and several organizations with an interest in critical appropriation
of
technologies for social change.

MASS DESIGN OF HEALTH [Coordinating multiple actors in a complex system]
One way to redesign a health system is to allow an army of lobbyists
employed by
insurance companies to do it for you. That has been the the Obama way.
Another
approach, tested in Canada last year, is to design a process that allows all
the
different stakeholders to decide priorities together. From April to June
2009,
close to one thousand health service providers, physicians, community
leaders
and local citizens had a chance to weigh in on health care priorities for
their
region. MASS LBP designed an innovative engagement model to capture this
diverse
range of voices. Their website describes how they did it:

THINKING INSIDE THE BOX [Design tourism]
&quot;Indigenous peoples have been living harmoniously and sustainable with the
Earth
for millennia. They are not only the most affected by climate change, but
also
by its false solutions, such as agro-fuels, mega-dams, tree plantations and
carbon offset schemes&quot;. The World in a Shell project will take a
polliniferoused
container on a journey around the globe to connect with a wide range of
peoples
and cultures. It is scheduled to visit Botswana, Greenland, Mongolia, New
Guinea, Congo, Ecuador, Laos, the Solomon Islands, Mauritania, Rajasthan,
and
Queensland. The idea is that &quot;it will become a metaphorical treasure box of
the
peoples, cultures, living conditions and natural surroundings of these
locations&quot;. This sounds like another example of design students putting more
effort into engineering than empathy - but I am sure the &quot;indigenous people&quot;
they turn up to meet, with their box, will be unfailingly polite and
hospitable.
