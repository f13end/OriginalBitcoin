</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Solar module prices are falling so fast that solar may be able to
</I>&gt;<i> cost-effectively compete with fossil fuels within a matter of months. The
</I>&gt;<i> latest bit of news confirming astounding price drops was from China&#8217;s LDK
</I>&gt;<i> Solar. LDK is a producer of the main component of solar modules (wafers).
</I>&gt;<i> While their second quarter guidance showed a boost in shipments, it also
</I>&gt;<i> lowered their revenue expectations, translating into a cost per watt of
</I>&gt;<i> ~$1.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nanosolar already claims their panels are cheaper than burning coal, and
</I>&gt;<i> they are sold out for eighteen months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you saying all these people are either stupid or lying?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so, let's say they are all stupid and lying. What about wind power?
</I>&gt;<i> Surely it must takes about the same amount of engineering to make and mount
</I>&gt;<i> a wind turbine as to make a car?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The USA has on the order of 250 million cars. Why is this not enough
</I>&gt;<i> material to make (shared) wind turbines for everyone with roughly the same
</I>&gt;<i> amount of effort as went into making the cars?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the USA has enormous car factories sitting idle right now that
</I>&gt;<i> could be used to make windmills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Big problems, but it's a big country. Same for countries in Europe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so wind is never going to take off for some reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's just burn coal and offer some relocation and remediation assistance
</I>&gt;<i> to the South. We just put a few trillion into a banking bailout. Would ten
</I>&gt;<i> trillion US dollars get the South to take the money and deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of global climate change? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so they don't want the money. So, nuclear power breeder reactors, with
</I>&gt;<i> one meltdown a month costing fifty thousand lives each time. Problem solved,
</I>&gt;<i> even given all the solar people were lying, the wind energy people were
</I>&gt;<i> windbags, and the South did not want ten trillion Northern dollars. That's
</I>&gt;<i> only about half a million people killed a year from nuclear power, or less
</I>&gt;<i> than the number of deaths now from coal air pollution etc.:

</I>&gt;<i> Should I call GE to tell them to start building reactors again, or will you
</I>&gt;<i> call them yourself? :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Richard Heinberg &lt;<A HREF="http://www.richardheinberg.com/">http://www.richardheinberg.com/</A>&gt; has published a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crucially important guest post &lt;<A HREF="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5638">http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5638</A>&gt; at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;Peak-Oil thesis&#8221; related Oil Drum website.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This excerpt explains how the subprime trigger was preceded by an oil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crisis, which should be seen as the real cause of the current meltdown.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Richard Heinberg:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&#8220;Continual increases in population and consumption cannot continue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a finite planet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is an axiomatic observation with which everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiar with the mathematics of compounded arithmetic growth must agree,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even if they hedge their agreement with vague references to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;substitutability&#8221; and &#8220;demographic transitions.&#8221; *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except we may not be close to the limit, the limit may change with culture
</I>&gt;<i> and technology, and we have a space program to leave Earth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I outlined a plausible way we could evacuate the entire human race from
</I>&gt;<i> Earth within thirty years with only hundreds of millions of casualties (or
</I>&gt;<i> about another few Spanish flus), not that I would suggest doing it that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *This axiomatic limit to growth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given all those other assumptions that are questionable, as above
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  means that the rapid expansion in both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> population and per-capita consumption of resources that has occurred over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the past century or two must cease at some particular time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except people have probably been saying that for a long time. We were going
</I>&gt;<i> to run out of oil in the 1930s too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But when is this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely to occur?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll have other problems to worry about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *The unfairly maligned Limits to Growth studies,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maligned because they build the outcome into the assumptions? Assume you
</I>&gt;<i> have non-renewable resources everyone depends on and no substitution and you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to run simulations. You know populations will crash when you run
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  published first in 1972
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with periodic updates since, have attempted to answer the question with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis of resource availability and depletion, and multiple scenarios
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future population growth and consumption rates. The most pessimistic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenario in 1972 suggested an end of world economic growth around 2015. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except that in the absence of considering technological innovation (like
</I>&gt;<i> solar PV being cheaper than coal), such forecasts are worthless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *But there may be a simpler way of forecasting growth&#8217;s demise.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like just assuming it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Energy is the ultimate enabler of growth (again, this is axiomatic:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and biology both tell us that without energy nothing happens). Industrial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expansion throughout the past two centuries has in every instance been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on increased energy consumption. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not every instance. Some is from increased energy efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *More specifically, industrialism has been inextricably tied to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> availability and consumption of cheap energy from coal and oil (and more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recently, natural gas).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only by a quirk of social dynamics, with fossil fuels companies interwoven
</I>&gt;<i> into political governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, we've already gone from wood to coal to oil to gas and nukes, so why
</I>&gt;<i> not go to solar? Lots of progressions are hidden in that statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, fossil fuels are by their very nature
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depleting, non-renewable resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even that statement is questionable.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenic_petroleum_origin">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenic_petroleum_origin</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The abiogenic hypothesis argues that petroleum was formed from deep carbon
</I>&gt;<i> deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The presence of
</I>&gt;<i> methane on Saturn's moon Titan is cited as evidence supporting the formation
</I>&gt;<i> of hydrocarbons without biology. Supporters of the abiogenic hypothesis
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that a great deal more petroleum exists on Earth than commonly
</I>&gt;<i> thought, and that petroleum may originate from carbon-bearing fluids that
</I>&gt;<i> migrate upward from the mantle.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in that sense, the oil reserves under the crust may be renewing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, if solar PV is cheaper than coal, why are we talking about
</I>&gt;<i> fossil fuels again?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore (according to the Peak Oil
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thesis), the eventual inability to continue increasing supplies of cheap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fossil energy will likely lead to a cessation of economic growth in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless alternative energy sources and efficiency of energy use can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deployed rapidly and to a sufficient degree. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except that solar is cheaper than coal, in part because a lot of people saw
</I>&gt;<i> that coming. And also fossil fuels have external costs like pollution and
</I>&gt;<i> the destruction of democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Of the three conventional fossil fuels, oil is arguably the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economically vital, since it supplies 95 percent of all transport energy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Further, petroleum is the fuel with which we are likely to encounter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems soonest, because global petroleum discoveries have been declining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for decades, and most oil producing countries are already seeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declines. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except solar is cheaper than coal, so we can all drive electric cars, like
</I>&gt;<i> the ones about to be mass produced in China.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *So, by this logic, the end of economic growth (as conventionally defined)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is inevitable, and Peak Oil is the likely trigger.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that logic? Flawed assumptions? Ignoring obvious alternatives? Ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> the social aspects of a technological infrastructure that caused it to be
</I>&gt;<i> one way when perfectly fine alternatives have existed for a long time and
</I>&gt;<i> were easily within the reach of concerted R&amp;D and were essentially actively
</I>&gt;<i> suppressed to maintain a social status quo?

</I>&gt;<i>  *Why would Peak Oil lead not just to problems for the transport industry,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but a more general economic and financial crisis?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'll admit, people, including myself, do stupid things for all sorts
</I>&gt;<i> of stupid reasons, including group think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; During the past century
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> growth has become institutionalized in the very sinews of our economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is a flaw of modern day economics, including a debt-based money
</I>&gt;<i> supply implemented using a fiat currency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every city and business wants to grow. This is understandable merely
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in terms of human nature: nearly everyone wants a competitive advantage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else, and growth provides the opportunity to achieve it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Human nature is a slippery subject. Especially in regards to competition:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.share-international.org/archives/cooperation/co_nocontest.htm">http://www.share-international.org/archives/cooperation/co_nocontest.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Actually fitness in the biological sense refers only to the capacity to
</I>&gt;<i> produce surviving offspring who in turn live to reproduce. When 'survival of
</I>&gt;<i> the fittest' is understood in this light, it becomes clear that the tendency
</I>&gt;<i> to cooperate contributes far more to fitness than any competitive
</I>&gt;<i> inclination. Raising offspring for early animal-humanity was a difficult
</I>&gt;<i> undertaking, and only those who could work effectively with others were
</I>&gt;<i> likely to succeed. On the other hand, endangering one's own life as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the lives of one's offspring through direct physical competition was a risky
</I>&gt;<i> strategy at best, and those who were genetically predisposed in that
</I>&gt;<i> direction are thought to have died off millions of years ago. Thus, if we
</I>&gt;<i> have inherited any predisposition for intra-species behavior, it is toward
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation. Indeed cooperation is the pervasive, if unnoticed, background
</I>&gt;<i> of human affairs against which we see competition in such stark relief.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But there
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is also a financial survival motive at work: without growth, businesses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governments are unable to service their debt. And debt has become endemic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the industrial system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only because we have a messed up financial system, and so we are attacking
</I>&gt;<i> an entire religion (Islam) in part because they are suggesting maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> should try something different.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; During the past couple of decades, the financial
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services industry has grown faster than any other sector of the American
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, especially because agriculture and now manufacturing are so highly
</I>&gt;<i> mechanized that hardly anyone needs to &quot;work&quot; anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  even outpacing the rise in health care expenditures,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often related to materialistic lifestyle choices, or trying to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> the stress of a broken ideoligally driven economy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  accounting for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a third of all growth in the U.S. economy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What economy? The virtual economy of play money? Or the real economy of
</I>&gt;<i> stuff? Or the peer economy of a free commons like Wikipedia?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you mean the play money economy. OK. So, meaningless for the sake of
</I>&gt;<i> analyzing a physical problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From 1990 to the present, the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ratio of debt-to-GDP expanded from 165 percent to over 350 percent. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essence, the present welfare of the economy rests on debt, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collateral for that debt consists of a wager that next year&#8217;s levels of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production and consumption will be higher than this year&#8217;s.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, sounds pretty correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Given that growth cannot continue on a finite planet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bzzt. Confusion of physical and play money economies. Actually, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> reason, with lots of computer memory, that play money economies can't head
</I>&gt;<i> towards infinity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  this wager, and its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embodiment in the institutions of finance, can be said to constitute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history&#8217;s greatest Ponzi scheme.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. It's only really dangerous thought when the play money and physical
</I>&gt;<i> economies interact though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We have justified present borrowing with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the irrational belief that perpetual growth is possible, necessary, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inevitable. In effect we have borrowed from future generations so that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could gamble away their capital today.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Borrowed what from future generations? Play money? What if they don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to play? Money is a sign of poverty (Iain Banks). What if future generations
</I>&gt;<i> are not poor?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Until recently, the Peak Oil argument has been framed as a forecast: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inevitable decline in world petroleum production, whenever it occurs, will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kill growth.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who said that? I didn't say that. :-) I said &quot;solar PV is cheaper than coal
</I>&gt;<i> right now, or is about to be&quot;. So, if you mean physical growth, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> connection. If you mean play money growth, well, do I really care what you
</I>&gt;<i> do with monopoly money? Maybe I do, but it has nothing to do with real
</I>&gt;<i> physical energy policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But here is where forecast becomes diagnosis: during the period
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from 2005 to 2008, energy stopped growing and oil prices rose to record
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> levels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excuse me? &quot;Energy&quot; stopped growing? Solar PV kept growing. Wind energy
</I>&gt;<i> kept growing. Energy efficiency kept growing (so, more from less).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you mean oil use stopped growing. Well, great. I haven't liked the smog
</I>&gt;<i> or other pollution in the oceans. It's about time, isn't it. What a lovely
</I>&gt;<i> day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By July of 2008, the price of a barrel of oil was nudging close to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $150&#8212;half again higher than any previous petroleum price in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inflation-adjusted terms&#8212;and the global economy was beginning to topple.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I had my way, I'd slap another US$200 a barrel tax on it and
</I>&gt;<i> redistribute the money as a basic income.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> auto and airline industries shuddered;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good riddance. Where is the rail system in the USA anyway? What's with all
</I>&gt;<i> those SUVs rolling over or not having whiplash protection? Volvo can do it,
</I>&gt;<i> why not everyone else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those airlines. Why are people flying so much with all these computers?
</I>&gt;<i> What's so messed up about our society that families can't live closer
</I>&gt;<i> together?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ordinary consumers had trouble for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buying gasoline for their commute to work while still paying their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mortgages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why can't more people work at home? In fact, why do they have to &quot;work&quot; at
</I>&gt;<i> all?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/abolition.html">http://www.whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/abolition.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And why don't they have a basic income that can easily afford basic energy
</I>&gt;<i> use for transportation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And why are they paying interest on mortgages when the banks just magicked
</I>&gt;<i> the money into existence anyway?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.moneyasdebt.net/">http://www.moneyasdebt.net/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consumer spending began to decline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally. So much trash being advertised on TV these days.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By September the economic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crisis was also a financial crisis, as banks trembled and imploded. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good. Let 'em fail. Rather than backstop them with fourteen trillion
</I>&gt;<i> dollars (or whatever it is by now) give that money as a basic income to the
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Given how much is at stake, it is important to evaluate the two diagnoses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the basis of facts, not preconceptions.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Durn right. So, show me some facts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fact one: Solar PV is cheaper than coals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fact two: Fact one is all we need to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That about wraps it up, doesn't it? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *It is unnecessary to examine evidence supporting or refuting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conventional Diagnosis, because its validity is not in doubt&#8212;as a partial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explanation for what is occurring. The question is whether it is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient explanation, and hence an adequate basis for designing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> successful response.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except didn't I just doubt it's relevance or accuracy or interpretation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *What&#8217;s the evidence favoring the Alternative? A good place to begin is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a recent paper by economist James Hamilton of the University of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> California,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> San Diego, titled &#8220;Causes and Consequences of the Oil Shock of 2007-08,&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which discusses oil prices and economic impacts with clarity, logic, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numbers, explaining how and why the economic crash is related to the oil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price shock of 2008. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, sure, economist, numbers, must be right, yawn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except when one is not. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Hamilton starts by citing previous studies showing a tight correlation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between oil price spikes and recessions. On the basis of this correlation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every attentive economist should have forecast a steep recession for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2008.&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; writes Hamilton, &#8220;the relation could account for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downturn of 2007-08&#8230;. If one could have known in advance what happened to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oil prices during 2007-08, and if one had used the historically estimated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relation [between price rise and economic impact]&#8230; one would have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to predict the level of real GDP for both of 2008:Q3 and 2008:Q4 quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accurately.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except solar PV is cheaper than coal. Was that in his report and
</I>&gt;<i> predictions? No, well then why bother citing it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Again, this is not to ignore the role of the financial and real estate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sectors in the ongoing global economic meltdown. But in the Alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Diagnosis the collapse of the housing and derivatives markets is seen as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amplifying a signal ultimately emanating from a failure to increase the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of supply of depleting resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it matter if a resource is depleting if we don't need it anymore?
</I>&gt;<i> Given solar PV is cheaper that coal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Hamilton again: &#8220;At a minimum it is clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that something other than housing deteriorated to turn slow growth into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recession. That something, in my mind, includes the collapse in automobile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purchases, slowdown in overall consumption spending, and deteriorating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumer sentiment, in which the oil shock was indisputably a contributing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factor.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And maybe people are fed up? Maybe real wages have not grown in thirty
</I>&gt;<i> years? Maybe a huge rich-poor disparity has made the market disfunctional
</I>&gt;<i> and only 94% marginal tax rates can set it right again? Maybe Capitalism has
</I>&gt;<i> hit the fan?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.capitalismhitsthefan.com/">http://www.capitalismhitsthefan.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Moreover, Hamilton notes that there was &#8220;an interaction effect between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oil shock and the problems in housing.&#8221; That is, in many metropolitan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> areas,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> house prices in 2007 were still rising in the zip codes closest to urban
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centers but already falling fast in zip codes where commutes were long.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there are other possible interpretations if I tried to think of
</I>&gt;<i> one...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Why Did the Oil Price Spike?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because there are trillions of dollars sloshing around looking for
</I>&gt;<i> speculative homes? Because a Lyme-addled president who was no great thinker
</I>&gt;<i> to begin with launched a stupid war (or really, two) which is destroying the
</I>&gt;<i> USA economy as well as creating huge amounts of international tension?
</I>&gt;<i> Because much of this was predicted in 2003 by the alternative press?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Those who espouse the Conventional Diagnosis for our ongoing economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collapse might agree that there was some element of causal correlation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between the oil price spike and the recession, but they would deny that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price spike itself had anything to do with resource limits, because (they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say) it was caused mostly by speculation in the oil futures market, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little to do with fundamentals of supply and demand.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Confessions of a Recovering Economist&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue21/Stanford21.htm">http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue21/Stanford21.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Step 2: Accept that all our efforts to explain the world have failed.  The
</I>&gt;<i> 'market' is the holiest symbol in all of economics. It's magically automatic
</I>&gt;<i> and efficient. And supply always equals demand. The whole profession of
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream, 'neoclassical' economics is dedicated to the study of markets
</I>&gt;<i> and how they can be perfected. The problem, however, is that in real life
</I>&gt;<i> these idealized 'markets' don't explain much at all. Powerful non-market
</I>&gt;<i> forces determine most of what happens in the economy - things like
</I>&gt;<i> tradition, demographics, class, gender and race, geography, and
</I>&gt;<i> institutions. Indeed, what we call the 'market' is itself a complex,
</I>&gt;<i> historically constructed social institution - not some autonomous, inanimate
</I>&gt;<i> forum. Power and position are at least as important to economics, as supply
</I>&gt;<i> and demand.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe speculators were trying to get all they could out of fossil fuels
</I>&gt;<i> while they could, given solar PV is getting cheaper that coal and oil?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *In this, the Conventional Diagnosis once again has some basis in reality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Speculation in oil futures during the period in question almost certainly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helped drive oil prices higher than was justified by fundamentals. But why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were investors buying oil futures? Was the mania for oil contracts just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another bubble, like the dot.com stock frenzy of the late &#8217;90s or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estate boom of 2003 to 2006?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe investors on that scale were crazy financially obese people with
</I>&gt;<i> an addictive (to wealth) personality disorder?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *During the period from 2005 to mid-2008, demand for oil was growing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially in China (which went from being self-sufficient in oil in 1995
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being the world&#8217;s second-foremost importer, after the U.S., by 2006).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, China is going green now, so that will change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the global supply of oil was essentially stagnant: monthly production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> figures for crude oil bounced around within a fairly narrow band between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 72
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and 75 million barrels per day. As prices rose, production figures barely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> budged in response. There was every indication that all oil producers were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pumping flat-out: even the Saudis appeared to be rushing to capitalize on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the price bonanza.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, why not get a last big boost given solar PV is now cheaper that coal
</I>&gt;<i> and oil (or about to be)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Thus a good argument can be made that speculation in oil futures was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> magnifying price moves that were inevitable on the basis of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamentals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of supply and demand. James Hamilton (in his publication previously cited)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> puts it this way: &#8220;With hindsight, it is hard to deny that the price rose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too high in July 2008, and that this miscalculation was influenced in part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the flow of investment dollars into commodity futures contracts. It is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth emphasizing, however, that the two key ingredients needed to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a story coherent&#8212;a low price elasticity of demand, and the failure of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical production to increase&#8212;are the same key elements of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamentals-based explanation of the same phenomenon. I therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conclude
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that these two factors, rather than speculation per se, should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> construed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the primary cause of the oil shock of 2007-08.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ancient history. We're in a new world where solar PV is cheaper than coal
</I>&gt;<i> and oil.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  We continue our processing of the essay by Richard Feinberg, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oil scarcity to the current crisis and sets clear limits on a eventual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recovery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except who cares, given solar pv is cheaper now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In this excerpt &lt;<A HREF="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5638">http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5638</A>&gt; he explains that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volatility in oil prices, which confuses people, is part and parcel of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Peak Oil thesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really interested in Peak Horseshoe theory, either. Even though
</I>&gt;<i> some people still keep horses and might need horseshoes still.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Richard Feinberg: Why Did Oil Prices Fall? And Why Didn&#8217;t Lower Oil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Prices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lead to a Quick Recovery?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because economists are out of touch with reality and live in a mathematical
</I>&gt;<i> world that has no relation to real technology or real people or real
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *&#8220;The Peak Oil thesis predicts that, as world oil production reaches its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maximum level and begins to decline, the price of oil will rise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dramatically. But it also forecasts a dramatic increase in the volatility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prices.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except the price of oil will fall when no one wants it because PV is
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper than coal, and it puts out less smog too, and doesn't mess up the
</I>&gt;<i> democratic politics of various countries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *The argument goes as follows. As oil becomes scarce, its price will rise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until it begins to undermine economic activity in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except who needs oil anymore?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=renewable+plastics">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=renewable+plastics</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Economic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contraction will then result in substantially reduced demand for oil,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good. The darn stuff is dirty and smelly and hurts fish and other wildlife.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will in turn cause its price to fall temporarily. Then one of two things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will happen: either (a) the economy will begin to recover, stoking renewed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oil demand, leading again to high prices which will again undermine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> activity; or (b), if the economy does not quickly recover, petroleum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production will gradually fall due to depletion until spare production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capacity (created by lower demand) is wiped out, leading again to higher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prices and even more economic contraction. In both cases, oil prices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volatile and the economy contracts. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except what if the physical economy starts moving to cheaper alternatives?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *This scenario corresponds very closely with the reality that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfolding,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though it remains to be seen whether situation (a) or (b) will ensue.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Over the past three years, oil prices rose and fell more dramatically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would have been the case if it had not been for widespread speculation in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oil futures. Nevertheless, the general direction of prices&#8212;way up, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down, then part-way back up&#8212;is entirely consistent with the Peak Oil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thesis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the Alternative Diagnosis.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens when all that speculative money finally flows into renewable
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives in an even bigger way than it has already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Why has the economy not quickly recovered, given that oil prices are now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only half what they were in July 2008? Again, Peak Oil is not the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the current economic crisis. Enormous bubbles in the real estate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finance sectors constituted accidents waiting to happen, and the implosion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of those bubbles has created a serious credit crisis (as well as solvency
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and looming currency crises) that will likely take several years to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even if energy supplies don&#8217;t pose a problem.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of social dynamics going on. Lots of psychology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *But now the potential for renewed high oil prices acts as a ceiling for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic recovery. Whenever the economy does appear to show renewed signs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life (as has happened in May-July this year, with stock values rebounding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the general pace of economic contraction slowing somewhat), oil prices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will take off again as oil speculators anticipate a recovery of demand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, oil prices have rebounded from $30 in January to nearly $70
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently, provoking widespread concern that high energy prices could nip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recovery in the bud. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except the economy will be more and more decoupling from fossil fuels now
</I>&gt;<i> that PV is cheaper than coal. In fact, the only thing that will slow this is
</I>&gt;<i> a continued fall in oil and coal prices because no one wants them anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> But, because they still pollute and have other external costs, I suggest we
</I>&gt;<i> still tax 'em heavily anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *A barrel of oil from newly developed sources costs in the neighborhood of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $60 to produce, now that all of the cheaper prospects have been exploited:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finding new oilfields today usually means drilling under miles of ocean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> water, or in politically unstable nations where equipment and personnel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at high risk. So as soon as consumers demand more oil, the price will have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to stay noticeably above that figure in order to provide the incentive for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> producers to drill.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I don't understand why anyone would bother to do that if solar PV
</I>&gt;<i> is cheaper than coal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Volatile oil prices hurt on the upside, but they also hurt on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The oil price collapse of August-December 2008, plus the worsening credit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crisis, caused a dramatic contraction in oil industry investment, leading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cancellation of about $150 billion worth of new oil production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects&#8212;whose potential productive capacity will be required to offset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declines in existing oilfields if world oil production is to remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means that even if demand remains low, production capacity will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly decline to meet those demand levels, causing oil prices to rise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again in real terms at some point, perhaps two or three years from now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Volatile petroleum prices also hurt the development of alternative energy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as was shown during the past few months when falling oil prices led to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> financial troubles for ethanol manufacturers. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And some difficulties for a more expensive subset of solar manufacturers
</I>&gt;<i> too, it's true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *One way or another, growth will be highly problematic if not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unachievable.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except, regarding physical growth, that solar PV is cheaper than coal. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding play money growth, well, if you include virtual currencies in
</I>&gt;<i> virtual worlds, the sky is the limit. :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treatment of the role of Peak Oil in the current meltdown.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does he make any money out of that somehow? How can one follow the money of
</I>&gt;<i> his fearmongering?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This excerpt features a key argument, which I have seen in most people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have studied the issue carefully: there is no smooth transition to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative future based on renewable energies!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except you just go to Home Depot and buy solar panels and put them up with
</I>&gt;<i> a grid intertie plug you stick in a wall socket?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://worldwatts.com/gadgets/Guerilla solar/">http://worldwatts.com/gadgets/Guerilla%20solar/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The ability to do guerilla solar installations is made much easier by the
</I>&gt;<i> availability of small intertie capable inverters, such as the Trace Micro
</I>&gt;<i> Sine. You connect the solar panels to the inverter, and then make a plug for
</I>&gt;<i> the inverter (instead of a socket) so that it can plug directly into a wall
</I>&gt;<i> socket in the house. The inverter won't operate unless it sees a sine wave
</I>&gt;<i> from the power company, so having a bare three prong plug hanging out won't
</I>&gt;<i> electrocute you (besides, it's normally plugged in). This feature also
</I>&gt;<i> protects linemen from being zapped by your solar panel when they are
</I>&gt;<i> repairing the lines. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Richard Heinberg:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *&#8220;At this point in the discussion many readers will be wondering why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative energy sources and efficiency measures cannot be deployed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solve the Peak Oil crisis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because you would lose advertising revenue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After all, as petroleum becomes more expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ethanol, biodiesel, and electric cars all start to look more attractive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to producers and consumers. Won&#8217;t the magic of the market intervene to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> render oil shortages irrelevant to future growth?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely, eventually. Especially because solar PV is cheaper than coal
</I>&gt;<i> (or soon to be).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *It is impossible in the context of this discussion to provide a detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explanation of why the market probably cannot solve the Peak Oil problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because there is no explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Such an explanation requires a discussion of energy evaluation criteria,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an analysis of many individual energy alternatives on the basis of those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criteria. I have offered brief overviews of this subject previously and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much longer one is in press. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, it doesn't exist because, now that solar PV is cheaper than
</I>&gt;<i> coal, we are just waiting on the production plants for thin film PV to
</I>&gt;<i> expand?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *My summary conclusions in this regard are as follows.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *About 85 percent of our current energy is derived from three primary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sources&#8212;oil, natural gas, and coal&#8212;that are non-renewable, whose price is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely to trend sharply higher over the next years and decades leading to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> severe shortages, and whose environmental impacts are unacceptable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except they will crash in price, given there will be little demand for them
</I>&gt;<i> since solar is cheaper that coal (or will be soon).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  While
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these sources historically have had very high economic value, we cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on them in the future;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not? There will be plenty left for special needs (even some plastics),
</I>&gt;<i> because no one would want to burn them. Still, you're right, people will
</I>&gt;<i> prefer biodegradable plastics that are healthier to manufacture, use, and
</I>&gt;<i> recycle. OK. So people won't want them in the future much. OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  indeed, the longer the transition to alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy sources is delayed, the more difficult that transition will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some practical mix of alternative energy systems can be identified that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have superior economic and environmental characteristics.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, seems like it is happening right now. It would even happen faster
</I>&gt;<i> except many people are waiting to see what even more amazing solar panels
</I>&gt;<i> come out next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *But identifying such a mix is harder than one might initially think. Each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy source has highly specific characteristics. In fact, it has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics of our present energy sources (principally oil, coal, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> natural gas) that have enabled the building of an urbanized society with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high mobility, large population, and high economic growth rates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But are they really happy? Are they great places to raise children compared
</I>&gt;<i> to the villages of old?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, see:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Surveying
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the available alternative energy sources for criteria such as energy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> density, environmental impacts, reliance on depleting raw materials,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intermittency versus constancy of supply, and the percentage of energy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> returned on the energy invested in energy production, none currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capable of perpetuating this kind of society.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Convenient, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not like solar PV was cheaper than coal, is it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not like we could pump water uphill or compress air or heat rocks to
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily store energy, is it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *Moreover, national energy systems are expensive and slow to develop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except when everyone can got to Home Depot and get them installed for
</I>&gt;<i> cheap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Energy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficiency likewise requires investment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, and if &quot;national security&quot; meant anything real, that would all be
</I>&gt;<i> paid for out of the &quot;defense&quot; budget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  and further incremental investments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in efficiency tend to yield diminishing returns over time, since it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impossible to perform work with zero energy input.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Earth keeps going round the Sun with no energy input to its orbit. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> I know, that's not accomplishing anything useful like changing our view of
</I>&gt;<i> the solar system. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, OK, yes, thermodynamics. And if we barely need much energy do do a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of stuff, then what?

</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar</A>

</I>&gt;<i> It sure would make a lot of sense to divert most of the US defense budget
</I>&gt;<i> for a while to intrinsically defending the country by removing a need for
</I>&gt;<i> foreign oil by upgrading northern US homes to all be passive solar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where is there the will

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. I'll grudgingly concede that point. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  there are very few modern

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security is a 1982 book by
</I>&gt;<i> Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins, prepared originally as a Pentagon
</I>&gt;<i> study, and re-released in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. The book
</I>&gt;<i> argues that domestic energy infrastructure is very vulnerable to disruption,
</I>&gt;<i> by accident or malice, often even more so than imported oil. According to
</I>&gt;<i> the authors, a resilient energy system is feasible, costs less, works
</I>&gt;<i> better, is favoured in the market, but is rejected by U.S. policy.[1] In the
</I>&gt;<i> preface to the 2001 edition, Lovins explains that these themes are still
</I>&gt;<i> very current. [2]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One example is Sweden, which obtains most
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of its energy from nuclear and hydropower.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. Swedes are cool. We drive one of their cars. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We only have one car to save money and energy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Another is Iceland, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefits from unusually large domestic geothermal resources not found in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most other countries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Geothermal is almost everywhere, especially if you just focus on the heat
</I>&gt;<i> pump aspect of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even for these two nations, the situation is complex:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the construction of the infrastructure for their power plants mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relied
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on fossil fuels for the mining of the ores and raw materials, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> materials
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processing, for transportation, for the manufacturing of components, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mining of uranium, for construction energy, and so on. Thus a meaningful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy transition away from fossil fuels is still a matter of theory and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wishful thinking, not reality.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except solar PV is cheaper than coal. And it will be a *lot* cheaper real
</I>&gt;<i> soon now. Despite the fossil fuel industry and nuclear industry having
</I>&gt;<i> fought it all the way.

</I>&gt;<i>  *In essence, humanity faces an entirely predictable peril: our population
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has been growing dramatically for the past 200 years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except it has stopped in the industrialized world. Industrialization the
</I>&gt;<i> way we have been doing it is, unfortunately, deadly to our species.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (expanding from under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one billion to nearly seven billion),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hooray! How about fourteen billion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've got room for quadrillions of people in the solar system. Would
</I>&gt;<i> coupons for romantic resorts in the Poconos help?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  while our per-capita consumption of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources has also grown.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Terrific. Just be sure to recycle it all, have zero-emissions
</I>&gt;<i> cradle-to-cradle, and use renewable energy like solar PV (cheaper than coal)
</I>&gt;<i> and we are good to go. And recycling 3D printers would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For any species, this is virtually the definition
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of biological success.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And yet all of this has taken place in the context of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a finite planet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but huge solar system and perhaps infinite universe or infinite metaverse
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  with fixed stores of non-renewable resources (fossil fuels
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and minerals),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any idea how large this planet is and how small people are?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, sure, I've outline a plan to evacuate the Earth in thirty years, if
</I>&gt;<i> you really want to insist on that &quot;finite earth&quot; point having any relevance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a limited ability to regenerate renewable resources (forests,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fish, fresh water, and topsoil),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Grind rock for soil. A lot of people like to work outdoors planting trees
</I>&gt;<i> and stocking fish. In fact, the problem is just that these people who want
</I>&gt;<i> to be outdoors are forced to work stupid pointless guard-duty jobs they hate
</I>&gt;<i> life process health insurance claims instead of just giving everyone
</I>&gt;<i> free-to-the-user health care (which will be cheaper once we stop polluting
</I>&gt;<i> the air with coal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and a limited ability to absorb industrial
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wastes (including carbon dioxide).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. Except we can use our solar PV (cheaper than coal) to recycle the
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. And this guy at TED said how to do it with fungus too:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Paul Stamets on 6 ways mushrooms can save the world&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If we step back and look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> industrial period from a broad historical perspective that is informed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciation of ecological limits,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. I'm with you. The universe can (conservatively) hold about a million
</I>&gt;<i> billion billion quadrillion people:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;[p2p-research] Earth's carrying capacity and Catton&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-August/004123.html">http://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch_listcultures.org/2009-August/004123.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And we have almost seven billion. I can see there will be a limit to growth
</I>&gt;<i> someday. Unless we figure out a way to connect to other empty universes and
</I>&gt;<i> such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if we build space habitats, each with an ecology, then we could have
</I>&gt;<i> quadrillions of Earths worth of ecologies in the universe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so informed by that perspective, I'm right with you...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  it is hard to avoid the conclusion that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we are today living at the end of a relatively brief pulse&#8212;a 200-year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rapid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expansionary phase enabled by a temporary energy subsidy (in the form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cheap fossil fuels) that will inevitably be followed by an even more rapid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and dramatic contraction as those fuels deplete.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Um. Hmmm. What happened to a million billion billion quadrillion people
</I>&gt;<i> living in a quadrillion Earths worth of space habitats?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solar PV is cheaper than coal, remember?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *The winding down of this historic growth-contraction pulse doesn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessarily mean the end of the world,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which world? The one you imagine where solar PV is not cheaper than coal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same world that is debunked here too:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://peakoildebunked.blogspot.com/">http://peakoildebunked.blogspot.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  but it does mean the end of a certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of economy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good riddance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  One way or another, humanity must return to a more normal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pattern of existence characterized by reliance on immediate solar income
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (via crops, wind, or the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than stored ancient sunlight.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now you are talking. Hooray. We agree on something. Until we tap zero-point
</I>&gt;<i> energy, we should work towards supporting a million billion billion
</I>&gt;<i> quadrillion people with solar power! Yeah!! Here comes the sun!

</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZtQh5EIgWQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZtQh5EIgWQ</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *This is not to say that the remainder of the 21st century must consist of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collapse of industrialism, a die-off of most of the human population, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> return by the survivors to a way of life essentially identical to that of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 16th century peasants or indigenous hunter-gatherers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is it you don't like about hunter-gatherers? Sounds like they had more
</I>&gt;<i> fun than we do. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The Original Affluent Society&quot; by Marshall Sahlins
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm">http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A good case can be made that hunters and gatherers work less than we do;
</I>&gt;<i> and, rather than a continuous travail, the food quest is intermittent,
</I>&gt;<i> leisure abundant, and there is a greater amount of sleep in the daytime per
</I>&gt;<i> capita per year than in any other condition of society.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It is possible instead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to imagine acceptable and even inviting ways in which humanity could adapt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to ecological limits while further developing cultural richness,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understanding, and quality of life (more of this below).*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. Let's see, the limit is a million billion billion quadrillion people
</I>&gt;<i> in the universe. I guess I better get to work on zero-point energy and
</I>&gt;<i> inter-multiverse transportation before we reach that limit.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll put that on my to do list. Don't think I'll have time to get to it
</I>&gt;<i> though, too many other fun things to do first. I'll leave it for someone
</I>&gt;<i> else to lend a hand. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvLj72apGLI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvLj72apGLI</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  *But however it is negotiated, the transition will spell an end to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> growth in the conventional sense. And that transition appears to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> begun.&#8221;*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, economic growth as it has been done has been stupid. I'm all for
</I>&gt;<i> doing it differently. :-) Local production using 3D printers and other means
</I>&gt;<i> (including to print solar panels). Peer production using a gift economy and
</I>&gt;<i> a free commons. States that regulate and heavily tax the remnants of the
</I>&gt;<i> market. A well educated populace who engage in learning-on-demand. Those
</I>&gt;<i> kind of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't know what the point of this was. Other than to show how a
</I>&gt;<i> few bad assumptions can ripple throughout mounds of analysis. So, are the
</I>&gt;<i> bad assumptions mine or others?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=grid+parity">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=grid+parity</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One random example:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Grid Parity&quot; by John Quiggin
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2009/05/03/grid-parity/">http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2009/05/03/grid-parity/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ... But looking at the issue again today, I&#8217;m finding lots of claims that
</I>&gt;<i> this &#8220;grid parity&#8221; will be achieved in the next few years, and even one
</I>&gt;<i> company, First Solar, that claims to be already at grid parity with a 12 MW
</I>&gt;<i> plant in Nevada completed last year . Obviously, Nevada is a particularly
</I>&gt;<i> favorable location, and there is plenty of room for judgement in cost
</I>&gt;<i> estimates. Still, looking at a lot of different reports, it seems clear
</I>&gt;<i> that, with a carbon price of say $50/tonne (about 5 cents/kwh for black coal
</I>&gt;<i> and 7 cents/kwh for brown coal), solar will be cost-competitive with coal
</I>&gt;<i> for most places in Australia without any need for fundamental technical
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.
</I>&gt;<i>  The big question is whether the industry can ramp up from its current
</I>&gt;<i> small scale (about 5 GW capacity produced last year) to meet global demands
</I>&gt;<i> for growth and replace a significant part of the existing 4TW of mainly
</I>&gt;<i> fossil-based capacity, with even more needed if we are to have big growth in
</I>&gt;<i> electric vehicles. ...
</I>&gt;<i>  However, in the long run, and with no absolute resource constraints, costs
</I>&gt;<i> should fall further as all elements of the manufacturing chain scale up. And
</I>&gt;<i> over 20 years or so, with continued growth of 20-30 per cent a year, the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary scale would be achieved If so (and assuming contributions from
</I>&gt;<i> other renewable sources) the transition to a post-carbon economy could be
</I>&gt;<i> faster and cheaper than most existing estimates suggest.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so if this is true, why were we not planning our economy around this
</I>&gt;<i> idea twenty years ago? That should be a shocking indictment of the entire
</I>&gt;<i> profession of economics. But, that's not news here, is it? :-)
