Michel-

I made a point by point commentary, but let's look at this another way.

You (like I) have been heavily schooled, and done well in it, and been 
highly praised and rewarded for that. Admitting that was counter-productive 
for our happiness or the survival of humanity would be an incredible 
emotional leap.
   <A HREF="http://www.school-survival.net/">http://www.school-survival.net/</A>

That is kind of like this surreal situation by Monty Python:
  <A HREF="http://mzonline.com/bin/view/Python/BeingEatenByACrocodile">http://mzonline.com/bin/view/Python/BeingEatenByACrocodile</A>
&quot;Here at Lughtborrow are the five young men chosen last week to be eaten by 
a crocodile for Britain this summer. Obviously, the most important part of 
the event is the opening 60 yard sprint towards the crocs. And twenty-two 
year old Nottingham schoolteacher Gavin Watterlow is rated by some not only 
the fastest but also the tastiest British morsel since Barry Gordon got a 
bronze at Helsinki. In charge of the team is Sergeant Major Harold Duke. &quot;

You also work in academia, as do many on this list and many who are the 
backbone of the free culture movement. Admitting that the larger framework 
that leads up to academia is harmful would lead to an incredible amount of 
cognitive dissonance as well as be risky for your livelihood.

Peer-to-Peer, as you have pointed out, is already baselessly being attacked 
as a threat to national security. Adding on to the peer-to-peer movement any 
resistance to schooling may just be too much for it on a practical basis, as 
in opening the P2PFoundation for off-base but easily-believed critical 
remarks like &quot;What? They not only want kids to steal stuff, they want them 
to not get an education, too? What scoundrels!&quot; And look what happened to 
this guy:
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates</A>

On the other hand, if what I say is true, schooling (at least in the USA) is 
one of the biggest limiting factors to a peer economy. So, it's a sad and 
difficult situation, all around IMHO, whatever position it is practical or 
emotionally tenable to take on it. And of course, I also may be completely 
wrong. :-) It's OK with me if you think so. :-)
