<PRE>Thanks Paul for pointing out the absurdity of this article and for
developing knowledge tools to plot and scale abundance. ;) The words that
follow I hope nourishes further insight into these regards.

The 60 jobs draft assumes continued centralization and specialization all of
which can only be secured by general public distrust. Trust must be secured
through technological mechanisms to scale large populations. We're already
seeing this trust spread as folk come online to share their personal
ambitions.
We will see, as I am seeing more with each day, that we were afraid of a
phantom. In so doing, this phantom was given life as a legitimate fear, but
only because knowledge was scarce and mismanaged for central gain with
neighbors silent to secure these centralisms or specializations to subsist
in the highly competitive platform these fears and uncertainties created.

Answer: Automated adaptive knowledge representations and access to
materials. Trust and the fruits that come of it in such a world are
'built-in'.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Try finding a program in space tourism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1.Medical Roboticist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> New technology is doing amazing things for medical patients these days,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially in the world of robotics. We aren&#8217;t quite at a Six-Million
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dollar Man level yet &#8211; but we&#8217;re getting awfully close. From physical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therapy exoskeletons to new and improved forms of prosthetic attachments,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> science-minded individuals will be needed to help develop medical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology that is better, stronger, and faster than it ever was before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robots at AI will design and repair future robot. Much medical robotics
</I>&gt;<i> will be replaced by prevention, including better nutrition, better sleep,
</I>&gt;<i> less bad stress and more good stress in meaningful work. Specific cheap
</I>&gt;<i> devices will replace many medical interventions, for example a surgical wand
</I>&gt;<i> will replace most of what dermatologists charge for -- just press it against
</I>&gt;<i> a mole, and the mole is removed, and the material scanned for cancer. So,
</I>&gt;<i> most doctors will be put out of work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2.Genetic Counselor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As genetics continues to be fine-tuned, doctors will be able to run tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to predict all manner of markers and conditions. Genetic counselors have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the job of helping families make decisions about their future children in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regards to available genetic technologies. At the present, according to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MSNBC, &#8220;about 2,000 counselors are recognized by the American Board of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Genetic Counseling.&#8221; As technology improves and becomes more widespread,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect the need for counselors to grow right along with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will mostly be automated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3.Respiratory Therapist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The atmosphere isn&#8217;t what it used to be. Between congested highways, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pollutants of industry, and just plain old stress doing a number on our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bodies, respiratory problems like asthma are rapidly on the rise. Under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these conditions, it comes as no surprise that the U.S. Bureau of Labor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Statistics is reporting an extremely good job outlook for respiratory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therapists. Practitioners and technicians from varying levels of training
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be needed increasingly to help future generations breathe well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against all odds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solar panels, electric cars, and zero-emission industries will end most
</I>&gt;<i> smog.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.Bioinformatician
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whenever new terrain is charted, maps must be drafted to document and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand the new discoveries. Not only is this true in geography, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in biology as well. As genomic and molecular research continues to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intensify over the years, the science community will need plenty of young
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bioinformatics majors to map, analyze, create 3-D models of and compare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DNA and protein structures &#8211; hopefully resulting in better understanding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and treatment of genetics in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of this will be automated. The rest will be a DIYBio hobby activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.Stem Cell Researcher
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stem cell research has been a controversial topic since the day it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started gaining plausible ground, entrenched in a war of progress and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ethics. Still, science finds a way. Already, researchers may have found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an alternative to embryonic stem cells that may put the ethical battle to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rest. If this is the case, more researchers than ever will be needed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> develop cures for diseases, genetic enhancements, and whatever other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secrets these cells may hold.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, a hobby, backed by computer simulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6.Custom Implant Organ Designer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It wasn&#8217;t so long ago when organ transplants were the stuff of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> science-fiction novels. Now human ears are growing on mice for science,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mouse brain cells are growing within robots for art, and the next wave of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientists are using gel-suspended cell cultures to draw custom-made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organs for implants from scratch. When it comes to biomedical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering, the sky is the limit, and young ingenious scientists are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed all the time to keep on searching for the next big breakthrough.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And shortly this will all be straightforward, same as few people use a
</I>&gt;<i> custom content management system and instead use one off-the-shelf. So, this
</I>&gt;<i> will be a straightforward thing requiring little design within twenty years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  7.Massage Therapist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> City populations only get more and more crowded as time goes on, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stresses will only increase as towering office jobs become more prevalent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and intense. But you have the power not only to do something about it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but to get paid doing it. As the economy levels out and city life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stresses become more compact, look for the already booming massage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therapy industry to go through the roof.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better society will have less distress and more positive stress. While
</I>&gt;<i> massage is important, jobs in this will decline, especially as people have
</I>&gt;<i> more free time and healthier community relationships.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8.Nurse
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As necessary as nurses are, it may stand to reason that we will never run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of nurses&#8230;but actually, that is exactly what is happening. According
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the American Association of College of Nursing (AACN), our country is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;in the midst of a nursing shortage that is expected to intensify as baby
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boomers age and the need for health care grows.&#8221; Nurses will only be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in demand as time goes on, and it&#8217;s a profession that will never go out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of style.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better medical information, better devices, better medicines, and better
</I>&gt;<i> robotics will eliminate the need for most nurses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  9.Home Health Care Aide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An entire generation is getting older, and it&#8217;s a big one. As the Baby
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Boomers start to collectively reach senior citizenship, home health care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aids will be in hot demand to help elderly folks continue to live at home
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with dignity, assisting with chores and care and providing valuable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> company.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, better computers, better assistive devices, better medicines, better
</I>&gt;<i> robotics, and better powered exo-skelatons will help with much of this. And
</I>&gt;<i> with more free time, family members will be able to help out more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10.Pharmacist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another classic. Just as the rising collective age of Americans is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leading to a need for more health care workers, the same thing is also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leading to a need for more prescription drugs and those who know how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prescribe them. In addition, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a growing number of pharmacies are starting to offer on-site diagnoses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and patient care, stretching the amount of skilled and well-trained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pharmacists needed. The demand for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is expected to rise by over 30% in the next decade.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only will this be automated, people will print most of their own pills
</I>&gt;<i> at home if they need any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 11.Medical Records
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Administrator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What&#8217;s so high tech and futuristic about a medical records administration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> career? As a matter of fact: everything. The world of information is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rapidly changing, and medical records are at the forefront with a huge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> push toward going digital. Once doomed to navigate halls of bulging paper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files, the medical records administrators of the future will need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tech-savvy and quick on the draw with digital databases, in a field where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast information recall can mean the difference between life and death.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All automated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  12.Nutritionist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The United States is dealing with an obesity epidemic of epic proportions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8211; it affects 32% of adults over 20, and leads to complications that add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up to $147 billion a year in health care expenditure. Something has to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done, and a healthy diet is a great start. In addition to a growing need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for nutritionists and dieticians to help combat obesity, there will be an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increased need for nutritionists who can work with elderly patients on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjusting their diets to improve health in the face of age-linked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already automated:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 13.Dentist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not so futuristic in theory, but certainly a perennial. No matter how far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the foreseeable future, we will always need our teeth &#8211; and we only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get one natural set, so it pays to treat them well. Unfortunately, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dental profession is seeing a shortage as populations grow while the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> average age of dentists rises, with many dentists retiring faster than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can be replaced. That&#8217;s good news for new crops of prospective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dentists, who will find themselves highly in demand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better nutrition and better mouth bacterial cultures will make cavities
</I>&gt;<i> history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  SCIENCE and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ENGINEERING
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 14.Space Tour Guide
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the time comes for space travel, tourism will be there at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forefront, giving the wealthy and the curious a taste of the exotic. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who will narrate the tours and bring the majestic vistas of outer space
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to life? You, if you become a space tour guide. It&#8217;s not as far off as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some might think &#8211; multimedia mogul Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Galactic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space tourism venture is already garnering some serious financial backing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8211; so anyone interested would do well to start brushing up on their public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speaking skills.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many people going to a major city use a tour guide much? Going to space
</I>&gt;<i> may in a few decades be as rountine as going to a foreign city, and if you
</I>&gt;<i> need a guide, computers and robots will guide you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 15.Robotics Technician
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From precision factory work to precision surgery, a robot&#8217;s place in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> society is growing every day. Of course, skilled workers are needed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tend to robots: to build them, maintain them, and keep them running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smoothly. Well-versed in both sturdy classic machinery and cutting-edge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology, technicians of the future will play an important part in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greasing the gears that keep the world turning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robots will fix the robots. Robots will be designed modularly for easy
</I>&gt;<i> repair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 16.Nanotechnologist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> True, science is expanding &#8211; moving ever outward with space probes and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grand robotic and architectural creations &#8211; but it is contracting just as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surely. Nanotechnology is the study of matter on a molecular scale:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manipulating individual atoms, building structures by the nanometer. It&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a fairly new practice where sciences are concerned, due mostly to it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously being physically impossible, but scientists predict it to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible applications ranging widely from medicine to electronics and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even new forms of energy production.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People will make better designs for a hobby.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  17.Simulation Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Advanced 3D technology is improving everyday (already movies are a far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cry from the headache-inducing red/blue lenses of yesteryear), and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn&#8217;t take long for holographic and other simulation-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies to follow suit. According to UCSD&#8217;s Jacobs School of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Engineering dean Frieder Seible, in an interview with MSNBC, &#8220;simulation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be in every industry and every engineering field.&#8221; The age of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-size interactive holodecks is coming, and Physics and Comp-Sci
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whizzes will be at the helm of it all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 18.Energy Resources Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where does our energy come from? Mostly from electricity and oil, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps not for long. As global concern over environmental issues grows,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a race is on to create new major sources of energy. New engineers with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fresh outlooks are greatly needed to help develop more effective wind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turbines, more compact solar panels, safer atomic fission, and the next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big thing in energy production.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Print a solar panel in your home 3D printer. Print a robot to put it on the
</I>&gt;<i> roof.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  19.Aerospace Engineer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While MIR and our probes are impressive, our country&#8217;s space program has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by and large stalled for quite some time. Where will you be when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starts up again? It&#8217;s only a matter of time before thoughts turn once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again toward exploring the great frontier of space, trekking to new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> planets and seeking out new life and civilizations &#8211; and with the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering degree, you could be the one to design the craft that makes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it all possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 20.Biorefinery Plant Manager
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A huge talking point of the last presidential election was the potential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of biofuels as a valid replacement for our finite sources of petroleum.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From corn-based to grain-based ethanol, biomass technology has become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formidable opponent to our current fuel situation. If efforts continue at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their current pace, it won&#8217;t be too much longer before biorefinery plants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are cropping up with the frequency of oil rigs, all of them needing plant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workers to make sure the crops flow smoothly on their journey to powering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the nation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby, like gardening, for what 3D printing does not do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 21.Laboratory Technician
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No man is an island, and that includes scientists: behind every good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientist is a crackerjack team that gets the job done. A laboratory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technician takes care of everyday tasks like testing, sampling,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measuring, recording data, and generally ensuring that experiments in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> progress are running smoothly. With so much focus on science and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology in industry, the job outlook for taskmaster lab technicians is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite promising.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computers will supervise that. Some already do.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.robotliving.com/2009/04/03/robot-scientist-does-own-experiments/">http://www.robotliving.com/2009/04/03/robot-scientist-does-own-experiments/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 22.Transportation Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In just a few short years, rising oil costs and economic downturns have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> led most of the world to shun former single-serving social status titans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like the Hummer and the Segway, while falling head over heels in love
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the Prius and the light rail. The face of transportation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing, and engineers are needed to help design newer, cleaner, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more efficient ways of moving people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Electric cars are design to design and maintain than fossil fuel ones. We
</I>&gt;<i> already have such designs. Nothing to see here. Draw a line on a map and let
</I>&gt;<i> the robots put in the rail. What's more, let the optimizing software pick a
</I>&gt;<i> good line on the map.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 23.Seed Production Technician
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Changing technology changes all factions of our lives, and even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agriculture is getting a different look these days. With the rise of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factory farms, jobs are becoming increasingly parsed out by specialty.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Large corporations like Monsanto are consistently looking for skilled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workers in fields like seed production, to distribute and produce the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crops that keep the country running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby. Also, people will print seeds in special 3D printers linked with
</I>&gt;<i> DIYBio equipment..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 24.Technical Writer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Robots, rocket ships, computers, prostheses and enhancements: all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these are new or evolving technologies, and none of them are exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple and self-explanatory. Someone needs to be there to write the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manuals for these products, and that person could be you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The best part about emerging technology is that it never goes out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> style. Whether your interest is chemistry, biology, physics, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering, scientists of all disciplines are always needed to think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hypothesize, develop, and create. They are needed by private corporations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and government agencies alike, to build better weapons for the army and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better toys for the holiday store shelves. Inventors are necessary to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> progress, and will be needed for as long as progress of civilization is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an option.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While it&#8217;s always been popular with the eco-conscious, now organic food
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is more popular than ever before. Taking up nearly 10% of the food and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beverage market, a tenfold increase from a decade prior, so many people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are clamoring for the &#8220;organic&#8221; label that it&#8217;s on the verge of going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mainstream. When the scales do finally tip in organic food&#8217;s favor (an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event that no doubt will be happening some time in the next ten years),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more farmers, producers, and scientists will be needed than ever before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to improve organic farming techniques and just simply grow the food that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the population is demanding.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 27.Sustainability Officer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sustainability has become a real concern among businesses, but it can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard for busy execs to find the time to learn all the ropes. Instead,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many companies have started hiring on eco-savvy individuals as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;sustainability officers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a new title, and it entails finding,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> researching, and implementing eco-friendly policies that are of the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefit to the company at hand. Green Tech Media describes it as a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like IT Techs in the 1980s, helping older businessmen navigate a strange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new world &#8211; once technology, now sustainability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a culture shift, sustainability and eco-friendly will be done as a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of course.

</I>&gt;<i>  28.Waste Management Consultant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Waste is a problem on our planet, and someone has to deal with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overflowing landfills. Consultants will be needed, with backgrounds in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biology and chemistry, to bring new ideas to the table on how to break
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down and eliminate the tons of refuse currently clogging waterways and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stretches of land. In addition, scientists are needed more than ever to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come up with improved ways of dealing with e-waste, which is becoming a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bigger problem with every passing year.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What&#8217;s in your dinner? In the near future, that answer may get a lot more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical. Food science is huge: in genetics, vegetables are being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified for more pest-resistant corn and frost-resistant tomatoes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spliced with fish genes. In agriculture, farmers are looking for better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways to grow food more organically on a local scale. Meanwhile, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chemistry, scientists are trying to build more effective supplements to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make us stronger and healthier on less. No matter what your scientific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest, there&#8217;s a way to incorporate our most important fuel of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> day.

</I>&gt;<i>  30.LEED Certified Architect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These days, even constructing houses is a delicate science. People tend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to want the best for their new homes, and increasingly this means paying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> special attention to environmental awareness concerns. For new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up-and-coming architects, the smartest career move available is to invest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time and study into LEED certification, giving you the training to draft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buildings that are ecologically state-of-the-art. Your clients will thank
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you, and the Earth will thank you more.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many electricians these days are still working within the same tired old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paradigm of energy resources &#8211; but we&#8217;re approaching a new age of energy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the industry will soon require a heavy influx of fresh new faces that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflect that. In the past, industry standards dictated your career to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consist mostly of repairing your standard air conditioners, radiators,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and electric lines. Soon, however, these tasks will be upgraded to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installing and troubleshooting solar panels and integrated home climate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control centers as everyday consumers continue to embrace a new world of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy in all its sources.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Water is one of our most vital resources, and hydrologists study both the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> form and function of water: its distribution, its physical properties,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and patterns of circulation and rainfall. In recent years though, both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> private and government sectors are recruiting the talents of hydrologists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for other purposes, namely conservation. With their reservoir of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge, hydrologists can help to predict drought zones, analyze
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quality of newly discovered water sources, and judge how safe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> construction projects are for surrounding bodies of water &#8211; all functions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that make the skills of a well-trained hydrologist as desirable as water
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 33.Sustainable Urban Planner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Individually, engineers and architects are all working on building
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cleaner and greener homes, offices, and vehicles. What about someone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, who ties all of those individual pockets together into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cohesive city structure? Sustainable urban planners work hard to solve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current spatial problems like urban sprawl and excess pollution with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> innovative ideas, or even build separate communities known as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;eco-villages.&#8221; Who will construct the best solution since vertical

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The work of a geophysicist is in the study of the earth. Earthquakes,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> atmosphere, the shifting of the continents &#8211; these are all within a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> geophysicist&#8217;s realm of study. While some find work as professors, most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are employed elsewhere. Some geophysicists work for government agencies,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working with architects and predicting earthquake zones. Others work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mining, oil, and gas companies, charting magnetic forces and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probability of natural resources from location to location, making them a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Preferred modes of vacation vary from person to person, and there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new trend emerging in the travel world: ecotourism. Defined by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> International Ecotourism Society as &#8220;responsible travel to natural areas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people,&#8221; the main emphasis is on building awareness, fostering cultural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensitivity, and minimizing impact on the destinations visited. Thus far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ecotourism has collected a niche following, but with our country&#8217;s recent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enthusiasm over going green, it&#8217;s an industry poised for mainstream

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If solar power is the weathered veteran of the alternative energy trade,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then wind turbines are the bright young upstart. As natural as the sun
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and just as plentiful, wind power is being hailed as one of the best new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> energy forms. At the moment, production is rocky due to the economy, but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back in the 1990s, hackers were demonized as the reckless pirate scourge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the internet. Who would have thought that, a short time later, their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dexterous computer skills could be put to good use? Cyber security is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swiftly growing industry, and few reveal site weaknesses and better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who know a thing or two about exploiting them. Interested in

</I>&gt;<i>  38.Media Search Consultant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The internet is major in business these days, and being seen is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything. Nothing says &#8220;you&#8217;ve made it!&#8221; like showing up on the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page of a Google search, and media search consultants can make that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen. Armed with search engine knowledge, a good media search
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consultant finds clever keywords and the right ways to drive up traffic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and take your website to the top (of search engine ranking)!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If nobody needs money, why would people pay for this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 39.Data
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Technologist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Every year we are finding new ways to exchange and process data. We are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conducting more business from the screen of a mobile phone than we ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could have thought possible ten years ago. It&#8217;s all thanks to data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologists, who are constantly designing and developing new technology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from ever smaller processing chips to innovative operating systems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finding the next big thing. If we&#8217;re conducting business from the display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a cell phone today, who knows where we&#8217;ll be in another ten years?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Common standards will make this not too important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  40.Interface Designer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pretty soon your PC won&#8217;t be the only interactive digital element of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> home. It&#8217;s probably already started with your television, but more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientists are needed to work on ways to streamline the home experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From integrated entertainment elements to simpler multifunction pads to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 41.Distance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Education Consultant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The future of college is online. There has been a boom in the distance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> learning sector over the past few years, as people struggle to balance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting a college education with holding down a day job to support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves or a family in this economy. It&#8217;s a fairly new teaching model,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, and improvements are needed. In turn, more distance education
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consultants will be needed to develop new techniques and use innovation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to solve any and all current problems within the structure of distance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> learning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Learning on demand through the internet or via simulation will make this

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The internet is faster than it&#8217;s ever been before&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can&#8217;t be faster still. The more people get online and the more data is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transferred on a daily basis, the more innovation is needed to transfer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that data faster and more efficiently. Computer science majors with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest in the inner workings of the World Wide Web could find a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rewarding career advancing the technology of the hypertext transfer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 43.Computer Forensics Analyst
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Crime takes many forms, and evidence is left everywhere if you know where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to look. Sometimes evidence is locked away within computers, and that&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when computer forensics analysts are called in. In our generation and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those to follow, computers and other data devices are found in nearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every household, making computer forensics a hot career commodity. With a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solid education in computer science and a clever analytic mind, you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spearhead the next trend in CSI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Less property crime and money-motivated identity theft with more abundance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 44.Quality Assurance Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As new technology evolves, someone has to be on the frontline to observe,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test, and suggest corrections for every prototype that emerges. These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brave soldiers are known as QA Engineers, and the need for more sharp,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analytical, computer-savvy minds will be huge as digital applications,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devices, and components continue to stock our shelves at an exponential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of this will be automated. Much already is. But yes, in general, of
</I>&gt;<i> all these &quot;jobs&quot;, this one is the most essential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 45.Cloud Computing Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Look up &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; on Wikipedia and, faced with a 20 page thesis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comprehensible only to comp-sci graduate students, you may assume it has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing to do with you. Quite the contrary. Facebook, Wordpress, Flickr,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gmail: wherever you can store data and access it from any internet port,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cloud computing is to be thanked. Savvy engineers are needed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brainstorm ways to streamline processes, cut costs, and enhance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usability.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 46.Internet Crack Team Volunteer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The internet is near limitless, but it is also fragile. Its integrity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rests on the back of an elite group of programmers with the skills and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the know-how to find errors, navigate the tenuous web of the internet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and restore service to damaged sectors. So far this job is selfless and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volunteer only, but as the world becomes more dependent on internet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service, it stands to reason that a few will find careers for themselves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by doing what they&#8217;ve so thus far done for free.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already hobby. Why will it really change?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 47.Integrated Digital
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Media Specialist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once, media outlets mostly worked independently: newspapers, film reels,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glossy magazines were all completely separate entities. Thanks to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advent of the internet, however, media forms are starting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conglomerate. The journalist of the future must know how to harness the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power of multimedia, working with photography, video, sound and written
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> word to create a well-rounded picture of events that will stimulate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> average media-saturated mind.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 48.Casual Game Developer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PC and console video games have always been a mainstay of the gaming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> industry, but that industry is changing. With the advent of the internet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mobile applications, casual games have captured the hearts of people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who might not otherwise be into gaming but appreciate those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mini-distractions throughout the day. Advertisers have taken notice as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well &#8211; high click rates for game-associated ads have made casual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> web-based gaming a rewarding pursuit for developers on various levels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby. Better frameworks and design tools will make this easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  49.Mobile Application Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Progress in mobile technology has been swift and immense &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long ago that cell phones resembled bricks and car phones were a sign of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wealth. Now, mobile phone use has spread throughout the ranks and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology has seriously blurred the line between phone, PDA, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personal computer. The mobile media industry is continuing to rise in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revenue, and as technology continues to become more sophisticated, more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers will be needed to ensure its upward climb. &#8230;AND BEYOND!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Standards will come to dominate this already saturated market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  50.Intelligence Analyst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The world can be a scary place, but intelligence analysts help the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general public to sleep a little more soundly at night. Usually working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the military &#8211; but sometimes for private interests &#8211; intelligence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysts examine information compiled from different intelligence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operatives (think James Bond types), make sense of that information, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plot the next move of terrorists and villains before they make them. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the world&#8217;s political climate, intelligence analysts are always in need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to save the day one encrypted file at a time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby. Also, the general populace will do more of this as time goes by.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  51.Corrections Officer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, as the earth&#8217;s population continues to multiply, one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the side effects is that the prison systems start to overfill. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addition, new &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; legislations are demanding longer prison
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sentences and tighter control on inmates. Thanks to these circumstances,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Bureau of Labor Services is projecting growth for corrections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> officers in the near future, in both the public and private sectors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Less property crime and less stress through increasing abundance means less
</I>&gt;<i> prisons. For those who need to be monitored, software, smart clothing, and
</I>&gt;<i> robots will do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  52.Sarbanes-Oxley Specialist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was introduced in 2002, to better regulate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> financial practices within the corporate sector. Observance of the act is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not a choice: all businesses, no matter how large or small, are required
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to comply. It isn&#8217;t always simple, however, which is why many companies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are hiring Sarbanes-Oxley specialists to work with their auditors to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design business plans that both benefit the company and fall within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> walls of compliance with the act. A fairly new profession, it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poised to become a booming career choice for anyone with a mind for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business and accounting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the market is less important over time (local 3D printing, a free
</I>&gt;<i> commons created by peers), this will be less important over time. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> Google and other tools will make this easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 53.Tax Examiner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nothing can be said to be certain in life, except for death and taxes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tax examiners have been around since practically the dawn of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> civilization, but as long as people are doing their taxes, tax examiners
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be needed to check over those taxes and make sure that every credit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exemption, and addition is perfectly kosher.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mostly automated. And as less of the economy goes through the market, taxes
</I>&gt;<i> will get less important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  54.Regulatory Compliance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Officer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you a stickler for regulations? If you&#8217;re interested in a career as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regulatory compliance officer, it could really get you somewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regulatory compliance officers work with corporate and administrative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> staff, ensuring that procedures at companies fall within acceptable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boundaries for federal and state regulations. Just like tax officers, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as we have a functioning government there will always be a need for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compliance officers to keep things in order.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better design will make it easy to comply, so with more compliance, social
</I>&gt;<i> norms can enforce much of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 55.Small Business Owner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This one is really quite simple: there has never been a better time than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right now to be a small business owner. Thanks to the internet, it&#8217;s easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get your products to the public without a third party or the massive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pull of corporate backing. If you have the ideas and the gumption (and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business degree for the know-how can&#8217;t hurt), then you have a mighty good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chance of making your business plan work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are less needs for small businesses with more local 3D printing and
</I>&gt;<i> the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 56.Welding Technologist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In a future world full of technology and cold metal science, few skilled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tradesmen will be in higher demand than welders. Whether fitting together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pieces for a factory machine, or repairing vital oil pipelines under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ocean, corporations need welders now and will only need them more in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future. In case the job security doesn&#8217;t sound convincing enough,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to Popular Mechanics most welders leave trade school making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $17-20 per hour.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robots already do much of this. Better tools and better robots will deskill
</I>&gt;<i> this even more so it is DIY for home, and automated for mass production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 57.Employment Recruiter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Quite simply, a growing population demands a growing number of jobs, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the job-hunting climate in our country isn&#8217;t always the kindest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regardless of our economy&#8217;s fluctuations, ever larger masses of people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be flocking to employment agencies to help them find suitable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> careers in a time when &#8220;suitable careers&#8221; are far from a free-flowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commodity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As above, with so little employment, recruiters are less needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 58.Financial Engineer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Entrenched in both finance and technology, the financial engineer is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unique animal. Financial engineers are well-versed in finance and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mathematics, money and technology, and the relationships between them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unlike risk-taking stock market cowboys, financial engineers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finances will be less important, since &quot;money is a sign of poverty&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  59.Quantitative Finance Analyst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also known affectionately as &#8220;quants,&#8221; quantitative finance analysts are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the numerical wizards of the finance world. Rather than gamble stocks and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bonds based on trends and feelings, quants employ mathematical concepts,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patterns, and even calculus to better understand investments and offer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quality solutions for investors. If this line of work interests you,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rethink that economics major: most quants hold degrees in physics and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mathematics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't one meltdown and great depression enough? See the above section on
</I>&gt;<i> automated prisons. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  60.Virtual Services Worker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The internet has changed everything, from the way we communicate to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way we handle daily transactions. Role playing wonderlands like Second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Life may have started out purely recreational, but forward thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> captains of industry have established nightclubs, shops, and even online
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> colleges within its cyber-walls. Of course, someone has to keep those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> establishments running. As more people venture into virtual reality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherworlds, more people will be needed to conduct sales and offer a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friendly personal voice, without ever leaving home.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hobby or automation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ======
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the short term (ten years), maybe some of these may be new jobs for a
</I>&gt;<i> while. In the long term (thirty to fifty), nope, there are not many jobs
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People still just don't get the economic shift yet that is happening
</I>&gt;<i> through better design and Moore's law.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A refinement on my previous equation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jobs = (Demand + War + Schooling - Abundance)) / (Automation + Design)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Demand is limited (the best things in life are free or cheap).
</I>&gt;<i> War and compulsory schooling are evil.
</I>&gt;<i> Automation and Design are increasing.
</I>&gt;<i> Abundance is increasing faster than decay.
</I>&gt;<i> Given that, plot the curve of jobs. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or from my comments here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/openvirgle/browse_thread/thread/7e07beba08619e48/c3502bcedfffb5ce?hl=en&amp;q=fernhout+money#c3502bcedfffb5ce">http://groups.google.com/group/openvirgle/browse_thread/thread/7e07beba08619e48/c3502bcedfffb5ce?hl=en&amp;q=fernhout+money#c3502bcedfffb5ce</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me refine my corollary to Iain Banks' statement:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Money is a sign of poverty&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> into a living proportionality so you AP Calculus fans can differentiate and
</I>&gt;<i> integrate it over time, just for fun. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fernhout's Law of Money: &quot;The degree to which money (or ration units) needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be handled in an organization (or a society) is inversely proportional
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> the degree of imagination, skill, freedom, and community present.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or in mathematical notation: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  M = 1 / I * S * F * C
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since peer-to-peer increases community, skill, freedom, and imagination,
</I>&gt;<i> that decreases the need for jobs and money. :-)
