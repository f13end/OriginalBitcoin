<PRE>By the way, I've been doing a super-marathan to go through my backlog of
emails and links, and am really exhausted now,

could I ask a volunteer to post this domhoff quote on our blog, perhaps with
the previous quote that paul mentioned, from the same author, just before?

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Fresh Start For the Left: What Activists Would Do If They Took the Social
</I>&gt;<i> Sciences Seriously&quot; by G. William Domhoff
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_freshstart.html">http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_freshstart.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> #6. Redefining Who Is Us and Who Is Them
</I>&gt;<i>  Social scientists have done a great many studies documenting the
</I>&gt;<i> inequalities and injustices of the class-based social structure of the
</I>&gt;<i> United States. However, the evidence for class domination and extreme
</I>&gt;<i> inequality doesn't mean that it makes good political sense to frame
</I>&gt;<i> political conflict primarily in terms of one economic class against another
</I>&gt;<i> in trying to bring about egalitarian social change. It tends to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> political struggles to economic issues, and to create problems of defining
</I>&gt;<i> who is us and who is them that have led to endless arguments about who is a
</I>&gt;<i> worker, who is a petite bourgeois, and who is a capitalist.
</I>&gt;<i>  If the problem is developing new policies and gaining political power,
</I>&gt;<i> which it is, then the struggle should be framed from the start as a conflict
</I>&gt;<i> over power and values, not as a struggle between social classes. The
</I>&gt;<i> in-group should be all those who come to embrace the program of the
</I>&gt;<i> egalitarian movement, and the out-group should be all those who oppose such
</I>&gt;<i> changes. If the conflict is framed in this way, an egalitarian coalition has
</I>&gt;<i> a chance to win over the moderates, neutrals, and independents who currently
</I>&gt;<i> identify with capitalists, and who might be offended by blanket criticisms
</I>&gt;<i> of them as a class. It may even attract dissident members of the capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> class who transcend their class interests, and in the process become very
</I>&gt;<i> valuable in legitimating the movement to those in the middle who are
</I>&gt;<i> hesitant to climb on board.
</I>&gt;<i>  But a class framing is not just a problem in terms of labeling all
</I>&gt;<i> capitalists as enemies. Once the conflict is framed in class terms, those
</I>&gt;<i> defined as members of the working class take on all virtue, and those
</I>&gt;<i> outside the working class are ignored or demonized, whether they are rich or
</I>&gt;<i> not. In fact, it is very difficult to decide who is in the working class and
</I>&gt;<i> who is not, which leads to further problems for the movement. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> those who are neither capitalists nor workers are sometimes called the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;petty&quot; bourgeois, which in theory means those who own their own means of
</I>&gt;<i> production but do not exploit the labor of others, but in practice ends up
</I>&gt;<i> meaning those people who are believed to be potential right wingers, a
</I>&gt;<i> demonization which almost guarantees that they will become enemies of the
</I>&gt;<i> left whether they started out that way or not.
</I>&gt;<i>  Doing politics in terms of class categories also make little sense because
</I>&gt;<i> it does not sit well with most of the everyday working people to whom it is
</I>&gt;<i> meant to appeal. The whole thrust of the average Americans' experience is to
</I>&gt;<i> break down class distinctions, not heighten them. They do not like to think
</I>&gt;<i> of themselves in terms of their class situation, which immediately reminds
</I>&gt;<i> them that they are not rich and have a lower status than they might like.
</I>&gt;<i> Americans never have liked the idea of class, and this is not simply a
</I>&gt;<i> denial of reality or the product of ideological hype. It is a matter of what
</I>&gt;<i> social identities people prefer to emphasize, which in the United States
</I>&gt;<i> have not included class for a variety of historical reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>  Most Americans below the wealthy and professional classes understand that
</I>&gt;<i> they have differing interests from the upper levels when it comes to wages,
</I>&gt;<i> working conditions, taxes, and government benefits. Poll after poll shows
</I>&gt;<i> that they would like to see their own interests realized, but not by
</I>&gt;<i> defining one class against the other. It therefore makes no psychological or
</I>&gt;<i> political sense to try to impose a class identity on people just because
</I>&gt;<i> there's a social structure out there or some theory says it's a good idea to
</I>&gt;<i> do politics in class terms.
</I>&gt;<i>  In addition, a class framing is problematic because many egalitarians who
</I>&gt;<i> agitate for social change do not come from the working class, however
</I>&gt;<i> broadly it is defined, which makes them look like they are practicing a form
</I>&gt;<i> of noblesse oblige. They often come from professional or wealthy families,
</I>&gt;<i> obtain good educational credentials, and find work in or around university
</I>&gt;<i> settings. Rather than claiming that they speak in the name of the working
</I>&gt;<i> class, which rings hollow with most blue-collar and white-collar workers,
</I>&gt;<i> they should put forth a program based on planning through the market that
</I>&gt;<i> alters the class structure, and then try to develop a value-based coalition
</I>&gt;<i> that includes everyone willing to support it.
</I>&gt;<i>  The ideal model for a more open-ended framing of a social conflict is
</I>&gt;<i> provided by the civil rights movement, which refused to define &quot;whites&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> the enemy, but only &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;bigots.&quot; Racists and bigots included most
</I>&gt;<i> whites in the South at that time, of course, so there was a clear opposition
</I>&gt;<i> out there, but at the same time there was room for pro-integration whites.
</I>&gt;<i> Drawing on the Christian tradition, the movement therefore was able to
</I>&gt;<i> utilize the concepts of forgiveness, redemption and conversion in the
</I>&gt;<i> service of strategic nonviolence to forge a black-white coalition. By
</I>&gt;<i> opening its doors to people who believed in equal rights for
</I>&gt;<i> African-Americans whatever their class, race, religion, or previous beliefs,
</I>&gt;<i> the movement was able to use these concepts to make it permissible for
</I>&gt;<i> people to change their attitudes without violating their self-images as
</I>&gt;<i> decent people (&quot;saving face&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>  This strategy also had great appeal because it made sense to the many
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;third parties&quot; -- bystanders and observers -- outside the South who were
</I>&gt;<i> witnesses to the struggle. In similar fashion, if a &quot;cross-class&quot; coalition
</I>&gt;<i> is going to be necessary to assemble a majority for an egalitarian program
</I>&gt;<i> in the twenty-first century, then it is better to begin with a political
</I>&gt;<i> framing of the Us vs. Them issue that does not define one class or another
</I>&gt;<i> as the enemy.
</I>&gt;<i>  This approach to social change receives strong support from a long
</I>&gt;<i> tradition of experimental studies of in-groups and out-groups in social
</I>&gt;<i> psychology. First, studies of in-groups and out-groups show how readily
</I>&gt;<i> people create such categories, even when the basis for distinctions are few
</I>&gt;<i> and minor, probably because being part of an in-group reduces social
</I>&gt;<i> uncertainty, enhances self-esteem, and satisfies psychological needs for a
</I>&gt;<i> sense of belonging and identity. Such studies also reveal how quickly people
</I>&gt;<i> invest strong emotional energy in the categories, feeling positive toward
</I>&gt;<i> those they define as in their group and, with the wrong kind of
</I>&gt;<i> encouragement, highly negative toward those in the out-group. It is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> quite easy to become extremely antagonistic toward opponents due to this
</I>&gt;<i> form of thinking, which is why who is us and who is them has to be defined
</I>&gt;<i> very carefully from the start.
</I>&gt;<i>  At the same time, experimental studies by social psychologists show that
</I>&gt;<i> an Us v. Them framing is a powerful basis for a social movement. An in-group
</I>&gt;<i> definition provides a strong sense of solidarity. It makes possible social
</I>&gt;<i> comparisons with privileged exclusionary groups, which can generate a sense
</I>&gt;<i> of injustice and contribute to a willingness to act. The problem, then, is
</I>&gt;<i> to define the out-group in such a way that it is possible for people to
</I>&gt;<i> abandon this group and join the in-group. Thus, the out-group should not be
</I>&gt;<i> defined by characteristics that it cannot relinquish, such as gender, race,
</I>&gt;<i> ethnicity, sexual orientation, or class origins. So, how should the conflict
</I>&gt;<i> over transforming American society be framed by nonviolent egalitarian
</I>&gt;<i> activists?
</I>&gt;<i>  Given the changing social composition of the Democratic Party, and the
</I>&gt;<i> need to avoid a class framing of the in-group and the out-group, it is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;corporate-conservative coalition&quot; and the Republican Party that should be
</I>&gt;<i> the designated opponents of egalitarian activists. Indeed, they are the most
</I>&gt;<i> clear, vocal, and organized opposition to any form of progressive social
</I>&gt;<i> change, as evidenced by their economic and social policies since at least
</I>&gt;<i> the 1970s. Framing the general conflict in terms of egalitarians versus
</I>&gt;<i> corporate conservatives, and of Democrats versus Republicans in the
</I>&gt;<i> political arena, has two distinct advantages in addition to avoiding a
</I>&gt;<i> demonization of &quot;the rich&quot; or the capitalist class.
</I>&gt;<i>  First, these are categories from which people can remove themselves. They
</I>&gt;<i> can change their minds and become Democrats, as many former Republicans in
</I>&gt;<i> the Northeast already have done over the past 35 years. Second, these
</I>&gt;<i> categories leave a great many people as &quot;third parties&quot; who do not feel
</I>&gt;<i> labeled as enemies and put on the defensive by criticisms of the
</I>&gt;<i> corporate-conservative coalition and the Republican Party. In exit polls in
</I>&gt;<i> 2004, 37% of the respondents identified themselves as Republicans, 37% as
</I>&gt;<i> Democrats, and 26% as Independents. At the same time, 34% said they are
</I>&gt;<i> conservatives, 45% said they are moderates, and 21% said they are liberals.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, a focus on the corporate-conservative coalition and the Republicans as
</I>&gt;<i> the opposition leaves egalitarians with a potential majority of liberals,
</I>&gt;<i> moderates, independents, and Democrats to win to their side.
</I>&gt;<i>  But who is the egalitarian &quot;we&quot; who do battle with the
</I>&gt;<i> corporate-conservative coalition if it is not &quot;the working class?&quot; It starts
</I>&gt;<i> with the multiple we's who currently make up the nonviolent insurgent groups
</I>&gt;<i> in the United States, the coalition of white progressives, liberal people of
</I>&gt;<i> color, progressive trade unionists, feminists, living-wage activists,
</I>&gt;<i> environmentalists, gay-lesbian activists, global justice and anti-war
</I>&gt;<i> activists, and anti-sweatshop activists who work together on many issues.
</I>&gt;<i> From there the coalition has to build out to the neutrals, bystanders,
</I>&gt;<i> moderates, and skeptics who are the majority at the present time. Within
</I>&gt;<i> this context, the movement has to offer everyone a shared common political
</I>&gt;<i> identity -- &quot;egalitarian Democrat&quot; -- that does not attempt to downplay or
</I>&gt;<i> erase their current social identities. It should be possible to be a
</I>&gt;<i> feminist and an egalitarian Democrat, or a gay activist and an egalitarian
</I>&gt;<i> Democrat, without feeling any sense of competition or contradiction among
</I>&gt;<i> social identities.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, is it egalitarian decentralist peerists versus inequalitarian
</I>&gt;<i> centralized hierarchicalists? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, still, I like Manuel de Landa's idea of a Meshwork/Hierarchy
</I>&gt;<i> balance, so maybe it should be egalitarian balanceists versus peripheral
</I>&gt;<i> extremists? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, just trying a few terms. No doubt others here could do better. And
</I>&gt;<i> we might not even agree on what these should be, because they do depend in
</I>&gt;<i> part on perspectives and emphasis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the above is framed in terms of US politics, but no doubt these
</I>&gt;<i> same trends apply to varying degrees globally.
