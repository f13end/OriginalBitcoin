</I>&gt;<i> Peeropoly: The boardgame of abundance, prosperity, and plenty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After attending enough conferences and watching the eyes of venture  
</I>&gt;<i> capitalists and other investors glaze over at the mention of Open  
</I>&gt;<i> Source applied to biotechnology, it was clearly time to devise a  
</I>&gt;<i> teaching tool to explain the economics of sharing nicely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best way is to create a game so simple even a child, or a VC,  
</I>&gt;<i> could understand! This project, to distill the essence of Peer  
</I>&gt;<i> Production into an abstract set of rules, sharpens our own  
</I>&gt;<i> understanding and forces us to convey the ideas clearly and  
</I>&gt;<i> compellingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> History: The world&#8217;s most popular board game, the aptly and as we wi 
</I>&gt;<i> ll see ironically named Monopoly, was, as it turns out, also origina 
</I>&gt;<i> lly devised as a teaching tool. In 1974, Ralph Anspach invented the  
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-Monopoly game. The incredible story of his decade long legal ba 
</I>&gt;<i> ttle with Parker Brothers, a battle in which he uncovered the truth  
</I>&gt;<i> about the history of Monopoly, that the game itself was an unfair mo 
</I>&gt;<i> nopoly, stolen from an earlier game invented by Quakers and in the p 
</I>&gt;<i> ublic domain for years, is summarized at <A HREF="http://www.antimonopoly.com/.">http://www.antimonopoly.com/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His riveting book, The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is highly recommended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concept: Just as the original Monopoly predecessor, called the  
</I>&gt;<i> Landlord&#8217;s Game and Prosperity, was intended to teach economics, nam 
</I>&gt;<i> ely Henry George&#8217;s theory of the single tax on unearned rent from ap 
</I>&gt;<i> preciation of land values that the landlord effortlessly and thus un 
</I>&gt;<i> justly captured, Peeropoly will teach the emerging economics of Peer 
</I>&gt;<i>  Production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At heart, Monopoly is supposed to be a satire of the excesses of  
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism. Players are supposed to understand that the winner is  
</I>&gt;<i> the &#8220;most successful villain.&#8221; In practice, the game has led to  
</I>&gt;<i> an unintended glorification of monopoly. To correct this, Maggie Phi 
</I>&gt;<i> llips, inventor of the first landlord&#8217;s game, created another called 
</I>&gt;<i>  the Landlord&#8217;s Game and Prosperity. The key innovation was the the  
</I>&gt;<i> choice to vote to change the rules of play by majority consensus at  
</I>&gt;<i> any time during play. Once the players learned that the first rule s 
</I>&gt;<i> et, the standard winner take all game, made one player rich but impo 
</I>&gt;<i> verished the rest, they would logically vote to play under the secon 
</I>&gt;<i> d set, in which all unearned gains were redistributed to the communi 
</I>&gt;<i> ty. This was not anti-capitalist, players still kept income from hou 
</I>&gt;<i> ses or improvements they made on the land, just not from the title i 
</I>&gt;<i> tself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Anspach&#8217;s Anti-Monopoly game went through several versions. Orig 
</I>&gt;<i> inally he created a game whose theme was to &#8220;bust the trust.&#8221; The  
</I>&gt;<i> board started out in the hands of monopolists and the goal was to br 
</I>&gt;<i> eak up ownership and create true free enterprise. Later, he modified 
</I>&gt;<i>  the game so that players start in the normal Monopoly way, but can  
</I>&gt;<i> play as monopolists or competitors, illustrating the difference betw 
</I>&gt;<i> een a free market and a monopoly in real estate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plan: The design process will itself be an instance of peer  
</I>&gt;<i> production. Our game will draw on the previous concepts from the  
</I>&gt;<i> Landlord&#8217;s game and Anti-Monopoly. We imagine a game in which player 
</I>&gt;<i> s compete and cooperate to develop natural/energy, scientific, and c 
</I>&gt;<i> ultural resources. Players can adopt a monopolist or a peer strategy 
</I>&gt;<i> . They will acquire intellectual property certificates over resource 
</I>&gt;<i> s such as the human genome, the broadcast spectrum, oil sites, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The following rules are speculative at this point: just  
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming. There are many things to work out depending on how we  
</I>&gt;<i> devise the victory conditions. The Landlord&#8217;s game ended when the po 
</I>&gt;<i> orest player obtained twice as much money as had been distributed to 
</I>&gt;<i>  the individual players at the beginning, thus illustrating that pro 
</I>&gt;<i> sperity had been achieved. The main fun of Monopoly is the ruthless  
</I>&gt;<i> 0 sum drive to destroy your opponents. We have to figure out how to  
</I>&gt;<i> capture this excitement in the context of rules that demonstrate the 
</I>&gt;<i>  virtues of sharing nicely. Essentially the game must show that whil 
</I>&gt;<i> e monopoly is good for the monopolists, it is very unstable and dang 
</I>&gt;<i> erous for us all. Thus, game events such as oil shocks, avian flu, o 
</I>&gt;<i> r crop devastation because of a monoculture&#8217;s vulnerability to pests 
</I>&gt;<i> /pathogens, will demonstrate the danger of monopoly. Some way to mea 
</I>&gt;<i> sure the player who creates the most wealth (is responsible for the  
</I>&gt;<i> most development) rather than acquires the most, would be ideal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you land on a space controlled by a monopolist you must pay rent  
</I>&gt;<i> unless you try to infringe, at which point you &#8220;go to court&#8221; and  
</I>&gt;<i> just like in real life, essentially &#8220;roll the dice&#8221; to determine  
</I>&gt;<i> the outcome. If the monopolist doesn&#8217;t like the outcome, they can pa 
</I>&gt;<i> y more and roll again&#8211;just like in real life where he who hires the  
</I>&gt;<i> most lawyers usually wins. These legal battles can quickly cost a lo 
</I>&gt;<i> t, meaning that players will typically just pay the tax/rent. If a m 
</I>&gt;<i> onopoly is found invalid, the property is back in the public domain  
</I>&gt;<i> and open for development under a Peer strategy. Monopolists will pay 
</I>&gt;<i>  dearly to preserve control as each monopoly property pays large amo 
</I>&gt;<i> unts of rent while a Peer owned property simply generates a modest a 
</I>&gt;<i> mount of income per turn. However, Peers do not pay rent to one anot 
</I>&gt;<i> her, and can benefit from improving their properties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously we could quickly make a game that is too complicated which  
</I>&gt;<i> defeats the purpose. Thus we are soliciting many ideas in the forums  
</I>&gt;<i> and will narrow it down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seeking: a core dedicated team of rule designers and testers is  
</I>&gt;<i> needed. When the rules have been devised they need to be balanced  
</I>&gt;<i> and play tested. This can be done by having a computer play the game  
</I>&gt;<i> a few thousand times. There is actually quite a lot of probability  
</I>&gt;<i> work involved in the original game as to which squares are most  
</I>&gt;<i> often landed on and thus most valuable to own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also need someone with artistic ability. There is a make your own 
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8220;opoly&#8221; kit that can be a starting point. <A HREF="http://www.tdcgames.com/MYO">http://www.tdcgames.com/MYO</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> .htm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also a Microsoft satire game, called micropoly is at micropoly.com.  
</I>&gt;<i> The project does not seem to be active but there is some material to  
</I>&gt;<i> download and examine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, we need some programmers on the team as it makes sense to  
</I>&gt;<i> build a computer version of the game both for testing purposes and  
</I>&gt;<i> eventual release with the prototype for a board game.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Joseph
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have attached a short doc that gives an overview of what we are  
</I>&gt;<i> trying
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish with the design including the method of play.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you and your partners have reviewed and hopefully approved the
</I>&gt;<i> approach we will refine the concept, produce simple test copies and
</I>&gt;<i> proceed with the initial testing process. Yes and of course bill  
</I>&gt;<i> you. If
</I>&gt;<i> you have any trepidation to the direction we are taking now would be  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> time to bring it up, as re-starting later will be time consuming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will be visiting and exhibiter at GenCon in two weeks that has a PoD
</I>&gt;<i> game production business. They would be able to produce small  
</I>&gt;<i> numbers of
</I>&gt;<i> games at a reasonable price to use in outreach. This would be a  
</I>&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;<i> option incase your plan to produce copies for the general population
</I>&gt;<i> changes and you still want to follow through with the original  
</I>&gt;<i> educational
</I>&gt;<i> concept alone. Right now I know they have the capability to make Peer
</I>&gt;<i> Poker yet I have not seen their products first hand. Quality is  
</I>&gt;<i> always an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with PoD producers so I&#8217;ll let you know what you&#8217;ll get for  
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> money.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposed Peer Poker Design
</I>&gt;<i> The authors were approached to create a board game that the clients  
</I>&gt;<i> can use in business seminar and workshop settings to demonstrate the  
</I>&gt;<i> relative advantages of different business entities working together  
</I>&gt;<i> rather than in strict competition. Ideally, the game will be  
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward to learn, yet provide the players meaningful choices  
</I>&gt;<i> that, at least on an abstract level, show how shared resources can  
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes be more beneficial to every stakeholder than would be  
</I>&gt;<i> possible individually. Since the potential real life applications  
</I>&gt;<i> are widely varied (e.g., open source software libraries, shared  
</I>&gt;<i> production lines, published biotechnology research, group health  
</I>&gt;<i> care, etc.), the in-game components should be kept relatively  
</I>&gt;<i> generic, at least during the initial development. This way, the  
</I>&gt;<i> clients can use the same game with groups in a variety of industries  
</I>&gt;<i> or, if desirable, customize certain thematic details in derivative  
</I>&gt;<i> works for use within individual target industries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most seminars and workshops are likely to be held in group settings,  
</I>&gt;<i> so the authors will work to create a game that scales well with  
</I>&gt;<i> three to eight players. In larger group settings, the facilitators  
</I>&gt;<i> can divide the participants into teams that need not be equal (to  
</I>&gt;<i> simulate smaller and larger entities within the industry or other  
</I>&gt;<i> customized scenarios). Playing time should be under two hours, and  
</I>&gt;<i> enjoyable enough to keep the primary target demographic (investors,  
</I>&gt;<i> executives and decision makers who value their time) interested and  
</I>&gt;<i> engaged. In addition, the game will be tailored to also appeal to  
</I>&gt;<i> wide demographic (such as families), because larger print runs would  
</I>&gt;<i> greatly reduce per unit production cost allowing for a financial  
</I>&gt;<i> return  in addition to the game's instructive benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expected Components
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paper Money (enough to have a working but limited in-game economy,  
</I>&gt;<i> in a realistic size for easier handling)
</I>&gt;<i> Loan Documents (notes in one or two denominations for simplicity,  
</I>&gt;<i> and similar in size to the paper money)
</I>&gt;<i> Markers (winks, chips or cubes) in eight colors (probably eight of  
</I>&gt;<i> each, to represent the entities' claims on projects)
</I>&gt;<i> Cards (probably around 100, representing combinations of resources  
</I>&gt;<i> such as ideas, talent, experience, research, equipment, technology,  
</I>&gt;<i> popular or political support, etc. over a range of values and costs)
</I>&gt;<i> Board (with spaces for cards and markers to keep track of developing  
</I>&gt;<i> and completed projects and claims, to help determine returns on  
</I>&gt;<i> investments when projects are completed, to give bonuses or exact  
</I>&gt;<i> penalties for investing in certain areas and so on)
</I>&gt;<i> Rules
</I>&gt;<i> Box Inserts and/or Zipper Bags (for keeping components tidy)
</I>&gt;<i> Box
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brief Description of Play
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Game play will feature a mix of competition and cooperation. Players  
</I>&gt;<i> (or teams) representing investors and/or company decision makers  
</I>&gt;<i> will take turns using money to pay for a limited number of actions.  
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the possible actions include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Purchase a card from a shuffled deck into your hand
</I>&gt;<i> Play a card from your hand onto the board to open, advance or close  
</I>&gt;<i> projects
</I>&gt;<i> Replace an existing card on the board to improve your own projects  
</I>&gt;<i> (or possibly sabotage a competing project)
</I>&gt;<i> Invest in or claim exclusive rights to resources and/or projects
</I>&gt;<i> Pay royalties to use resources owned by others
</I>&gt;<i> Repay loans (whether to a bank or to other players)
</I>&gt;<i> Release exclusive claims (doesn't cost money, but may be used in  
</I>&gt;<i> negotiations or to retrieve a marker for future use elsewhere)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Projects close when all the spaces representing that project are  
</I>&gt;<i> filled with cards, and the closure of the second projects represents  
</I>&gt;<i> reaching a deadline. At that point, all projects in a given area  
</I>&gt;<i> become due, whether completed or not, and returns on investment and  
</I>&gt;<i> losses are determined according to how they compare. A system  
</I>&gt;<i> roughly comparable to Poker is used to evaluate project rankings at  
</I>&gt;<i> the deadline. Projects can outshine one another by having better  
</I>&gt;<i> attributes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More valuable resources (like higher cards in Poker)
</I>&gt;<i> Synergy due to resources of matching value working well together  
</I>&gt;<i> (like two, three, four or five cards of the same value in different  
</I>&gt;<i> types of resource)
</I>&gt;<i> Clear progression (like straights)
</I>&gt;<i> Strength in a particular area (like flushes)
</I>&gt;<i> Combining two or more of the above (like straight flushes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Players may negotiate with one another about where or how to  
</I>&gt;<i> strategically invest in projects, loan money to one another, form  
</I>&gt;<i> alliances, make claims, and release rights. But since cards held in  
</I>&gt;<i> hands represent potential resources and technology that do not yet  
</I>&gt;<i> exist, the contents of players' hands may not be revealed to each  
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the projects that came due, returns on investments are  
</I>&gt;<i> determined by consulting a simple look-up table in the rules. Then,  
</I>&gt;<i> the best project takes the largest share of the returns on the  
</I>&gt;<i> investments, and the second best takes some smaller share. Under  
</I>&gt;<i> performing projects get nothing. Returns or costs are shared  
</I>&gt;<i> proportionally among the stakeholders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Example: Player A has exclusive rights to both the best and the  
</I>&gt;<i> second best projects. All of the returns from these projects go to  
</I>&gt;<i> Player A.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Example: Players A, B and D are invested 50%, 25% and 25%,  
</I>&gt;<i> respectively in the best project. Player A gets half of the best  
</I>&gt;<i> project returns, and players B and D each get half the remainder.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Example: Player C has exclusive rights to a project that does not  
</I>&gt;<i> pay off at the deadline. Player C gets no money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After investment returns are paid, the resources from the two  
</I>&gt;<i> projects that closed (even if they were not among the highest  
</I>&gt;<i> ranked) are removed from the board. Markers  are either returned to  
</I>&gt;<i> their owners or transferred to other projects depending upon where  
</I>&gt;<i> they were on the board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As in the real business world, success is measured by how well each  
</I>&gt;<i> player or team uses their money and resources to generate more  
</I>&gt;<i> money. At the end of the game, players or teams are ranked based  
</I>&gt;<i> upon how well they did with what they had. Any positive return is  
</I>&gt;<i> good, but more is obviously better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smari:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot; Have finally made it through the Peer Poker proposal, and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> very lacking. It makes certain structural assumptions that I think  
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> readily apply within the P2P or open source contexts. The fact that
</I>&gt;<i> loans, claims and rights are built seems a bit weird.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  An alternative proposal... I've played a number of roleplaying and
</I>&gt;<i> tabletop board games in my time so I can see how this kind of game
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic might play out, but it's just a thought that came to me as I  
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> reading the other proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Each player represents a village. The village has a size on the scale
</I>&gt;<i> from 1-20. Depending on the size of the village they have a certain
</I>&gt;<i> amount of time resource units that can be allocated and reallocated  
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> turn. These can be traded between players, but the total number in  
</I>&gt;<i> play
</I>&gt;<i> is always the sum of the sizes of all the villages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  At the beginning of each turn players draw cards from a deck. The
</I>&gt;<i> cards have three types: Resources, events, and technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A resource needs time units allocated to it in order be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Events can be good or bad, and represent the will of the villagers,
</I>&gt;<i> natural disasters, political situations or changes in prosperity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Technologies need to be put into play in order to be used. When
</I>&gt;<i> they're put into play they can be put into the player's area, granting
</I>&gt;<i> him a monopoly over the technology, or into the commons, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> everybody to use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Here's where it gets interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Each village has a needs card with tokens on it. There are six bars
</I>&gt;<i> representing six measures of prosperity: Exposure (too hot, too cold),
</I>&gt;<i> hunger, thirst, injury/illness, luxury and happiness. Each bar has  
</I>&gt;<i> five
</I>&gt;<i> places on it (see attachment) - hereafter known as Very High, High,
</I>&gt;<i> Adequate, Low and Very Low. At the beginning of the game each player  
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> tokens on all the middle row... and five cards on hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Now consider a game:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Player 1 has five cards on hand:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        - Technology: Irrigation
