<PRE>Dear Joseph,

This is a fantastic and very important initiative ...

unfortunately, it's not really my thing, I have little fantasy for these
type of things, so forgive me if I'm not very active in contributing, but I
really hope others do ..

I think it would also benefit from some real-time brainstorming ...

Feel free to also publish your appeal on the ning forum, and also to
announce it on the regular blog

Michel

</I>&gt;<i> Peeropoly: The boardgame of abundance, prosperity, and plenty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After attending enough conferences and watching the eyes of venture
</I>&gt;<i> capitalists and other investors glaze over at the mention of Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> applied to biotechnology, it was clearly time to devise a teaching tool to
</I>&gt;<i> explain the economics of sharing nicely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best way is to create a game so simple even a child, or a VC, could
</I>&gt;<i> understand! This project, to distill the essence of Peer Production into an
</I>&gt;<i> abstract set of rules, sharpens our own understanding and forces us to
</I>&gt;<i> convey the ideas clearly and compellingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> History: The world&#8217;s most popular board game, the aptly and as we will see
</I>&gt;<i> ironically named Monopoly, was, as it turns out, also originally devised as
</I>&gt;<i> a teaching tool. In 1974, Ralph Anspach invented the Anti-Monopoly game. The
</I>&gt;<i> incredible story of his decade long legal battle with Parker Brothers, a
</I>&gt;<i> battle in which he uncovered the truth about the history of Monopoly, that
</I>&gt;<i> the game itself was an unfair monopoly, stolen from an earlier game invented
</I>&gt;<i> by Quakers and in the public domain for years, is summarized at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antimonopoly.com/.">http://www.antimonopoly.com/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His riveting book, The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Billion-Dollar-Monopoly-Swindle/dp/0738831395/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210289635&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Billion-Dollar-Monopoly-Swindle/dp/0738831395/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210289635&amp;sr=8-1</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is highly recommended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concept: Just as the original Monopoly predecessor, called the Landlord&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> Game and Prosperity, was intended to teach economics, namely Henry George&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> theory of the single tax on unearned rent from appreciation of land values
</I>&gt;<i> that the landlord effortlessly and thus unjustly captured, Peeropoly will
</I>&gt;<i> teach the emerging economics of Peer Production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At heart, Monopoly is supposed to be a satire of the excesses of
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism. Players are supposed to understand that the winner is the &#8220;most
</I>&gt;<i> successful villain.&#8221; In practice, the game has led to an unintended
</I>&gt;<i> glorification of monopoly. To correct this, Maggie Phillips, inventor of the
</I>&gt;<i> first landlord&#8217;s game, created another called the Landlord&#8217;s Game and
</I>&gt;<i> Prosperity. The key innovation was the the choice to vote to change the
</I>&gt;<i> rules of play by majority consensus at any time during play. Once the
</I>&gt;<i> players learned that the first rule set, the standard winner take all game,
</I>&gt;<i> made one player rich but impoverished the rest, they would logically vote to
</I>&gt;<i> play under the second set, in which all unearned gains were redistributed to
</I>&gt;<i> the community. This was not anti-capitalist, players still kept income from
</I>&gt;<i> houses or improvements they made on the land, just not from the title
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Anspach&#8217;s Anti-Monopoly game went through several versions. Originally
</I>&gt;<i> he created a game whose theme was to &#8220;bust the trust.&#8221; The board started out
</I>&gt;<i> in the hands of monopolists and the goal was to break up ownership and
</I>&gt;<i> create true free enterprise. Later, he modified the game so that players
</I>&gt;<i> start in the normal Monopoly way, but can play as monopolists or
</I>&gt;<i> competitors, illustrating the difference between a free market and a
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly in real estate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plan: The design process will itself be an instance of peer production. Our
</I>&gt;<i> game will draw on the previous concepts from the Landlord&#8217;s game and
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-Monopoly. We imagine a game in which players compete and cooperate to
</I>&gt;<i> develop natural/energy, scientific, and cultural resources. Players can
</I>&gt;<i> adopt a monopolist or a peer strategy. They will acquire intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> property certificates over resources such as the human genome, the broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum, oil sites, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The following rules are speculative at this point: just brainstorming.
</I>&gt;<i> There are many things to work out depending on how we devise the victory
</I>&gt;<i> conditions. The Landlord&#8217;s game ended when the poorest player obtained twice
</I>&gt;<i> as much money as had been distributed to the individual players at the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, thus illustrating that prosperity had been achieved. The main fun
</I>&gt;<i> of Monopoly is the ruthless 0 sum drive to destroy your opponents. We have
</I>&gt;<i> to figure out how to capture this excitement in the context of rules that
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrate the virtues of sharing nicely. Essentially the game must show
</I>&gt;<i> that while monopoly is good for the monopolists, it is very unstable and
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous for us all. Thus, game events such as oil shocks, avian flu, or
</I>&gt;<i> crop devastation because of a monoculture&#8217;s vulnerability to
</I>&gt;<i> pests/pathogens, will demonstrate the danger of monopoly. Some way to
</I>&gt;<i> measure the player who creates the most wealth (is responsible for the most
</I>&gt;<i> development) rather than acquires the most, would be ideal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you land on a space controlled by a monopolist you must pay rent unless
</I>&gt;<i> you try to infringe, at which point you &#8220;go to court&#8221; and just like in real
</I>&gt;<i> life, essentially &#8220;roll the dice&#8221; to determine the outcome. If the
</I>&gt;<i> monopolist doesn&#8217;t like the outcome, they can pay more and roll again&#8211;just
</I>&gt;<i> like in real life where he who hires the most lawyers usually wins. These
</I>&gt;<i> legal battles can quickly cost a lot, meaning that players will typically
</I>&gt;<i> just pay the tax/rent. If a monopoly is found invalid, the property is back
</I>&gt;<i> in the public domain and open for development under a Peer strategy.
</I>&gt;<i> Monopolists will pay dearly to preserve control as each monopoly property
</I>&gt;<i> pays large amounts of rent while a Peer owned property simply generates a
</I>&gt;<i> modest amount of income per turn. However, Peers do not pay rent to one
</I>&gt;<i> another, and can benefit from improving their properties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously we could quickly make a game that is too complicated which
</I>&gt;<i> defeats the purpose. Thus we are soliciting many ideas in the forums and
</I>&gt;<i> will narrow it down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seeking: a core dedicated team of rule designers and testers is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> When the rules have been devised they need to be balanced and play tested.
</I>&gt;<i> This can be done by having a computer play the game a few thousand times.
</I>&gt;<i> There is actually quite a lot of probability work involved in the original
</I>&gt;<i> game as to which squares are most often landed on and thus most valuable to
</I>&gt;<i> own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also need someone with artistic ability. There is a make your own
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;opoly&#8221; kit that can be a starting point. <A HREF="http://www.tdcgames.com/MYO.htm">http://www.tdcgames.com/MYO.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also a Microsoft satire game, called micropoly is at micropoly.com&lt;<A HREF="http://www.micropoly.com/">http://www.micropoly.com/</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> The project does not seem to be active but there is some material to
</I>&gt;<i> download and examine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, we need some programmers on the team as it makes sense to build a
</I>&gt;<i> computer version of the game both for testing purposes and eventual release
</I>&gt;<i> with the prototype for a board game.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Joseph
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have attached a short doc that gives an overview of what we are trying
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish with the design including the method of play.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you and your partners have reviewed and hopefully approved the
</I>&gt;<i> approach we will refine the concept, produce simple test copies and
</I>&gt;<i> proceed with the initial testing process. Yes and of course bill you. If
</I>&gt;<i> you have any trepidation to the direction we are taking now would be the
</I>&gt;<i> time to bring it up, as re-starting later will be time consuming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will be visiting and exhibiter at GenCon in two weeks that has a PoD
</I>&gt;<i> game production business. They would be able to produce small numbers of
</I>&gt;<i> games at a reasonable price to use in outreach. This would be a possible
</I>&gt;<i> option incase your plan to produce copies for the general population
</I>&gt;<i> changes and you still want to follow through with the original educational
</I>&gt;<i> concept alone. Right now I know they have the capability to make Peer
</I>&gt;<i> Poker yet I have not seen their products first hand. Quality is always an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with PoD producers so I&#8217;ll let you know what you&#8217;ll get for your
</I>&gt;<i> money.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposed Peer Poker Design
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The authors were approached to create a board game that the clients can use
</I>&gt;<i> in business seminar and workshop settings to demonstrate the relative
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of different business entities working together rather than in
</I>&gt;<i> strict competition. Ideally, the game will be straightforward to learn, yet
</I>&gt;<i> provide the players meaningful choices that, at least on an abstract level,
</I>&gt;<i> show how shared resources can sometimes be more beneficial to every
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder than would be possible individually. Since the potential real
</I>&gt;<i> life applications are widely varied (e.g., open source software libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> shared production lines, published biotechnology research, group health
</I>&gt;<i> care, etc.), the in-game components should be kept relatively generic, at
</I>&gt;<i> least during the initial development. This way, the clients can use the same
</I>&gt;<i> game with groups in a variety of industries or, if desirable, customize
</I>&gt;<i> certain thematic details in derivative works for use within individual
</I>&gt;<i> target industries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most seminars and workshops are likely to be held in group settings, so the
</I>&gt;<i> authors will work to create a game that scales well with three to eight
</I>&gt;<i> players. In larger group settings, the facilitators can divide the
</I>&gt;<i> participants into teams that need not be equal (to simulate smaller and
</I>&gt;<i> larger entities within the industry or other customized scenarios). Playing
</I>&gt;<i> time should be under two hours, and enjoyable enough to keep the primary
</I>&gt;<i> target demographic (investors, executives and decision makers who value
</I>&gt;<i> their time) interested and engaged. In addition, the game will be tailored
</I>&gt;<i> to also appeal to wide demographic (such as families), because larger print
</I>&gt;<i> runs would greatly reduce per unit production cost allowing for a financial
</I>&gt;<i> return in addition to the game's instructive benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expected Components
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Paper Money (enough to have a working but limited in-game economy, in
</I>&gt;<i>    a realistic size for easier handling)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Loan Documents (notes in one or two denominations for simplicity, and
</I>&gt;<i>    similar in size to the paper money)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Markers (winks, chips or cubes) in eight colors (probably eight of
</I>&gt;<i>    each, to represent the entities' claims on projects)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Cards (probably around 100, representing combinations of resources
</I>&gt;<i>    such as ideas, talent, experience, research, equipment, technology, popular
</I>&gt;<i>    or political support, etc. over a range of values and costs)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Board (with spaces for cards and markers to keep track of developing
</I>&gt;<i>    and completed projects and claims, to help determine returns on investments
</I>&gt;<i>    when projects are completed, to give bonuses or exact penalties for
</I>&gt;<i>    investing in certain areas and so on)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Rules
</I>&gt;<i>    - Box Inserts and/or Zipper Bags (for keeping components tidy)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Box
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brief Description of Play
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Game play will feature a mix of competition and cooperation. Players (or
</I>&gt;<i> teams) representing investors and/or company decision makers will take turns
</I>&gt;<i> using money to pay for a limited number of actions. Some of the possible
</I>&gt;<i> actions include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Purchase a card from a shuffled deck into your hand
</I>&gt;<i>    - Play a card from your hand onto the board to open, advance or close
</I>&gt;<i>    projects
</I>&gt;<i>    - Replace an existing card on the board to improve your own projects
</I>&gt;<i>    (or possibly sabotage a competing project)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Invest in or claim exclusive rights to resources and/or projects
</I>&gt;<i>    - Pay royalties to use resources owned by others
</I>&gt;<i>    - Repay loans (whether to a bank or to other players)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Release exclusive claims (doesn't cost money, but may be used in
</I>&gt;<i>    negotiations or to retrieve a marker for future use elsewhere)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Projects close when all the spaces representing that project are filled
</I>&gt;<i> with cards, and the closure of the second projects represents reaching a
</I>&gt;<i> deadline. At that point, all projects in a given area become due, whether
</I>&gt;<i> completed or not, and returns on investment and losses are determined
</I>&gt;<i> according to how they compare. A system roughly comparable to Poker is used
</I>&gt;<i> to evaluate project rankings at the deadline. Projects can outshine one
</I>&gt;<i> another by having better attributes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - More valuable resources (like higher cards in Poker)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Synergy due to resources of matching value working well together
</I>&gt;<i>    (like two, three, four or five cards of the same value in different types of
</I>&gt;<i>    resource)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Clear progression (like straights)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Strength in a particular area (like flushes)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Combining two or more of the above (like straight flushes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Players may negotiate with one another about where or how to strategically
</I>&gt;<i> invest in projects, loan money to one another, form alliances, make claims,
</I>&gt;<i> and release rights. But since cards held in hands represent potential
</I>&gt;<i> resources and technology that do not yet exist, the contents of players'
</I>&gt;<i> hands may not be revealed to each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the projects that came due, returns on investments are determined by
</I>&gt;<i> consulting a simple look-up table in the rules. Then, the best project takes
</I>&gt;<i> the largest share of the returns on the investments, and the second best
</I>&gt;<i> takes some smaller share. Under performing projects get nothing. Returns or
</I>&gt;<i> costs are shared proportionally among the stakeholders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Example: Player A has exclusive rights to both the best and the second
</I>&gt;<i> best projects. All of the returns from these projects go to Player A.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Example: Players A, B and D are invested 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively
</I>&gt;<i> in the best project. Player A gets half of the best project returns, and
</I>&gt;<i> players B and D each get half the remainder.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Example: Player C has exclusive rights to a project that does not pay
</I>&gt;<i> off at the deadline. Player C gets no money.
</I>&gt;<i> After investment returns are paid, the resources from the two projects that
</I>&gt;<i> closed (even if they were not among the highest ranked) are removed from the
</I>&gt;<i> board. Markers are either returned to their owners or transferred to other
</I>&gt;<i> projects depending upon where they were on the board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As in the real business world, success is measured by how well each player
</I>&gt;<i> or team uses their money and resources to generate more money. At the end of
</I>&gt;<i> the game, players or teams are ranked based upon how well they did with what
</I>&gt;<i> they had. Any positive return is good, but more is obviously better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smari:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot; Have finally made it through the Peer Poker proposal, and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> very lacking. It makes certain structural assumptions that I think don't
</I>&gt;<i> readily apply within the P2P or open source contexts. The fact that
</I>&gt;<i> loans, claims and rights are built seems a bit weird.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  An alternative proposal... I've played a number of roleplaying and
</I>&gt;<i> tabletop board games in my time so I can see how this kind of game
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic might play out, but it's just a thought that came to me as I was
</I>&gt;<i> reading the other proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Each player represents a village. The village has a size on the scale
</I>&gt;<i> from 1-20. Depending on the size of the village they have a certain
</I>&gt;<i> amount of time resource units that can be allocated and reallocated each
</I>&gt;<i> turn. These can be traded between players, but the total number in play
</I>&gt;<i> is always the sum of the sizes of all the villages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  At the beginning of each turn players draw cards from a deck. The
</I>&gt;<i> cards have three types: Resources, events, and technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A resource needs time units allocated to it in order be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Events can be good or bad, and represent the will of the villagers,
</I>&gt;<i> natural disasters, political situations or changes in prosperity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Technologies need to be put into play in order to be used. When
</I>&gt;<i> they're put into play they can be put into the player's area, granting
</I>&gt;<i> him a monopoly over the technology, or into the commons, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> everybody to use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Here's where it gets interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Each village has a needs card with tokens on it. There are six bars
</I>&gt;<i> representing six measures of prosperity: Exposure (too hot, too cold),
</I>&gt;<i> hunger, thirst, injury/illness, luxury and happiness. Each bar has five
</I>&gt;<i> places on it (see attachment) - hereafter known as Very High, High,
</I>&gt;<i> Adequate, Low and Very Low. At the beginning of the game each player has
</I>&gt;<i> tokens on all the middle row... and five cards on hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Now consider a game:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Player 1 has five cards on hand:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        - Technology: Irrigation
</I>&gt;<i>                        - doubles food production in farms
</I>&gt;<i>        - Resource: Copper mine
</I>&gt;<i>                        - requires 5 labor
</I>&gt;<i>                        - provides +1 luxury
</I>&gt;<i>        - Technology: Genetics
</I>&gt;<i>                        - doubles health production from hospitals
</I>&gt;<i>        - Event: Drought
</I>&gt;<i>                        - -3 thirst to all players.
