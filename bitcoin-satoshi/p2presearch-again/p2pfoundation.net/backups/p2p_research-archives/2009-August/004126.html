</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is very very high level debate, as there is indeed panic about both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the havoc that the seesaw in oil and food prices is doing to the system as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this 'market' is so dysfunction that it literally threatens the survival
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the system itself, this is no wild leftist imaginings, but the thoughts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important members of the current establishment ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the pristine functions of the market you imagine are  nothing else than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and ideology,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I want to transcend the market, especially because I feel
</I>&gt;<i> (based on Alfie Kohn's work) that most competition is inherently
</I>&gt;<i> destructive, and that a means of production built mainly around competition
</I>&gt;<i> is in that sense a dumb idea. (Although, I can acknowledge a hybrid system
</I>&gt;<i> of some competition and lots of cooperation may have some merits.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason those prices are going crazy is in part the unchecked
</I>&gt;<i> centralization of wealth.  There are many trillions of dollars sloshing
</I>&gt;<i> around in global financial markets (no transaction tax) moving from
</I>&gt;<i> speculation to speculation and doing some of the damage you outline. It is
</I>&gt;<i> another systematic risk of markets, especially as the physical markets for
</I>&gt;<i> food and manufacturing are now being dwarfed by other markets for services
</I>&gt;<i> and finance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's one reason why, as long as we have markets, maybe we need *enormous*
</I>&gt;<i> taxes? Seriously. Maybe we need to go back to the 94% marginal tax rates the
</I>&gt;<i> USA had after WWII, and also lots of property taxes, as long as we have a
</I>&gt;<i> market, with the money going mostly back to the people as a basic income. If
</I>&gt;<i> people don't want taxes, then we need to reduce the role the market plays in
</I>&gt;<i> human affairs. Note, this is completely opposite to the current dominant
</I>&gt;<i> sentiment in the USA, but since the USA is going off a cliff economically,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe that just shows the popular sentiment for low taxes promoting growth
</I>&gt;<i> or societal happiness is a fallacy? Markets can't function well if wealth is
</I>&gt;<i> too concentrated; I've seen others (economists) say that, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> essentially what you are saying here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what we are seeing is a reflection of how easy it is to solve resource
</I>&gt;<i> problems because, essentially, they are so trivial that in one way, the
</I>&gt;<i> market doesn't care about them or take them seriously anymore. :-) For a
</I>&gt;<i> sign of how trivial these basic problem are, in the USA about 2% of the
</I>&gt;<i> workforce is involved with agriculture, and about 12% (and dropping fast)
</I>&gt;<i> with manufacturing (some imports happen too, granted). Anyway, clearly only
</I>&gt;<i> a fairly trivial amount of the workforce is involved with primary
</I>&gt;<i> productivity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And even there, much of what is produced (beef, snowmobiles) is of dubious
</I>&gt;<i> value. So, I'd guess we could support everyone in the USA with a good life
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly vegetarian) with maybe 3% of the workforce (plus maybe some more
</I>&gt;<i> (1%?) for core services like medicine, which could be more peer-ish given
</I>&gt;<i> the interenet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, all the rest of the economy is &quot;fluff&quot; in that sense, mostly about
</I>&gt;<i> guarding (like grocery store cashiers) or dealing with the negative
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of the Western diet. But, it is fluffy enough to hide the real
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. And that 94% of the economy we don't really need is the dog wagging
</I>&gt;<i> the tail is the really essential part of the economy. So, yes, I'll agree
</I>&gt;<i> that is a really dysfunctional situation. So, yes, I'll agree with those
</I>&gt;<i> others in that sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, that is obviously a &quot;market failure&quot;. So, the government needs to step
</I>&gt;<i> in with enormous taxes and redistribute those trillions of dollars of wealth
</I>&gt;<i> to make the market function again. Printing money is another way to have
</I>&gt;<i> such a tax via inflation, though who exactly gets hurt there is a tricky
</I>&gt;<i> subject. Or, if that is impossible politically, then I agree that people
</I>&gt;<i> need to create non-market alternatives, like a gift economy, a shared
</I>&gt;<i> commons of ideas and other resources, or local subsistence production, or
</I>&gt;<i> some mix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smart countries, like Singapore, see this, and even without much taxes,
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that core services like food production can continue to function for
</I>&gt;<i> national security reasons, which means interfering with the market somehow
</I>&gt;<i> (some interferences are worse than others, perhaps). Again, if so little of
</I>&gt;<i> the economy is really needed these days with all our modern technology to
</I>&gt;<i> supply food and other basics, it does not take much taxes to ensure the
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure is in place to produce them under any circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is only extreme free market fundamentalist places like the USA that are
</I>&gt;<i> at great risk of starvation and so on. It is both ironic, and
</I>&gt;<i> understandable, that a place like the USA so at the mercy of the free market
</I>&gt;<i> (grain supplies have been run down from years to days due to the Bush Admin
</I>&gt;<i> policies)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Lowest Food Supplies in 50 or 100 Years: Global Food Crisis Emerging&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5660.cfm">http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5660.cfm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> also spends the most on &quot;national security&quot;. That is because rather than an
</I>&gt;<i> *intrinsic* security of a well functioning infrastructure, the USA is
</I>&gt;<i> relying on *extrinsic* security of soldiers to defend an indefensible
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure for oil and food. So, we have &quot;Brittle Power&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_Power">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_Power</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, if the USA implodes, it has so many nuclear weapons and
</I>&gt;<i> plagues and such that it could take the rest of the world with it. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or as I said here:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  What am I up to with that PU education myself? Besides being a part-time
</I>&gt;<i> stay-at-home Dad, I'm busy these days in my &quot;free&quot; time (along with many in
</I>&gt;<i> the world, such as these people: <A HREF="http://www.reprap.org/">http://www.reprap.org/</A> :-) attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> help take down the intellectual scaffolding of global capitalism one myth at
</I>&gt;<i> a time in a controlled safe manner where no one gets hurt, same as these
</I>&gt;<i> people do when demolishing physical structures past their usefulness:
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.controlled-demolition.com/">http://www.controlled-demolition.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;And behind each successful project stands the CDI team - a talented
</I>&gt;<i> group of professionals with decades of experience dedicated to absolute
</I>&gt;<i> perfection on each new project.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  See, there are people whose whole careers are devoted to the safe
</I>&gt;<i> demolition of historic structures. And this essay is not intended in any way
</I>&gt;<i> to defend anyone who intentionally destroys structures in a way intended to
</I>&gt;<i> hurt people. ...
</I>&gt;<i>  At some point, after you are done building a new building (or a new
</I>&gt;<i> post-scarcity society) the scaffolding comes down. :-) But unlike the easier
</I>&gt;<i> time CDI has with demolishing vacant structures, it's much harder if people
</I>&gt;<i> (including PU alumni) still mistake that competitive capitalist scaffolding
</I>&gt;<i> for the post-scarcity building full of abundance the scaffolding surrounds
</I>&gt;<i> (and likely always did. :-) And I'm definitely hoping for that intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> scaffolding's removal in a controlled way, not a big crash like these where
</I>&gt;<i> often people get hurt: :-(
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;Images of catastrophically collapsed scaffolds&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=scaffolding+collapse">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=scaffolding+collapse</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are no doubt other reasons for the problems the USA is causing.  As
</I>&gt;<i> one person wrote to me (given I had referenced Bush's Lyme disease that
</I>&gt;<i> might have come from an accidentally released weaponized version): &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes wonder with what (mentally and physically) the neocons are also
</I>&gt;<i> infected. Historically, most if not all rulers have been infected with
</I>&gt;<i> insecurity, a compelling need to dominate from a basis of power &amp; greed, a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;need&quot; or compulsion to &quot;get even&quot; or to show those under them something -
</I>&gt;<i>  or to at least impress someone some how. The many STDs with which many
</I>&gt;<i> world leaders have been documented or reputed to carry (and transfer) may
</I>&gt;<i> explain some of their anger, and wishes to create suffering upon their own
</I>&gt;<i> sycophant subjects first, and then the world.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An interesting idea about STDs and centralized leadership. Maybe that is
</I>&gt;<i> another reason a peer economy makes sense -- it does not centralize STDs in
</I>&gt;<i> a small number of active politicians who are contracting them and then
</I>&gt;<i> making political decisions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, let's be very clear. Pricing is part of a rationing and control
</I>&gt;<i> system. Just because a control system fails (say, a computer in a car) does
</I>&gt;<i> not mean the rest of the system has any physical problems. Even if the car
</I>&gt;<i> won't start, it is still there, and could be repaired by replacing one tiny
</I>&gt;<i> component (an ideology of free market fundamentalism in this case).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote more on alternative approaches here:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  Here is a sample meta-theoretical framework PU economists no doubt could
</I>&gt;<i> vastly improve on if they turned their minds to it. Consider three levels of
</I>&gt;<i> nested perspectives on the same economic reality -- physical items, decision
</I>&gt;<i> makers, and emergent properties of decision maker interactions. (Three
</I>&gt;<i> levels of being or consciousness is a common theme in philosophical
</I>&gt;<i> writings, usually rock, plant, and animal, or plant, animal, and human.)
</I>&gt;<i>  At a first level of perspective, the world we live in at any point in time
</I>&gt;<i> can be considered to have physical content like land or tools or fusion
</I>&gt;<i> reactors like the sun, energy flows like photons from the sun or electrons
</I>&gt;<i> from lightning or in circuits, informational patterns like web page content
</I>&gt;<i> or distributed language knowledge, and active regulating processes
</I>&gt;<i> (including triggers, amplifiers, and feedback loops) built on the previous
</I>&gt;<i> three types of things (physicality, energy flow, and informational patterns)
</I>&gt;<i> embodied in living creatures, bi-metallic strip thermostats, or computer
</I>&gt;<i> programs running on computer hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>  One can think of a second perspective on the first comprehensive one by
</I>&gt;<i> picking out only the decision makers like bi-metallic strips in thermostats,
</I>&gt;<i> computer programs running on computers, and personalities embodied in people
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe someday robots or supercomputers, and looking at their
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics as individual decision makers.
</I>&gt;<i>  One can then think of a third level of perspective on the second where
</I>&gt;<i> decision makers may invent theories about how to control each other using
</I>&gt;<i> various approaches like internet communication standards, ration unit tokens
</I>&gt;<i> like fiat dollars, physical kanban tokens, narratives in emails, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> What the most useful theories are for controlling groups of decision makers
</I>&gt;<i> is an interesting question, but I will not explore it in depth. But I will
</I>&gt;<i> pointing out that complex system dynamics at this third level of perspective
</I>&gt;<i> can emerge whether control involves fiat dollars, &quot;kanban&quot; tokens,
</I>&gt;<i> centralized or distributed optimization based on perceived or predicted
</I>&gt;<i> demand patterns, human-to-human discussions, something else entirely, or a
</I>&gt;<i> diverse collection of all these things. And I will also point out that one
</I>&gt;<i> should never confuse the reality of the physical system being controlled for
</I>&gt;<i> the control signals (money, spoken words, kanban cards, internet packet
</I>&gt;<i> contents, etc.) being passed around in the control system.
</I>&gt;<i>  The above is somewhat inspired by &quot;cybernetics&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the market and fiat dollars is just one possible control system among
</I>&gt;<i> many. It has its good points and bad points in different contexts. You are
</I>&gt;<i> validly pointing to a fundamental weakness -- the fluff in our society is in
</I>&gt;<i> charge of the critical part. So, we either need to spread the wealth around,
</I>&gt;<i> highly regulate that part of the market (the US has tried, but done it
</I>&gt;<i> badly) or we need to take our infrastructure out of the market (some
</I>&gt;<i> government planning like Singapore, or peer alternatives and local
</I>&gt;<i> production, or some other way). Or some mix of all those things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what is fair to say is, in a theoretical market, with wealth roughly
</I>&gt;<i> evenly shared, the market responds to resource problems faced by everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> In a real market we have right now, with wealth heavily concentrated, the
</I>&gt;<i> market only responds to the needs of a few key individuals, and they spend
</I>&gt;<i> most of their money on fluff. :-) So, everyone else may starve amidst
</I>&gt;<i> plenty. Or, in other words, &quot;Let them eat virtual cake.&quot; :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have to look more at the rest of what you posted, which will take some
</I>&gt;<i> time. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've posted a tangentially related note I wrote elsewhere about die-offs
</I>&gt;<i> and carrying capacity and my disagreement with that premise.
