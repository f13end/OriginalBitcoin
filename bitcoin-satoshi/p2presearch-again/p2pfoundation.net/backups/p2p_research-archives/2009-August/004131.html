<PRE>Yes, gardening would work, Paul.  I like it.  I keep thinking the
manufacturing guys would build something that would support universal
fab...Andersen Consulting used to do stuff like this at a lab associated
with the research park at Northwestern.
It's another lego block concept.  Why couldn't math models be factors as I/O
standard devices that could be linked in open source frameworks at will.  In
a sense all object-oriented programming is what I am talking about...but it
should have a GUI and be easy.  Chunky math tools.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was intended to be a general tool, even if at the time it was oriented

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We ran out of money after 1.1 (released under the GPL with source) and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, we did not keep trying with lots of other funding sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you want to know why there is not free (and better) alternative to

</I>&gt;<i> *now* NSF funds some open stuff and related conferences,

</I>&gt;<i> Below I will attach some recommendations about current open source modeling
</I>&gt;<i> software written from a homeschooling perspective. One might be able to
</I>&gt;<i> start from those links and build up a whole environment for modeling these
</I>&gt;<i> sorts of issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is also another source of information I sent to a homeschooler with a
</I>&gt;<i> child interested in political science and video games:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Tell [name] I appreciate him mentioning that there were websites about
</I>&gt;<i> political games written in flash; I see there are a few:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=political+games">http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=political+games</A>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, here is a link for him also related to mixing his political
</I>&gt;<i> science interests with simulation and games (academic stuff like SimCity):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_society">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_society</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Artificial Society is the specific agent based computational model for
</I>&gt;<i> computer simulation in social analysis. It is mostly connected to the theme
</I>&gt;<i> in complex system, emergence, Monte Carlo Method, computational sociology,
</I>&gt;<i> multi-agent system, and evolutionary programming. The concept itself is
</I>&gt;<i> simple enough. Actually reaching this conceptual point took a while. Complex
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical models have been, and are, common; deceivingly simple models
</I>&gt;<i> only have their roots in the late forties, and took the advent of the
</I>&gt;<i> microcomputer to really get up to speed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  A few posts I had made about that field in 2002 (although most of the
</I>&gt;<i> links in those posts are no longer working):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/simulchaord-discuss/">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/simulchaord-discuss/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a related older book:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Growing Artificial Societies&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/1996/artifsoc.aspx">http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/1996/artifsoc.aspx</A>

</I>&gt;<i> And a recent article:

</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation</A>
</I>&gt;<i> So, lots of fun stuff that is also linked to cutting edge political
</I>&gt;<i> science.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, this is a very exciting area of research (even a dozen years later)
</I>&gt;<i> that I am still interested in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implicitly, a lot of what we are doing in the free culture movement is
</I>&gt;<i> creating for free and in public the equivalent of what neoconvervatives in
</I>&gt;<i> the USA did with lots of money in private. :-) Not to say money would not
</I>&gt;<i> help. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One could easily have hundreds (even thousands) of people in a research
</I>&gt;<i> institute working on this kind of stuff. Would be a lot of fun. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> The Brookings Institution had people doing that for a long time (links
</I>&gt;<i> above to a book by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell; Epstein is still at
</I>&gt;<i> Brookings).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A simulation and modeling and analysis environment might be one part of a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal in relation to the funding opportunities that you and Michel have
</I>&gt;<i> posted to the list for education and EU citizen participation and peer
</I>&gt;<i> governance. It also links with the Joseph Jackson initiative on games to an
</I>&gt;<i> extent. So, maybe, a long time later, such is now possible? I can hope it is
</I>&gt;<i> true for somebody. I agree the word really needs this sort of tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, such tools are all part of what I wanted the kitchen-sink of the
</I>&gt;<i> Pointrel Social Semantic Desktop to have as plug-in modules (or perhaps just
</I>&gt;<i> plugins that acted as gateways to existing mathematical packages like
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned below).
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointrel/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointrel/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For whatever reason, I just end up writing more emails instead though these
</I>&gt;<i> days though; I'm tremendously torn between writing more on abundance issues
</I>&gt;<i> and working on such software. I really should be working on the software
</I>&gt;<i> though, since, unlike writing emails, there is some tiny hope (as discussed
</I>&gt;<i> on the Open Manufacturing list) that I could supply a fee-based add-on
</I>&gt;<i> service for convenience for using the FOSS software. For example, if I could
</I>&gt;<i> get 50,000 users of the FOSS Pointrel system, and 1% paid US$100 a year for
</I>&gt;<i> the convenience of a related service like a relay server that was
</I>&gt;<i> pre-configured and backed up and came with an hour of tech support, that
</I>&gt;<i> would be terrific and let me keep doing that indefinitely. Still, with
</I>&gt;<i> Google Wave and Microsoft-owned Groove and NEPOMUK and several other
</I>&gt;<i> packages (OpenKollab in yet another attempt), it's not clear if the world
</I>&gt;<i> needs a new platform though, even if I feel my approach has some interesting
</I>&gt;<i> different characteristics. It is potentially more p2p in some ways,  because
</I>&gt;<i> it is intended to support keeping a copy of all information on the desktop,
</I>&gt;<i> plus running on Java it is fairly cross-platform, plus the data format is
</I>&gt;<i> designed to be extensible in a semantic web sort of way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'd be happy to be on any such proposals for such modeling tools,
</I>&gt;<i> content, and supporting infrastructure as long as the work was free and open
</I>&gt;<i> source. :-) Might as well get paid for stuff I want to do anyway, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> keep doing it longer. :-) Or afford to go to related conferences, etc. :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big three mentioned there are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Scilab
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.scilab.org/">http://www.scilab.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Scilab is a scientific software package for numerical computations
</I>&gt;<i> providing a powerful open computing environment for engineering and
</I>&gt;<i> scientific applications.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> See also the related Scicos:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.scicos.org/">http://www.scicos.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Scicos is a graphical dynamical system modeler and simulator toolbox
</I>&gt;<i> included in the  Scilab &#174;  engineering and scientific computation
</I>&gt;<i> software. With Scicos you can create block diagrams to model and
</I>&gt;<i> simulate the dynamics of hybrid dynamical systems and compile your
</I>&gt;<i> models into executable code. Scicos is used for signal processing,
</I>&gt;<i> systems control, queuing systems, and to study physical and biological
</I>&gt;<i> systems. New extensions allow generation of component based modeling of
</I>&gt;<i> electrical and hydraulic circuits using  the Modelica language.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Maxima
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">http://maxima.sourceforge.net/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
</I>&gt;<i> expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
</I>&gt;<i> Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
</I>&gt;<i> equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and tensors.
</I>&gt;<i> Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact fractions,
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary precision integers, and arbitrarily precision floating point
</I>&gt;<i> numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and three dimensions.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  R
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
</I>&gt;<i> graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and MacOS.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is another free package discussed at the first link:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
</I>&gt;<i> computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for
</I>&gt;<i> solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
</I>&gt;<i> other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
</I>&gt;<i> with Matlab.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is another (simpler) free package for statistics and plotting:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.gnuplot.info/">http://www.gnuplot.info/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Gnuplot  is a portable command-line driven interactive data and
</I>&gt;<i> function plotting utility for UNIX, IBM OS/2, MS Windows, DOS,
</I>&gt;<i> Macintosh, VMS, Atari and many other platforms. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, to get a lot out of any of them, you have to put some time into
</I>&gt;<i> them and probably consult additional reference materials in their
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial manuals, on the web, and/or in related textbooks. Also, these
</I>&gt;<i> tools are all are a matter of convenience -- a general purpose
</I>&gt;<i> programming tool with some good libraries (e.g. Python + SciPy)
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software">http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software</A>
</I>&gt;<i> can let you do pretty much anything these specialized packages do and in
</I>&gt;<i> a much more expandable way -- it just takes *much* more time and
</I>&gt;<i> understanding to work with the general tools (though you learn a lot
</I>&gt;<i> doing that). I'd suggest perhaps doing both -- play with the tools *and*
</I>&gt;<i> try to learn how to program with various packages. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see from especially the third link above, there are several
</I>&gt;<i> other tools. I'm not sure how well all of these run under other
</I>&gt;<i> operating systems (most probably do run under Windows, but my wife and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't use that ourselves anymore except under emulation on the Mac or
</I>&gt;<i> Linux). You can probably find most of theses tools included (or easily
</I>&gt;<i> loadable) in Ubuntu (a version of GNU/Linux), which is available for
</I>&gt;<i> free here (you can download and burn a bootable CD to run these when you
</I>&gt;<i> want by rebooting, even if you run Windows):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.ubuntu.com/">http://www.ubuntu.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and they also mail out free CDs (but it may take some time -- see the
</I>&gt;<i> links on that page). There is also an &quot;Edubuntu&quot; educational variant,
</I>&gt;<i> but it seems more targeted at schools and I haven't tried it.
</I>&gt;<i> Instructions for loading some of these packages into Ubuntu:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&amp;t=402802&amp;highlight=Mathematical+software">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&amp;t=402802&amp;highlight=Mathematical+software</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any one of these packages is a project to get to know and understand. It
</I>&gt;<i> might takes quite a while to get a feel for them. But I think mastering
</I>&gt;<i> any of these packages will have a lot of practical value -- more so than
</I>&gt;<i> doing some paper exercises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While our child is [not that old] (and so I haven't tried to use these
</I>&gt;<i> packages to teach him math; I'm still focusing on John Holt's ideas of
</I>&gt;<i> seeing how small numbers like nine can be broken down and assembled many
</I>&gt;<i> ways), I have been involved tangentially with some people doing
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical education using computer software for more advanced math,
</I>&gt;<i> primarily using the programming language Python.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a newer way of thinking about math and physics which suggests
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about that as just a subpart of computer programming, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a more classical school subject approach which often puts computer
</I>&gt;<i> programming as an add-on under math &amp; physics. :-) Essentially, by
</I>&gt;<i> developing programs and simulations of interest to a child, a child
</I>&gt;<i> learns more and more about basic principles of mathematics they need to
</I>&gt;<i> solve problems of interest to them, as well as to develop a certain type
</I>&gt;<i> of mathematical thinking skills related to precision and causality and
</I>&gt;<i> symbol manipulation and so on. Learning to program then becomes the
</I>&gt;<i> stepping stone to learning about math and physics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a child can learn a lot about trigonometry by just playing
</I>&gt;<i> around with a 2D or 3D turtle:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;turtle -- Turtle graphics for Tk using Python&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> However they typically need to learn a little programming first (like
</I>&gt;<i> how to write a loop). Consider, for example, this college assignment:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Mandelbrot, Turtle Graphics and L-Systems in Python&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html">http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think those sorts of experiments could keep a high schooler busy
</I>&gt;<i> for quite a while, while also learning about angles and distances and
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical reasoning (while they debug their graphical programs); but
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't try those as a first step for someone who did not already
</I>&gt;<i> know programming. Here is a simple code snippet for someone wanting to
</I>&gt;<i> learn some simple programming and turtle graphics with Python:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Turtle Graphics (Python)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html">http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Modify that to draw a few geometric shapes (cubes, octagons,
</I>&gt;<i> parallelograms, etc.) and it's a start down the path of 2D geometry. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a bigger set of links (mostly programs) related to
</I>&gt;<i> Python+Geometry for homeschoolers
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html">http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In general the author of that site has a lot to say about the
</I>&gt;<i> intersection of computing and mathematics.

</I>&gt;<i> To get more advanced in 3D geometry, here is a free package by the late
</I>&gt;<i> Arthur Siegel to do interactive 3D geometry in Python:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/">http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;PyGeo is most fundamentally a framework for the creation of dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> geometric constructions - i.e. constructions which embody defined and
</I>&gt;<i> persistent geometric relationships responsive to real time on-screen
</I>&gt;<i> interactivity. PyGeo is, further, an implementation of this underlying
</I>&gt;<i> abstract framework - exposing a range of geometric objects as the
</I>&gt;<i> building blocks for virtual, dynamic geometric constructions. The focus
</I>&gt;<i> is away from Euclidian geometry and metrics, and toward later geometric
</I>&gt;<i> and mathematical developments - particularly those connected with
</I>&gt;<i> projective geometry of real space, and the geometry of complex numbers
</I>&gt;<i> on the plane and on the unit (Riemann) sphere.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing about school-style trigonometry &quot;proofs&quot; there though -- except
</I>&gt;<i> the ones you build for yourself in passing to debug things. Here's lots
</I>&gt;<i> of links related to logic software and logic education if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> focus on proofs (includes some links to theorem provers):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html">http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> But I would think this a dustier and drier route for most kids to get an
</I>&gt;<i> intuition for geometrical things than indirectly via programming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, some fraction of the population has trouble visualizing or
</I>&gt;<i> rotating things in 2D or 3D,
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability</A>
</I>&gt;<i> so some kids find geometry much easier than others. I think 3D spatial
</I>&gt;<i> visualization tools may help narrow that gap, especially tools which can
</I>&gt;<i> make the 3d object rotate (at least slightly). Related exercises:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Spatial Encounters: Exercises in Spatial Awareness.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.womentechstore.com/edpw031-spatial-encounters-introduction.html">http://www.womentechstore.com/edpw031-spatial-encounters-introduction.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED236183&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED236183">http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED236183&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED236183</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise some kids almost need to visualize things to feel they
</I>&gt;<i> understand them as opposed to accept purely symbolic representations;
</I>&gt;<i> there are various approaches to mathematics that are more highly visual
</I>&gt;<i> than others. Example:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html">http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is one issue that may make or break in some advanced math
</I>&gt;<i> studies, it is an ability to visualize. If the kid in question isn't
</I>&gt;<i> good at that, it may help more to focus early on visualization skills
</I>&gt;<i> (including blueprint reading) than to move ahead to more advanced topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is another programming language system Squeak (Smalltalk) which has
</I>&gt;<i> various educational tools in it like turtles:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.squeak.org/Features/">http://www.squeak.org/Features/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It has a steeper learning curve than Python though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my own life I've found the only major use for trigonometry was
</I>&gt;<i> writing 3D graphics software. :-) Here is a example of such software
</I>&gt;<i> (available for free) which my wife and I wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm">http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;PlantStudio Botanical Illustration Software is a tool for creating 3D
</I>&gt;<i> plant models and 2D illustrations. PlantStudio simulates herbaceous
</I>&gt;<i> (non-woody) plants like wildflowers and cut flowers, vegetables, weeds,
</I>&gt;<i> grasses, and herbs using a parameter-driven simulation of plant growth
</I>&gt;<i> and structure. You can &quot;grow&quot; plants over their life cycles, producing
</I>&gt;<i> lifelike images at any age. You can design, animate and breed a wide
</I>&gt;<i> variety of plants. By using the &quot;evolutionary arts&quot; of variation and
</I>&gt;<i> selection in the plant breeder, you can quickly and easily create whole
</I>&gt;<i> families of unique plants for your 3D scenes.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot of stuff in there about angles and rotations and so on --
</I>&gt;<i> can't help but learn a little about trigonometry (and botany) even by
</I>&gt;<i> just playing with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I know schools tend to focus on a chain of algebra, trigonometry,
</I>&gt;<i> calculus, (especially for kids interested in engineering) I'd suggest
</I>&gt;<i> learning about probability and statistics (done as part of developing a
</I>&gt;<i> computer simulation) would generally be a more useful mathematical skill
</I>&gt;<i> in the real world for most people, since we all need to make decisions
</I>&gt;<i> every day related to risks and also trying to read between the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> newspaper articles and advertisements throwing statistics around in an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to inform or persuade us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, here is a fun link about how to lie with statistics:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ok...this is what you have been waiting for. How can you lie with
</I>&gt;<i> statistics? Actually, the purpose of this page is NOT to teach you how
</I>&gt;<i> to lie and cheat with statistics. Rather, I hope you will learn how it
</I>&gt;<i> is possible to be misled and how to spot &quot;statistical abuse.&quot; You can
</I>&gt;<i> find poor use of statistics everywhere...magazines, newspapers, polls,
</I>&gt;<i> TV, even research papers. I do not want to hear of any of you readers
</I>&gt;<i> using these poor methods.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here is a book on that topic:
</I>&gt;<i>  _How to Lie With Statistics_
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728">http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also a variety of free instructional videos available over the
</I>&gt;<i> web as part of the Annenberg CPB project if you have a fast internet
</I>&gt;<i> connection (and otherwise likely available from a local library or
</I>&gt;<i> through interlibrary loan):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html">http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Exmaples:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Against All Odds: Inside Statistics; This video instructional series
</I>&gt;<i> for college and high school classrooms and adult learners leads to a
</I>&gt;<i> greater understanding of statistics by exploring authentic examples &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> from environmental studies to weight-loss programs.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Algebra: In Simplest Terms; This video instructional series for college
</I>&gt;<i> and high school classrooms and adult learners guides students
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step through algebra concepts, while highlighting common trouble
</I>&gt;<i> spots.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Learning Math: Geometry; Learn the basics of geometry in this video-
</I>&gt;<i> and Web-based course for K-8 teachers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't watched any of those, but many years ago I did go through the
</I>&gt;<i> entire Mechanical Universe physics series for myself and liked it:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The Mechanical Universe&#8230;and Beyond; This video instructional series
</I>&gt;<i> for college and high school classrooms and adult learners demystifies
</I>&gt;<i> physics and illustrates abstract concepts.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Physics ends up being mostly math at more advanced stages.)
</I>&gt;<i> I also enjoyed their World of Chemistry, but I didn't see that is
</I>&gt;<i> online. There is also an accompanying textbook to the Mechanical
</I>&gt;<i> Universe; if you really wanted something like a curriculum, that might
</I>&gt;<i> be a way to go which integrates mathematics into a physical setting that
</I>&gt;<i> helps motivate its study.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, plenty of open-ended free resources to play with and learn
</I>&gt;<i> something mathematical for kids or adults.
