<PRE>Hi Vinay,

I'm intrigued by your new tools for the land question comment, could you
specify?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  IMO profit doesn't result automatically from ownership.  Profit

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  results from capital ownership, vis a vis the consumer, when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  creates artificial scarcity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So if we could somehow &quot;start over&quot; - say if a group of people landed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  on a deserted island or began trying to populate a planet without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  connection to the previous society - would you say that would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  enough to fix it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It might.  If they had rid themselves of all the assumptions of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legitimizing ideology of the old system, and understood the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; institutional basis of exploitation in the old system, and set up the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new one without it, I think it would.  But it would be better to start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the present system, with its existing technological legacy and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; human capital, and simply remove the institutional basis of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exploitation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  If you answer yes, then I wonder how we arrived where we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; today.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  mean, how did the [e]state gain so much power over us to begin with?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the state originally arose as an instrument of exploitation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when the peasant villagers and the artisans in the towns began to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce a sufficient surplus to support a parasitic ruling class.  And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the hegemonic ideologies in every society since have served the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primary purpose of justifying the rule of the parasitic ruling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes, and posting the interest of the ruling class as the interest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of &quot;society.&quot;  This is essentially Oppenheimer's conquest theory of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the state, although I think he was too narrow in limiting the scenario
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to external conquest.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  In a competitive market without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  privilege, artificial property rights or artificial scarcity, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  expect the price of a carpet service to be just enough to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; amortize all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  costs and pay for the labor of those running it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Well, if workers are the only owners, then Wages and Profit won't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  cleanly separated, so there probably IS a good chance that profit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  could reach zero since anything that might have been labled profit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  will simply be labled Wages by those Worker/Owners who would want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  keep their own income as high as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  But when ownership is determined by those who consume the outputs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  that production, and who pay for the purchase or construction of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Sources of that production, then Wages are a cost to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; minimized, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Profit becomes a measure of the need for ownership.  Any consumer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pays
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  profit when they do not yet have sufficient ownership in the Sources
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  needed for that production.  This can be balanced by treating that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  payment as an investment from the consumer who paid it - to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; eventually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  vest to him as his real property so that he will eventually (when he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  finally has enough ownership of physical Sources) own all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; outputs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  of production he needs even before they are produced.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the other hand, the whole purpose of a worker's production is his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own consumption, either directly by production for use or indirectly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by production for exchange with equal producers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The disutility of labor is the source of all exchange value, in a free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; market, for goods whose supply can be increased indefinitely in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; response to demand.  Profits on capital and rent on land are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deductions from this exchange value created by labor, resulting from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the ability of owners of capital and land to collect artificial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scarcity rents.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interpreting things in terms of a society of laborers attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maximize the output of use-value per input of labor makes more sense,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me, than a society of consumers trying to minimize the wages of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; labor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  To explain that last sentence, just imagine the owner of an apple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  tree.  He owns the apples even before they are produced, and can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  pay pure costs, since it would be impossible to pay profit unless he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  were to pay it to himself.  To scale this all the way down, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  that an individual actually might choose to pay &quot;price above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; cost&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  himself in a manner - in that he might be investing in future
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  production by buying more trees or better tools or more land etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  This seems to prove that profit should be understood as a consumer's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  investment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not necessarily.  The owner of the orchard is still transforming his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own labor directly into consumption, and the apples he consumes are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the product of his labor.  His use of part of his labor-product for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capital investment is a way of making his own labor more productive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that his ratio of labor input per unit of consumption is minimized.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  In other words, he is a worker maximizing the use value created per
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unit of labor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  How can a consumer increase utilization to the point of making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  ownership &quot;worth it&quot;?  One way is to buy the machine with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  other consumers.  Organizing with your neighbors to buy a rug-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doctor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  is cheaper if there are enough of you to keep that equipment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; busy, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  why don't we (consumers) do this more often?  Why do we leave that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  work of organizing up to a business that intends to charge us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; price
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  above cost?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  The intention to charge a price above cost does not automatically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  translate into the ability.  If market entry is free,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; competition will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  lower the price to cost.  The only way the equilibrium price can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  remain above cost is if some entry barrier prevents competition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  lowering it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But market entry is not free, even on a deserted island because of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  costs such as the difficulty in &quot;ramping up&quot; and the time needed for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  those investment to begin producing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's free in the sense that there is no coercive constraint on it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; During the lag time it takes for new market entrants to get an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operation up and running, the original producer will collect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entrepreneurial profits for being first in the field.  But these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entrepreneurial profits are themselves an incentive for others to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enter the field.  And the result is that new entrants drive the price
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down to cost of production.  This is the normal process, if artificial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entry barriers prevent others from entering an industry, or give one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; firm a legal monopoly on some productive innovation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  For instance, let's say I am in a large cruise ship that crashes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  killing all but 7 people - including me - shipwrecked on an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; uncharted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  island.  As I look around I notice the plants and animals seem oddly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  familiar.  It suddenly dawns on me these are the same ornamental
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  organisms that the people of 1st world countries have chosen to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  running on the soil around their homes and througout all of their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  cities.  There is green and flowering everywhere, but it is all a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  wasteland of worthless, and in some cases even poisonous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fabricators.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  None of the mushrooms are useful for medicine or food.  No chicken,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  cattle, turkey or geese - only dogs, cats and songbirds.  No nut
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  trees.  No grape vines.  No bees.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Luckily some sealed rations wash ashore, including some steel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; cans of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  wheat and few whole spices that we are able to sprout and begin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  growing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  We build simple bellows and construct a crude forge to melt the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; steel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  and aluminum scraps that also wash ashore.  We also use the forge to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  make glass from some of the more pure beach sand.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  After a couple years, you crash-land onto the same island in a much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  smaller boat.  You have no food, no tools, no seed, and not even any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  land to stand on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Let's say the 7 original islanders are not happy about your arrival,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  and treat you similarly to how &quot;M. Fioretti&quot; mentioned in his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; response
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  to this thread:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; (semi-serious) we, that is any generic group of neighbors in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  generic city, all hate each other and the least interact the better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  we feel:-)''
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Even if we 'let' you work for us, we could price the food we sell to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  you so high, and the land and tools so high that it may take you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; years
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  to be able afford some land and fully own a house, in fact we could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  delay it forever - just as almost nobody in the US actually owns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  house, they all OWE their house.  You'd &quot;owe your soul to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  store&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Wouldn't you agree there are barriers to entry even without a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  state?  I would say it is because the estate IS the state.  When you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  pay a price higher than the cost (including wages) that it really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; took
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  to grow the wheat and bake the slice of bread you ate, wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  nice if that 'extra' you paid (profit) became your investment in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  fields, ovens, etc. even if  you don't have any of those exact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; skills
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  - so that you slowly become &quot;set up&quot; as you pay &quot;price above cost&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, under those circumstances.  But it's an artificial situation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which abstracts out precisely the conditions that I consider relevant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for eliminating exploitation.  On your island, the land and natural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources have been completely appropriated by the original seven
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; settlers (let's stipulate for the sake of argument that they make full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use of them, so their appropriation is legitimate and not the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political appropriation of vacant and unused land described by Henry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; George and Franz Oppenheimer).  In the real world, however, the vast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority of land is held out of use by political appropriation, and is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artificially scarce.  In the real world, if artificial title to vacant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; land were abolished, labor would have independent access to the means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of subsistence, which would exert upward pressure on wages.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effect of state-enforced legal privilege, in the world we actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; live in, is to artificially create the conditions of scarcity that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exist naturally on your island.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I think another part of the problem is in figuring out how those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  resources should be shared among the owners.  It is a difficult,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  sticky situation that most people would rather just avoid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; altogether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  because of the in-fighting they perceive would occur.  It seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  group could write some 'rules' about how to schedule access and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  much each individual must compensate the others for any extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wear or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  exclusion they cause.  I see such a contract, if 'properly'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; written,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  would be the only thing our society needs to begin down the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; road of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  peace and abundance, but will delay that discussion for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  This general principle of cooperative consumer ownership of cars,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  appliances, etc., is a good one IMO.  Another example would be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  pooling of resources by a village to share tractors and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  mechanical equipment and use them in common, rather than hiring a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  capitalist firm.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  But I think the reason for taking the own rather than hire approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  whenever possible is really to increase one's economic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; independence:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  specifically, to reduce future needs for outside income, to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  dependence on future wage labor to meet one's basic consumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; needs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  and to reduce vulnerability to the business cycle and the threat of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  unemployment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Those are good reasons too.  But are you also claiming it is possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  for the owner of an apple tree to pay profit for the procurement of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  those apples?  In other words, is consumer ownership is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  operationally efficient than having the trees owned only by those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  happen to possess the skills needed to plant, tend, harvest, etc.?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  Won't the workers overpay themselves if they are the owners?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not if other workers have free access to vacant land on which to raise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apples, and there are no artificial barriers (like occupational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing) to the transfer of skill.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I think you're getting things backward.  The disutility of labor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the source of exchange value.  The only reason people engage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; productive labor is either for their own direct consumption, or to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receive in exchange the labor-product of others.  In a society of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; productive laborers, the real economic calculus will be of the ratio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of effort to consumption.  Workers will engage in productive labor in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those cases where the consumption (either through direct production
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for use or production for indirect consumption for exchange) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sufficient to make the expenditure of labor worth it.  In an autarkic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; farm, the subsistence farmer will expend effort in those pursuits that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he considers worth it in terms of the unit of consumption per unit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effort, and he will refrain from effort in those pursuits not worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.  The calculus is the same when he begins exchanging his effort for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the product of others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  If it is most efficient for the workers to own, and many small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  businesses are worker-owned, and if the concepts of efficiency in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  scale are overrated, then why is there a problem?  Oh yes, you will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  say it is the privilege handed out by the state.  I wholeheartedly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  agree that almost every government on earth is directly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; puppeteered by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  corporations that sometimes even write the very legislation that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  them even more privilege.  Much of this is fully above-board
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  (technically legal), again because the rules of interaction were and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  are written by those very same corporations.  So enormously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; important
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  policy decisions - such as whether or not to invade the nearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  defenseless countries of Afghanistan and Iraq are influenced by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  profits those policy makers receive because of their investments in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's basically my argument.  Worker ownership is far less widespread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than it would be in a free market.  But I might issue the same
