<PRE>Yunus's and Chris Cook's models are exactly what I am doing now, and have
been doing for close to 3 years

I call it voluntary business cooperation around a commons. My business is
based almost totally around common pool resources, open source software,
open knowledge use and production, and value network partnerships. Everyone
is self employed, no one is an employee of me. Agreements are made about how
to share profit, how to sustain the common pool resources we draw from. This
is in the binding contracts.

So, Social Enterprise if great for smaller individuals.

I think Natural Capitalism comes into play as a viable option for long
established mega-businesses, like GM, Ford, Dow Chemical, Proctor and Gamble
etc etc

I can tell you that these businesses need way to transition away from
hardcore industrial hierarchical industrial solutions, and the ideas in
Natural Capitalism are part of that. These huge businesses are *not* going
to radically change in the ways suggested by the work Yunus and others are
doing. This will be a type of change they are NOT ready for. But, they will
be ready for what Adam Arvidsson is describing as the &quot;Ethical Economy&quot;.

<A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/ethical-economy/2007/11/19">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/ethical-economy/2007/11/19</A>

 Frameworks like Natural Capitalism will help bug business in particular
transition into being able to support emerging Social Enterprise in the
&quot;Ethical Economy&quot;.  If we do not help big business change in ways they are
ready to change into, they will either &quot;circle the wagons&quot; and stay where
they are, or they will &quot;regress&quot;, and fight against the change. So, it makes
the most sense to give evolutionary and progressive pathways for big
business to change, and that is what Natural Capitalism does.

For people like me, down here in the muck, Social Enterprise is a more
realistic pathway to change. Teaming up with others like me, and voluntarily
pooling resources, working through collaboration, cooperation.

</I>&gt;<i> as well.  His solution is also aligned: the &quot;social business,&quot; aka my
</I>&gt;<i> businesstrust, aka Chris Cook's open corporate partnership.  Yunus' take on
</I>&gt;<i> why profit-driven businesses aren't feasible for real public good is concise
</I>&gt;<i> and accurate.  If you get a chance, please check it out, but if not, his
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts will be included with my &quot;synthesis&quot; of the models.  I put that in
</I>&gt;<i> quotes because, in reality, they're describing the same systems with little

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hello fellow researchers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This post is a first step toward describing the very basics of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; economic activity - including such topics as ownership, production,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; profit, policy, governance, growth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This material should be understandable by any audience, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; concentrates on issues that are not so commonly discussed, so should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be interesting to even the most hardened economist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I hope you will help me shape this into a full description of how we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have arrived at the dangerous centralization of power we now face at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the global level.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Please give critical feedback with logical arguments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This first part shows that individual consumer ownership is the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; efficient arrangement when utilization/price is large enough, and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; individual consumers already choose that path.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Part One: The Utilization-to-Price Ratio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why do most people choose to buy an automobile instead of renting?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why do most people choose to rent a rug-doctor instead of buying?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When a person can make use of (utilize) a machine to a sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; degree, it is more efficient for them to OWN instead of RENT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But wait, how could that be?  The owner (whoever he is) must pay all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; costs either way.  A rental agency must pay for the initial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; investment, upkeep/repair/maintenance/wear, insurance,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; protection/security, storage, taxes, and any wages to workers needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to do any of those thing.  A private owner must pay those exact same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; costs, so how could it possibly be cheaper to own outright instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rent?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The difference is called 'profit'.  Profit is the difference between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the costs an owner pays and the price a consumer is willing to pay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When the owner and consumer are the same person, there is no such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing as profit.  That is the savings in ownership over rental.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But what about machines that are not &quot;worth it&quot; to own because that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; individual cannot sufficiently utilize them?  It must be worth it for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SOMEONE to own them, otherwise the rental agency wouldn't do so.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; difference here is a matter of utilization.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; How can a consumer increase utilization to the point of making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ownership &quot;worth it&quot;?  One way is to buy the machine with a group of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; other consumers.  Organizing with your neighbors to buy a rug-doctor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is cheaper if there are enough of you to keep that equipment busy, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; why don't we (consumers) do this more often?  Why do we leave that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; work of organizing up to a business that intends to charge us price
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; above cost?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There is real work involved in the act of organization, but that cost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (wages to management) must be paid either way.  So what is keeping us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (the consumers) from organizing and cooperatively owning machines,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; buildings, even land?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think part of the problem is a long-standing belief that whoever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; possesses the skills to operate those machines should be the owners,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but doesn't the above argument show that the consumers must be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; owners for optimum efficiency?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think another part of the problem is in figuring out how those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; resources should be shared among the owners.  It is a difficult,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sticky situation that most people would rather just avoid altogether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; because of the in-fighting they perceive would occur.  It seems such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; group could write some 'rules' about how to schedule access and how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; much each individual must compensate the others for any extra wear or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; exclusion they cause.  I see such a contract, if 'properly' written,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be the only thing our society needs to begin down the road of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; peace and abundance, but will delay that discussion for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Cooperative consumer ownership is quite rare today, but there are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; few cases where a group of friends wanting a private airplane make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;shared investment&quot;, and then rent the plane from the collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; others whenever they want to use it.  None of those people need the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ability to fly themselves, they can just hire a pilot and pay that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wage as a cost while still saving money by not paying profit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Another example is shared ownership of a vacation house.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for-profit &quot;Time Share&quot; industry has grown around that desire, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; referring to the less common case when a private group of people buy a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; house that they share amongst themselves in whatever way they see fit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
