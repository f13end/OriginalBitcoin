<PRE>Hi Andreas et al

Hmmmmm I guess I wasn't aware that there were other publication ideas
that were going ahead, also sorry to hear that this wasn't necessarily
an agreed item, I was under the impression that it was. I have heard
from nearly all of the speakers with proposals so I am really under the
assumption that most people are ok with this. Are there any participants
who would prefer to do it another way?

At the Capital and Class AGM on Saturday, the other editors were very
sympathetic to this idea and I was given the go-ahead to proceed. Not
all papers will necessarily be included, of course: it depends on the
final proposal I assimilate and on the willingness of course, of
participants, to see Capital and Class as an agreeable forum for
publication.

Does anyone else have insight or comments to make on this? 

Many thanks
Phoebe

Hi Phoebe,
 
I don't think that I received your first email, so this one comes a bit
as a surprise to me. It seems like your plans of a Capital &amp; Class
special issue are already well developed.
I remember you mentioning this possibility at the workshop, but don't
recall that there was a general agreement to have C&amp;C as first
publication choice. Also this would somehow collide with my idea to make
a book with most of the contributions. No publisher would accept a book
proposal with contributions that are already published somewhere else. 
As aleady indicated in several emails preparing the workshop my first
publication choice would either be an edited book or a special issue
with a well recognised journal, and we have aleady an expression of
interest from TCS, which does have a much broader reach than C&amp;C.
For this reason I am still keen on a discussion about core issues
emerging from the workshop (in terms of relevance) and about issues
where participants had different perspectives, standpoints, and
arguments. This debate has not really started yet and after paternity
leave I will sure make some comments on this. For me this debate is
crucial as it will define which theme(s) should be put at the forefront
of a publication.
Hope this makes sense,
Andreas

Subject: [p2p-research] Capital and Class issue



Hi all

After my call for papers for the special edition emerging from our
workshop on p2p production at Nottingham Trent, I have received 5
abstracts, three papers, and 2 possible inclusion statements, many
thanks to all of you. If you haven't submitted one to me, please do so
and I'll include you. Please include a short bibliography as well.

In the special issue I want to put the question of 'ethical economy/ies'
at the forefront because I think this discussion brings up a lot of
important points as well as questions regarding measurement of value,
and exchange relations 'outside' of capitalism, and so far I have been
given both proposals that critique, and advocate p2p as an arena for
these possibilities. The proposals so far represent the discussion that
is taking place more broadly and Capital and Class will be an excellent
forum for this discussion.

The AGM for the journal is tomorrow and I've 'warned' them of my
intention to create this special issue. I'll be in touch with you after
the meeting with more details of what will be required. At this rate,
the papers will not need to be very long and I'd probably make a
deadline for next March or so (just something to bear in mind).

Many thanks
Phoebe
