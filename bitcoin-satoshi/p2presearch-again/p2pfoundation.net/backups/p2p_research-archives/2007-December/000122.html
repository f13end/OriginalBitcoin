One wonders what the concepts below will mean in combination
with symmetric FttH connections worldwide.

Is this The Net 2.0

Or 3.0?

One quote:

&quot;As the sea of business and scientific data rises, computing
power turns into a strategic resource, a form of capital.
&quot;In a sense,&quot; says Yahoo Research Chief Prabhakar Raghavan,
&quot;there are only five computers on earth.&quot; He lists Google, Yahoo,
Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon. Few others, he says, can turn
electricity into computing power with comparable efficiency.&quot;

 Google and the Wisdom of Clouds A lofty new strategy aims to put incredible
computing power in the hands of many

by Stephen Baker &lt;<A HREF="http://www.businessweek.com/print/bios/Stephen_Baker.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/print/bios/Stephen_Baker.htm</A>&gt;

One simple question. That's all it took for Christophe Bisciglia to bewilder
confident job applicants at Google
(GOOG&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG</A>
&gt;<i>).
</I>Bisciglia, an angular 27-year-old senior software engineer with long wavy
hair, wanted to see if these undergrads were ready to think like Googlers.
&quot;Tell me,&quot; he'd say, &quot;what would you do if you had 1,000 times more data?&quot;

What a strange idea. If they returned to their school projects and were
foolish enough to cram formulas with a thousand times more details about
shopping or maps or?heaven forbid?with video files, they'd slow their
college servers to a crawl.

At that point in the interview, Bisciglia would explain his question. To
thrive at Google, he told them, they would have to learn to work?and to
dream?on a vastly larger scale. He described Google's globe-spanning network
of computers. Yes, they answered search queries instantly. But together they
also blitzed through mountains of data, looking for answers or intelligence
faster than any machine on earth. Most of this hardware wasn't on the Google
campus. It was just out there, somewhere on earth, whirring away in big
refrigerated data centers. Folks at Google called it &quot;the cloud.&quot; And one
challenge of programming at Google was to leverage that cloud?to push it to
do things that would overwhelm lesser machines. New hires at Google,
Bisciglia says, usually take a few months to get used to this scale. &quot;Then
one day, you see someone suggest a wild job that needs a few thousand
machines, and you say: Hey, he gets it.'&quot;

What recruits needed, Bisciglia eventually decided, was advance training. So
one autumn day a year ago, when he ran into Google CEO Eric E. Schmidt
between meetings, he floated an idea. He would use his 20% time, the
allotment Googlers have for independent projects, to launch a course. It
would introduce students at his alma mater, the University of Washington, to
programming at the scale of a cloud. Call it Google 101. Schmidt liked the
plan. Over the following months, Bisciglia's Google 101 would evolve and
grow. It would eventually lead to an ambitious partnership with IBM
(IBM&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM</A>
&gt;<i>),
</I>announced in October, to plug universities around the world into Google-like
computing clouds.

As this concept spreads, it promises to expand Google's footprint in
industry far beyond search, media, and advertising, leading the giant into
scientific research and perhaps into new businesses. In the process Google
could become, in a sense, the world's primary computer.

&quot;I had originally thought [Bisciglia] was going to work on education, which
was fine,&quot; Schmidt says late one recent afternoon at Google headquarters.
&quot;Nine months later, he comes out with this new [cloud] strategy, which was
completely unexpected.&quot; The idea, as it developed, was to deliver to
students, researchers, and entrepreneurs the immense power of Google-style
computing, either via Google's machines or others offering the same service.


What is Google's cloud? It's a network made of hundreds of thousands, or by
some estimates 1 million, cheap servers, each not much more powerful than
the PCs we have in our homes. It stores staggering amounts of data,
including numerous copies of the World Wide Web. This makes search faster,
helping ferret out answers to billions of queries in a fraction of a second.
Unlike many traditional supercomputers, Google's system never ages. When its
individual pieces die, usually after about three years, engineers pluck them
out and replace them with new, faster boxes. This means the cloud
regenerates as it grows, almost like a living thing.

A move towards clouds signals a fundamental shift in how we handle
information. At the most basic level, it's the computing equivalent of the
evolution in electricity a century ago when farms and businesses shut down
their own generators and bought power instead from efficient industrial
utilities. Google executives had long envisioned and prepared for this
change. Cloud computing, with Google's machinery at the very center, fit
neatly into the company's grand vision, established a decade ago by founders
Sergey Brin and Larry Page: &quot;to organize the world's information and make it
universally accessible.&quot; Bisciglia's idea opened a pathway toward this
future. &quot;Maybe he had it in his brain and didn't tell me,&quot; Schmidt says. &quot;I
didn't realize he was going to try to change the way computer scientists
thought about computing. That's a much more ambitious goal.&quot;
ONE-WAY STREET

For small companies and entrepreneurs, clouds mean opportunity?a leveling of
the playing field in the most data-intensive forms of computing. To date,
only a select group of cloud-wielding Internet giants has had the resources
to scoop up huge masses of information and build businesses upon it. Our
words, pictures, clicks, and searches are the raw material for this
industry. But it has been largely a one-way street. Humanity emits the data,
and a handful of companies?the likes of Google, Yahoo!
(YHOO&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=YHOO">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=YHOO</A>
&gt;<i>),
</I>or Amazon.com (AMZN&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AMZN">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AMZN</A>
&gt;<i>)?transform
</I>the info into insights, services, and, ultimately, revenue.

This status quo is already starting to change. In the past year, Amazon has
opened up its own networks of computers to paying customers, initiating new
players, large and small, to cloud computing. Some users simply park their
massive databases with Amazon. Others use Amazon's computers to mine data or
create Web services. In November, Yahoo opened up a cluster of computers?a
small cloud?for researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. And Microsoft (
MSFT&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MSFT">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MSFT</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>has deepened its ties to communities of scientific researchers by providing
them access to its own server farms. As these clouds grow, says Frank Gens,
senior analyst at market research firm IDC, &quot;A whole new community of Web
startups will have access to these machines. It's like they're planting
Google seeds.&quot; Many such startups will emerge in science and medicine, as
data-crunching laboratories searching for new materials and drugs set up
shop in the clouds.

For clouds to reach their potential, they should be nearly as easy to
program and navigate as the Web. This, say analysts, should open up growing
markets for cloud search and software tools?a natural business for Google
and its competitors. Schmidt won't say how much of its own capacity Google
will offer to outsiders, or under what conditions or at what prices.
&quot;Typically, we like to start with free,&quot; he says, adding that power users
&quot;should probably bear some of the costs.&quot; And how big will these clouds
grow? &quot;There's no limit,&quot; Schmidt says. As this strategy unfolds, more
people are starting to see that Google is poised to become a dominant force
in the next stage of computing. &quot;Google aspires to be a large portion of the
cloud, or a cloud that you would interact with every day,&quot; the CEO says. The
business plan? For now, Google remains rooted in its core business, which
gushes with advertising revenue. The cloud initiative is barely a blip in
terms of investment. It hovers in the distance, large and hazy and still
hard to piece together, but bristling with possibilities.

Changing the nature of computing and scientific research wasn't at the top
of Bisciglia's agenda the day he collared Schmidt. What he really wanted, he
says, was to go back to school. Unlike many of his colleagues at Google, a
place teeming with PhDs, Bisciglia was snatched up by the company as soon as
he graduated from the University of Washington, or U-Dub, as nearly everyone
calls it. He'd never been a grad student. He ached for a break from his
daily routines at Google?the 10-hour workdays building search algorithms in
his cube in Building 44, the long commutes on Google buses from the
apartment he shared with three roomies in San Francisco's Duboce Triangle.
He wanted to return to Seattle, if only for one day a week, and work with
his professor and mentor, Ed Lazowska. &quot;I had an itch to teach,&quot; he says.

He didn't think twice before vaulting over the org chart and batting around
his idea directly with the CEO. Bisciglia and Schmidt had known each other
for years. Shortly after landing at Google five years ago as a 22-year-old
programmer, Bisciglia worked in a cube across from the CEO's office. He'd
wander in, he says, drawn in part by the model airplanes that reminded him
of his mother's work as a United Airlines
(UAUA&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=UAUA">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=UAUA</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>hostess. Naturally he talked with the soft-spoken, professorial CEO about
computing. It was almost like college. And even after Bisciglia moved to
other buildings, the two stayed in touch. (&quot;He's never too hard to track
down, and he's incredible about returning e-mails,&quot; Bisciglia says.)

On the day they first discussed Google 101, Schmidt offered one nugget of
advice: Narrow down the project to something Bisciglia could have up and
running in two months. &quot;I actually didn't care what he did,&quot; Schmidt
recalls. But he wanted the young engineer to get feedback in a hurry. Even
if Bisciglia failed, he says, &quot;he's smart, and he'd learn from it.&quot;

To launch Google 101, Bisciglia had to replicate the dynamics and a bit of
the magic of Google's cloud?but without tapping into the cloud itself or
revealing its deepest secrets. These secrets fuel endless speculation among
computer scientists. But Google keeps much under cover. This immense
computer, after all, runs the company. It automatically handles search,
places ads, churns through e-mails. The computer does the work, and
thousands of Google engineers, including Bisciglia, merely service the
machine. They teach the system new tricks or find new markets for it to
invade. And they add on new clusters?four new data centers this year alone,
at an average cost of $600 million apiece.

In building this machine, Google, so famous for search, is poised to take on
a new role in the computer industry. Not so many years ago scientists and
researchers looked to national laboratories for the cutting-edge research on
computing. Now, says Daniel Frye, vice-president of open systems development
at IBM, &quot;Google is doing the work that 10 years ago would have gone on in a
national lab.&quot;

How was Bisciglia going to give students access to this machine? The easiest
option would have been to plug his class directly into the Google computer.
But the company wasn't about to let students loose in a machine loaded with
proprietary software, brimming with personal data, and running a $10.6
billion business. So Bisciglia shopped for an affordable cluster of 40
computers. He placed the order, then set about figuring out how to pay for
the servers. While the vendor was wiring the computers together, Bisciglia
alerted a couple of Google managers that a bill was coming. Then he &quot;kind of
sent the expense report up the chain, and no one said no.&quot; He adds one of
his favorite sayings: &quot;It's far easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask
for permission.&quot; (&quot;If you're interested in someone who strictly follows the
rules, Christophe's not your guy,&quot; says Lazowska, who refers to the cluster
as &quot;a gift from heaven.&quot;)
A FRENETIC LEARNER

On Nov. 10, 2006, the rack of computers appeared at U-Dub's Computer Science
building. Bisciglia and a couple of tech administrators had to figure out
how to hoist the 1-ton rack up four stories into the server room. They
eventually made it, and then prepared for the start of classes, in January.

Bisciglia's mother, Brenda, says her son seemed marked for an unusual path
from the start. He didn't speak until age 2, and then started with
sentences. One of his first came as they were driving near their home in Gig
Harbor, Wash. A bug flew in the open window, and a voice came from the car
seat in back: &quot;Mommy, there's something artificial in my mouth.&quot;

At school, the boy's endless questions and frenetic learning pace
exasperated teachers. His parents, seeing him sad and frustrated, pulled him
out and home-schooled him for three years. Bisciglia says he missed the
company of kids during that time but developed as an entrepreneur. He had a
passion for Icelandic horses and as an adolescent went into business raising
them. Once, says his father, Jim, they drove far north into Manitoba and
bought horses, without much idea about how to transport the animals back
home. &quot;The whole trip was like a scene from one of Chevy Chase's movies,&quot; he
says. Christophe learned about computers developing Web pages for his horse
sales and his father's luxury-cruise business. And after concluding that
computers promised a brighter future than animal husbandry, he went off to
U-Dub and signed up for as many math, physics, and computer courses as he
could.

In late 2006, as he shuttled between the Googleplex and Seattle preparing
for Google 101, Bisciglia used his entrepreneurial skills to piece together
a sprawling team of volunteers. He worked with college interns to develop
the curriculum, and he dragooned a couple of Google colleagues from the
nearby Kirkland (Wash.) facility to use some of their 20% time to help him
teach it. Following Schmidt's advice, Bisciglia worked to focus Google 101
on something students could learn quickly. &quot;I was like, what's the one thing
I could teach them in two months that would be useful and really important?&quot;
he recalls. His answer was &quot;MapReduce.&quot;

Bisciglia adores MapReduce, the software at the heart of Google computing.
While the company's famous search algorithms provide the intelligence for
each search, MapReduce delivers the speed and industrial heft. It divides
each task into hundreds, or even thousands, of tasks, and distributes them
to legions of computers. In a fraction of a second, as each one comes back
with its nugget of information, MapReduce quickly assembles the responses
into an answer. Other programs do the same job. But MapReduce is faster and
appears able to handle near limitless work. When the subject comes up,
Bisciglia rhapsodizes. &quot;I remember graduating, coming to Google, learning
about MapReduce, and really just changing the way I thought about computer
science and everything,&quot; he says. He calls it &quot;a very simple, elegant
model.&quot; It was developed by another Washington alumnus, Jeffrey Dean. By
returning to U-Dub and teaching MapReduce, Bisciglia would be returning this
software &quot;and this way of thinking&quot; back to its roots.

There was only one obstacle. MapReduce was anchored securely inside Google's
machine?and it was not for outside consumption, even if the subject was
Google 101. The company did share some information about it, though, to feed
an open-source version of MapReduce called Hadoop. The idea was that,
without divulging its crown jewel, Google could push for its standard to
become the architecture of cloud computing.

The team that developed Hadoop belonged to a company, Nutch, that got
acquired. Oddly, they were now working within the walls of Yahoo, which was
counting on the MapReduce offspring to give its own computers a touch of
Google magic. Hadoop remained open source, though, which meant the Google
team could adapt it and install it for free on the U-Dub cluster.

Students rushed to sign up for Google 101 as soon as it appeared in the
winter-semester syllabus. In the beginning, Bisciglia and his Google
colleagues tried teaching. But in time they handed over the job to
professional educators at U-Dub. &quot;Their delivery is a lot clearer,&quot;
Bisciglia says. Within weeks the students were learning how to configure
their work for Google machines and designing ambitious Web-scale projects,
from cataloguing the edits on Wikipedia to crawling the Internet to identify
spam. Through the spring of 2007, as word about the course spread to other
universities, departments elsewhere started asking for Google 101.

Many were dying for cloud knowhow and computing power?especially for
scientific research. In practically every field, scientists were grappling
with vast piles of new data issuing from a host of sensors, analytic
equipment, and ever-finer measuring tools. Patterns in these troves could
point to new medicines and therapies, new forms of clean energy. They could
help predict earthquakes. But most scientists lacked the machinery to store
and sift through these digital El Dorados. &quot;We're drowning in data,&quot; said
Jeannette Wing, assistant director of the National Science Foundation.
BIG BLUE LARGESSE

The hunger for Google computing put Bisciglia in a predicament. He had been
fortunate to push through the order for the first cluster of computers.
Could he do that again and again, eventually installing mini-Google clusters
in each computer science department? Surely not. To extend Google 101 to
universities around the world, the participants needed to plug into a shared
resource. Bisciglia needed a bigger cloud.

That's when luck descended on the Googleplex in the person of IBM Chairman
Samuel J. Palmisano. This was &quot;Sam's day at Google,&quot; says an IBM researcher.
The winter day was a bit chilly for beach volleyball in the center of
campus, but Palmisano lunched on some of the fabled free cuisine in a
cafeteria. Then he and his team sat down with Schmidt and a handful of
Googlers, including Bisciglia. They drew on whiteboards and discussed cloud
computing. It was no secret that IBM wanted to deploy clouds to provide data
and services to business customers. At the same time, under Palmisano, IBM
had been a leading promoter of open-source software, including Linux. This
was a key in Big Blue's software battles, especially against Microsoft. If
Google and IBM teamed up on a cloud venture, they could construct the future
of this type of computing on Google-based standards, including Hadoop.

Google, of course, had a running start on such a project: Bisciglia's Google
101. In the course of that one day, Bisciglia's small venture morphed into a
major initiative backed at the CEO level by two tech titans. By the time
Palmisano departed that afternoon, it was established that Bisciglia and his
IBM counterpart, Dennis Quan, would build a prototype of a joint Google-IBM
university cloud.

Over the next three months they worked together at Google headquarters. (It
was around this time, Bisciglia says, that the cloud project evolved from
20% into his full-time job.) The work involved integrating IBM's business
applications and Google servers, and equipping them with a host of
open-source programs, including Hadoop. In February they unveiled the
prototype for top brass in Mountain View, Calif., and for others on video
from IBM headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. Quan wowed them by downloading data
from the cloud to his cell phone. (It wasn't relevant to the core project,
Bisciglia says, but a nice piece of theater.)

The Google 101 cloud got the green light. The plan was to spread cloud
computing first to a handful of U.S. universities within a year and later to
deploy it globally. The universities would develop the clouds, creating
tools and applications while producing legions of computer scientists to
continue building and managing them.

Those developers should be able to find jobs at a host of Web companies,
including Google. Schmidt likes to compare the data centers to the
prohibitively expensive particle accelerators known as cyclotrons. &quot;There
are only a few cyclotrons in physics,&quot; he says. &quot;And every one if them is
important, because if you're a top-flight physicist you need to be at the
lab where that cyclotron is being run. That's where history's going to be
made; that's where the inventions are going to come. So my idea is that if
you think of these as supercomputers that happen to be assembled from
smaller computers, we have the most attractive supercomputers, from a
science perspective, for people to come work on.&quot;

As the sea of business and scientific data rises, computing power turns into
a strategic resource, a form of capital. &quot;In a sense,&quot; says Yahoo Research
Chief Prabhakar Raghavan, &quot;there are only five computers on earth.&quot; He lists
Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon. Few others, he says, can turn
electricity into computing power with comparable efficiency.

All sorts of business models are sure to evolve. Google and its rivals could
team up with customers, perhaps exchanging computing power for access to
their data. They could recruit partners into their clouds for pet projects,
such as the company's clean energy initiative, announced in November. With
the electric bills at jumbo data centers running upwards of $20 million a
year, according to industry analysts, it's only natural for Google to commit
both brains and server capacity to the search for game-changing energy
breakthroughs.

What will research clouds look like? Tony Hey, vice-president for external
research at Microsoft, says they'll function as huge virtual laboratories,
with a new generation of librarians?some of them human?&quot;curating&quot; troves of
data, opening them to researchers with the right credentials. Authorized
users, he says, will build new tools, haul in data, and share it with
far-flung colleagues. In these new labs, he predicts, &quot;you may win the Nobel
prize by analyzing data assembled by someone else.&quot; Mark Dean, head of IBM's
research operation in Almaden, Calif., says that the mixture of business and
science will lead, in a few short years, to networks of clouds that will tax
our imagination. &quot;Compared to this,&quot; he says, &quot;the Web is tiny. We'll be
laughing at how small the Web is.&quot; And yet, if this &quot;tiny&quot; Web was big
enough to spawn Google and its empire, there's no telling what opportunities
could open up in the giant clouds.

It's a mid-November day at the Googleplex. A jetlagged Christophe Bisciglia
is just back from China, where he has been talking to universities about
Google 101. He's had a busy time, not only setting up the cloud with IBM but
also working out deals with six universities?U-Dub, Berkeley, Stanford, MIT,
Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Maryland?to launch it. Now he's got a
camera crew in a conference room, with wires and lights spilling over a
table. This is for a promotional video about cloud education that they'll

Eric Schmidt comes in. At 52, he is nearly twice Bisciglia's age, and his
body looks a bit padded next to his prot?g?'s willowy frame. Bisciglia
guides him to a chair across from the camera and explains the plan. They'll
tape the audio from the interview and then set up Schmidt for some
stand-alone face shots. &quot;B-footage,&quot; Bisciglia calls it. Schmidt nods and
sits down. Then he thinks better of it. He tells the cameramen to film the
whole thing and skip stand-alone shots. He and Bisciglia are far too busy to
stand around for B footage.

Extra: The Two Flavors of Google A battle could be shaping up between the
two leading software platforms for cloud computing, one proprietary and the
other open-source

Why are search engines so fast? They farm out the job to multiple
processors. Each task is a team effort, some of them involving hundreds, or
even thousands, of computers working in concert. As more businesses and
researchers shift complex data operations to clusters of computers known as
clouds, the software that orchestrates that teamwork becomes increasingly
vital. The state of the art is Google's in-house computing platform, known
as MapReduce. But Google
(GOOG&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>is keeping that gem in-house. An open-source version of MapReduce known as
Hadoop is shaping up to become the industry standard.

This means that the two leading software platforms for cloud computing could
end up being two flavors of Google, one proprietary and the
other?Hadoop?open source. And their battle for dominance could occur even
within Google's own clouds. Here's why: MapReduce is so effective because it
works exclusively inside Google, and it handles a limited menu of chores.
Its versatility is a question. If Hadoop attracts a large community of
developers, it could develop into a more versatile tool, handling a wide
variety of work, from scientific data-crunching to consumer marketing
analytics. And as it becomes a standard in university labs, young computer
scientists will emerge into the job market with Hadoop skills.
Gaining Fans

The growth of Hadoop creates a tangle of relationships in the world of
megacomputing. The core development team works inside Google's rival, Yahoo!
(YHOO&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=YHOO">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=YHOO</A>
&gt;<i>).
</I>This means that as Google and IBM
(IBM&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>put together software for their university cloud initiative, announced in
October, they will work with a Google clone developed largely by a team at
Yahoo. The tool is already gaining fans.
Facebook&lt;

&gt;<i>uses
</I>Hadoop to analyze user behavior and the effectiveness of ads on the
site, says Hadoop founder Doug Cutting, who now works at Yahoo.

In early November, for example, the tech team at The New York Times
(NYT&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=NYT">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=NYT</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>rented computing power on Amazon's
(AMZN&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AMZN">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AMZN</A>
&gt;<i>)
</I>cloud and used Hadoop to convert 11 million archived articles, dating back
to 1851, to digital and searchable documents. They turned around in a single
day a job that otherwise would have taken months.

Cutting, a 44-year-old search veteran, started developing Hadoop 18 months
ago while running the nonprofit Nutch Foundation. After he later joined
Yahoo, he says, the Hadoop project (named after his son's stuffed elephant)
was just &quot;sitting in the corner.&quot; But in short order, Yahoo saw Hadoop as a
tool to enhance the operations of its own search engine and to power its own
computing clouds.
Wider Participation

Cutting says the company's existing software &quot;is stretched thin&quot; and demands
lots of engineering attention. What's more, it's &quot;not easy to make big
changes,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not a flexible system.&quot;

Hadoop promises relief. But it is more likely to thrive, Cutting says, if
the development community grows outside of Yahoo. He says that while he and
about 10 others in Yahoo work on Hadoop, only five or six people outside of
the company contribute regularly. &quot;It's dominated by Yahoo,&quot; he says. &quot;It
would be great for the project to have a more balanced team.&quot;

The Hadoop team is not likely to get loads of help from Google. While the
search giant provides certain information about MapReduce to open-source
developers, it takes great care to prevent the secrets in its proprietary
code from leaking into Hadoop. Cutting says Google prohibits any developers
who work with MapReduce from participating in Hadoop. &quot;They assign interns
to it,&quot; he says. Google does not comment on the policy.

Sea Change Data from the deep like never before

Scientists knee-deep in data are longing for the storage capacity and power
of cloud computing. University of Washington oceanographer John R. Delaney
is one of many who are desperate to tap into it.

Delaney is putting together a $170 million project called Neptune, which
could become the prototype for a new era of data-intensive research.
Launching this year, Neptune deploys hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable
connected to thousands of sensors in the Pacific Ocean off the Washington
coast. The sensors will stream back data on the behavior of the ocean: its
temperature, light, life forms, the changing currents, chemistry, and the
physics of motion. Microphones will record the sound track of the deep sea,
from the songs of whales to the rumble of underwater volcanos.

Neptune will provide researchers with an orgy of information from the deep.
It will extend humanity's eyes and ears?and many other senses?to the
two-thirds of the planet we barely know. &quot;We've lived on Planet Land for a
long time,&quot; says Delaney, who works out of an office near Puget Sound. &quot;This
is a mission to Planet Ocean.&quot;

He describes the hidden planet as a vast matrix of relationships. Sharks,
plankton, red tides, thermal vents spewing boiling water?they're all
connected to each other, he says. And if scientists can untangle these ties,
they can start to predict how certain changes within the ocean will affect
the weather, crops, and life on earth. Later this century, he ventures,
we'll have a mathematical model of the world's oceans, and will be able to
&quot;manage&quot; them. &quot;We manage Central Park now, and the National Forests,&quot; he
says. &quot;Why not the oceans?&quot;

To turn Neptune's torrents of data into predictive intelligence, teams of
scientists from many fields will have to hunt for patterns and statistical
correlations. The laboratory for this work, says Delaney, will be &quot;gigantic
disk farms that distribute it all over the planet, just like Google
(GOOG&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GOOG</A>
&gt;<i>).&quot;
</I>In other words, Neptune, like other big science projects, needs a cloud.
Delaney doesn't yet know on which cloud Neptune will land. Without leaving
Seattle, he has Microsoft
(MSFT&lt;
<A HREF="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MSFT">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MSFT</A>

&gt;<i>)
</I>venture at his own university.

What will the work on this cloud consist of? Picture scientists calling up
comparisons from the data and then posing endless queries. In that sense,
cloud science may feel a bit like a Google search.

data centers that behave as one. These globe-spanning networks of computers
are known as &quot;clouds.&quot; They represent a new species of global supercomputer,
one that specializes in burrowing through mountains of random, unstructured
data at lightning speed. Scientists are hungry for this kind of computing.

&gt;<i>)
</I>to extend Google-style cloud computing to the entire world. The project
begins with a pilot program in six universities.

*On cloud computing:*

What [cloud computing] has come to mean now is a synonym for the return of
the mainframe. It used to be that mainframes had all of the data. You had
these relatively dumb terminals. In the PC period, the PC took over a lot of
that functionality, which is great. We now have the return of the mainframe,
and the mainframe is a set of computers. You never visit them, you never see
them. But they're out there. They're in a cloud somewhere. They're in the
sky, and they're always around. That's roughly the metaphor.

*On Google's place in cloud computing:*

Google is a cloud computing server, and in fact we are spending billions of
dollars?this is public information?to build data centers, which are in one
sense a return to the mainframe. In another sense, they're one large
supercomputer. And in another sense, they are the cloud itself.

So Google aspires to be a large portion of the cloud, or a cloud that you
would interact with every day. Why would Google want to do that? Well,
because we're particularly good at high-speed data and data computation.

*On Google's software edge:*

Google is so fast because more than one computer is working on your query.
It farms out your question, if you will, to on the order of 25 computers. It
says, &quot;You guys look over here for some answers, you guys look over here for
some answers.&quot; And then the answers come back very quickly. It then
organizes it to a single answer. You can't tell which computer gave you the
answer.

*On the size of cloud computing:*

There's no limit. The reason Google is investing so much in very-high-speed
data is because we see this explosion, essentially digital data multimedia
explosion, as infinitely larger than people are talking about today.
Everything can be measured, sensed, tracked in real time.

*On applications that run on a cloud:*

Let's look at Google Earth. You can think of the cloud and the servers that
provide Google Earth as a platform for applications. The term we use is
location-based services. Here's a simple example. Everyone here has cell
phones with GPS and a camera. Imagine if all of a sudden there were a mobile
phone which took picture after picture after picture, and posted it to
Google Earth about what's going on in the world. Now is that interesting, or
will it produce enormous amounts of noise? My guess is that it'll be a lot
of noise.

So then we'll have to design algorithms that will sort through to find the
things that are interesting or special, which is yet another need for cloud
computing. One of the problems is you have these large collections coming
in, and they have relatively high noise to value. In our world, it's a
search problem.

*On Google becoming a giant of computing:*

This is our goal. We're doing it because the applications actually need
these services. A typical example is that you're a Gmail user. Most people's
attachments are megabytes long, because they're attaching everything plus
the kitchen sink, and they're using Gmail for transporting random bags of
bits. That's the problem of scale. But from a Google perspective, it
provides significant barriers to entry against our competitors, except for
the very well-funded ones.

I like to think of [the data centers] as cyclotrons. There are only a few
cyclotrons in physics and every one of them is important, because if you're
a top flight physicist you need to be at the lab where that cyclotron is
being run because that's where history's going to be made, that's where the
inventions are going to come from. So my idea is that if you think of these
as supercomputers that happen to be assembled from smaller computers, we
have the most attractive supercomputers, from a science perspective, for
people to come work on.

*On the Google-IBM education project:*

Universities were having trouble participating in this phenomenon [cloud
computing] because they couldn't afford the billions of dollars it takes to
build these enormous facilities. So [Christophe Bisciglia] figured out a way
to get a smaller version of what we're doing into the curriculum, which is
clearly positive from our perspective, because it gets the concepts out. But
it also whets the appetite for people to say, &quot;Hey, I want 10,000
computers,&quot; as opposed to 100.

*On meeting young engineers who talk to him about their 20% time projects
(where Google employees are given time to work on their own projects):*

You basically never know when you're going to meet the next Christophe. They
might show up in the parking lot. They might show up on the walk. Here's an
example. Somebody walks up to me and starts showing me this demo. It was in
AdSense, and all of a sudden I realize that he had invented a billion-dollar
business. I'd rather not go into the specifics. And I said, &quot;How long have
you been working on this?&quot; He was like, &quot;Oh, you know, about a month.&quot; I
said, &quot;Is this your 20% time? Have you told anyone about it?&quot; He said,
&quot;Yeah, I was going to tell my manager, but I was afraid he'd tell me to
stop.&quot; And I said, &quot;Let me talk to the manager.&quot; This project really has
potential for some really significant applications in the advertising world.


*On other favorite 20% projects:*

My favorite one is spelling correction. It's a bizarre story. The fellow, an
undergraduate at Berkeley, wasn't quite sure what he wanted to do. He
interviewed O.K., was obviously brilliant, kind of unfocused. He comes in,
hangs out with his friends, and says, &quot;Why don't we apply artificial
intelligence technology to spell correction?&quot; So he invents, by himself, the
spelling corrector we use today. The algorithm that he invented has been
explained to me, by him, by others, a couple of times, and I still don't
really understand it. It's magic. Magic is science insufficiently explained.
