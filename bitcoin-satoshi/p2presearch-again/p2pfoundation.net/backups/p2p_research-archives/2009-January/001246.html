</I>&gt;<i> Dear David and Alan,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just a quick remark about my opinion that both david's and my
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation may be compatible with what you say here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me explain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) tribal hunter-gathering societies start with CS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) as they get more complex and inter-related in to 'tribal societies' with
</I>&gt;<i> surpluses and chiefs etc ... AR and EM kick in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that in this case, AR is political authority, but not the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical allocation of resources that we have i later class based
</I>&gt;<i> societies, and that EM is the mechanism for inter-clan and inter-tribal
</I>&gt;<i> 'economic' exchange ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view, this is the literature I have been reading, and which describes
</I>&gt;<i> this particular stage of developed tribal society, before the consolidated
</I>&gt;<i> class societies kick in,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (that EM would become dominant only after manufacturing is something I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot square with any ofthe gift literature I have been reading and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> make any sense to me at the moment)

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Michel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your query.  Although I'm not an expert on economic
</I>&gt;<i> anthropology, I think it's clear that it's crucial to distinguish between
</I>&gt;<i> two types of  'tribal' societies: First there are subsistence hunting and
</I>&gt;<i> gathering societies, which have little or no stored surplus.  Although it's
</I>&gt;<i> a big generalization, the dominant principle for production and exchange in
</I>&gt;<i> these foraging communities is usually CS; they are often strongly anti-AR.
</I>&gt;<i> Second, there are a few hunting and gathering societies with stored
</I>&gt;<i> surpluses and there are agriculture-based socities, in which AR is prominent
</I>&gt;<i> (institutionalized and more or less heridtary chiefs and then kings) and
</I>&gt;<i> there are varying degrees of EM.  In socities based predominantly on
</I>&gt;<i> pastoralism, communities are much more fluid, but AR is also prominent.  MP
</I>&gt;<i> also very gradually emerges in agricultural societies, but pastoral
</I>&gt;<i> societies are often resistent and opposed to MP.  EM seems to become more
</I>&gt;<i> dominant at a much later stage, with the rise of manufacturing, perhaps.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, MP continues to expand right up to the present, but the mix gets
</I>&gt;<i> complex!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best overview of these stages (although it doesn't use RMT) is Allen
</I>&gt;<i> Johnson and Timothy Earle, 2000,  *The Evolution of Human Societies: From
</I>&gt;<i> Foraging Group to Agrarian State,* Second Edition.  It's not elegantly
</I>&gt;<i> written or tightly reasoned, but I believe they've got the facts right.
</I>&gt;<i>  (However, look at the reviews to see what other experts have to say; I
</I>&gt;<i> don't follow this literature particularly.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, no society relies exclusively on one or even two models.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'm delighted to see that you've treated my timn work well.  yes, i had
</I>&gt;<i> spotted  your postings about it.  that's partly why i decided to include
</I>&gt;<i> your name on my latest send-around: the cyboc paper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> your email raises a lot of theoretical points, more than i can handle right
</I>&gt;<i> now.  maybe later, because this is all very interesting, and we are seeking
</I>&gt;<i> in rather similar directions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but i do have one  comment that i can offer quickly enough.  it's about
</I>&gt;<i> fiske's framework.  there is some overlap  with  timn, but not exactly.  i
</I>&gt;<i> briefly explain this in a 2006 study you may not have seen yet that focuses
</I>&gt;<i> on the tribal (t) form, but also contains material on the other timn forms
</I>&gt;<i> (see url below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my take on fiske is different from your own.  you equate the tribal form
</I>&gt;<i> with equality-matching, but i equate it to his communal-sharing form.  you
</I>&gt;<i> think his communal-sharing form matches p2p nicely.  in my view, none of his
</I>&gt;<i> forms match the network form the way i'd like.  here's what i say there:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        &quot;One psychologist (Fiske, 1993) posits that all social relationships
</I>&gt;<i> reduce to four forms of interaction:  communal sharing, authority ranking,
</I>&gt;<i> equality matching, and market pricing.  People develop their capacities for
</I>&gt;<i> social interaction in that order, from infancy through early childhood.  The
</I>&gt;<i> sharing, ranking, and pricing forms correspond to the tribal, hierarchical,
</I>&gt;<i> and market forms, respectively.  The equality-matching form, which is mainly
</I>&gt;<i> about equal-status peer-group behavior, does not correspond to any single
</I>&gt;<i> form; it has some attributes that fit under network form, but other
</I>&gt;<i> attributes (e.g., reciprocity, feuding, revenge) fit better under the tribal
</I>&gt;<i> form.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        the url for this (including for .pdf download) is:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WR433/">http://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WR433/</A>  (Social Forms, 2006)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a deeper issue here is whether the tribal and the network forms are all
</I>&gt;<i> that different.  i think they are.  and i'd like them to be so.  i write
</I>&gt;<i> several pages about this.   but as i note, if it turns out that the new
</I>&gt;<i> network form is an upgraded version of the old tribal form, then the timn
</I>&gt;<i> framework should be converted into a three-form framework, and what will
</I>&gt;<i> come next later in spiral fashion is an upgraded version of the hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> form.  hmm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> onward.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm using a very similar scheme from Alan Page Fiske, which I think is
</I>&gt;<i> totally congruent with yours, it's just that instead of taking a view of the
</I>&gt;<i> social formations, he takes a view of the relational dynamics as the
</I>&gt;<i> starting point, as do I.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Relational_Model_Typology_-_Fiske">http://p2pfoundation.net/Relational_Model_Typology_-_Fiske</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main idea then, is that history starts with a equality matching (gift
</I>&gt;<i> economies of the tribal period) (TRIBES), the hierarchical allocation of
</I>&gt;<i> authority ranking (INSTITUTIONS), the market pricing dynamic (MARKETS) and
</I>&gt;<i> communal shareholding (NETWORKS)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each relational dynamic has always existed, but there seem be successive
</I>&gt;<i> historical epochs where they are dominant, and therefore dominate the form
</I>&gt;<i> of society, including the other relational logics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess an important question would be how much you would see your vision
</I>&gt;<i> of networks as indeed dominated by the communal shareholding logic, but this
</I>&gt;<i> issue could be solved by recognizing different network typologies as well,
</I>&gt;<i> and obviously, I would then be talking about a particular format of networks
</I>&gt;<i> that arises around the CS dynamic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If such changes do indeed occur in history, and these indeed occur over the
</I>&gt;<i> very long term (centuries), then we would expect:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) a first phase in which the old dominant format (say Tribes adapting to
</I>&gt;<i> the early forms of tributary power), absorbs the new format, and can even
</I>&gt;<i> use it for strengthening itself. So today, the markets would absorb the p2p
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic, as would the state form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) in a second phase they would exist uneasily together, eventually forming
</I>&gt;<i> an unstable parity (I'm thinking of 18th century Europe, or the 5 to 10th
</I>&gt;<i> century transition from slavery to feudalism)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) in a third phase though, the emerging form would start to become
</I>&gt;<i> dominant and in turn, the other forms would start to adapt to the new
</I>&gt;<i> meta-logic and meta-system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that were true, and that is my thesis, then, we would eventually have a
</I>&gt;<i> p2p-network based logic society, but co-existing with peer-informed or
</I>&gt;<i> peer-transformed tribes, institutions, and markets, to use ure TIMN
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is of course speculation, and in any case, we are now in the emerging
</I>&gt;<i> phase of peer to peer logics coming to the fore, which means that the old
</I>&gt;<i> forms are indeed using them to strenghtem themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the Obama campaign is the first to successfully
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentalize the p2p dynamics of social networks, for its own aims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we have a top-down logic (a group wanting dominance in the institutional
</I>&gt;<i> field), using the new forms, but at the same time, the new forms, however
</I>&gt;<i> emergent, also exist on their own, and have their own logic and strenght and
</I>&gt;<i> a mutual adaptation arises, in which the instrumentalizing party (Obama),
</I>&gt;<i> needs to adapt just as much as do the social networks they are mobilizing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we need to be clear about what networks we are talking about
</I>&gt;<i> (centralized, decentralized, distributed), since p2p, as voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> aggegation around the production of common value, only pertains to
</I>&gt;<i> distributed networks, or to hybrid ones in which the distributed element
</I>&gt;<i> remains strong enough not to disallow the self-aggregation to occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would make a strong claim, and we may differ on our vision of temporality
</I>&gt;<i> here, as in our reliance on scholarship, that we are in the midst of a rapid
</I>&gt;<i> cristallisation of the new logics, that are taken an institutional form
</I>&gt;<i> already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no time to do this now, but amongst the 200+ items here at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/category/p2p-governance,">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/category/p2p-governance,</A> I summarized about
</I>&gt;<i> a dozen (or more), serious academic studies of how this format already
</I>&gt;<i> operates around free software/FLOSS production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I discuss this more thoroughly in: The social web and its social contracts.
</I>&gt;<i> Re-public, . Retrieved from <A HREF="http://www.re-public.gr/en/?p=261">http://www.re-public.gr/en/?p=261</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here a summary of the main ideas and hypotheses:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It usually takes a triarchical form:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) a self-aggregating community governed through peer governance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) a new kind of NPO/NGO (misleading terms here because they imply
</I>&gt;<i> derivation from the other 2 forms), which I call 'for-benefit institutions',
</I>&gt;<i> which govern the infrastructure of cooperation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) a business ecology of corporates, operating in the market but practising
</I>&gt;<i> benefit sharing with the 2 other players, see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Benefit_Sharing">http://p2pfoundation.net/Benefit_Sharing</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two important points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the community-corporate dynamic gives rise to a ladder of participation
</I>&gt;<i> giving rise to practices that may be dominated by either pole, but are
</I>&gt;<i> rarely ever totally controlled by either party
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the for-benefit institutions (<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/For_Benefit">http://p2pfoundation.net/For_Benefit</A>),
</I>&gt;<i> such as the open source software foundations (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Software_Foundations">http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Software_Foundations</A>) differ
</I>&gt;<i> SIGNIFICANTLY from the older format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason is that they exist to support the community logic, and do not
</I>&gt;<i> command and control the community. Internally, they have skeleton staffs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this can be understood by looking at the abundance/scarcity
</I>&gt;<i> polarity, with the new institutional formats only taking care of the
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity-driven infrastructure of cooperation, while the community functions
</I>&gt;<i> differently on the abundance logic of sharing immaterial goods according to
</I>&gt;<i> the p2p relational logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The important thing though is that we have an observable logic at play,
</I>&gt;<i> even as it is early days. And what we see is that this same logic is now
</I>&gt;<i> being exported to the design of material things (<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/">http://p2pfoundation.net</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> , in combination with more distributed manufacturing (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Manufacturing">http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Manufacturing</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the design is immaterial, I content,  based on observation, that
</I>&gt;<i> the same triarchical structure seems to be operating as peer production
</I>&gt;<i> moves to that new sphere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of the latter though, there is no scholarly material available as yet, as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I know, but we cannot possibly wait for the slow grinding academic
</I>&gt;<i> world, and we need hybrid outfits such as ours, which can at least present
</I>&gt;<i> the raw material for further study, and offer grounded, but non-academic,
</I>&gt;<i> speculations on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One further step needs to be considered. Is peer production limited to 'an
</I>&gt;<i> aspect of the economy'. No no no!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Self-aggregation works across all social fields, and so we can say that
</I>&gt;<i> social networks are peer producing politics as well, and that this may
</I>&gt;<i> exhibit the same triarchical logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example: self-aggregating communities of Obama sympathizers, more
</I>&gt;<i> formal institutions (such as Move.on etc..) which function as platforms BUT
</I>&gt;<i> WHICH DO NOT DIRECT the peer production, and institutions, such as the Obama
</I>&gt;<i> campaign, which attempt to extract institutional value from it (electoral
</I>&gt;<i> victory translating into power).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to make my point clear, what I would have liked to see in the
</I>&gt;<i> Postscript, is not just a phrase allowing for this dynamic, but a more
</I>&gt;<i> serious consideration of this very specific network logic, the p2p network
</I>&gt;<i> logic and its already observable transformative effects.

</I>&gt;<i> network forms of organization, including &quot;p2p&quot; (though I have previously
</I>&gt;<i> preferred the term &quot;all-channel&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I saw you refer to &quot;peer production&quot; (a la Benkler?), as found among
</I>&gt;<i> open-source undertakings for software development and file-sharing.  Well,
</I>&gt;<i> that we do not attend to.  I view it mostly as an innovation in a part of
</I>&gt;<i> the economy -- one that engages a proposition for my TIMN effort, and I'd
</I>&gt;<i> rather take it up when I get around to doing the rise-of-markets chapter for
</I>&gt;<i> that study.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [See below for a reminder of what TIMN is about.  The proposition is that
</I>&gt;<i> the rise of a new form (and its realm) has effects that modify the existing
</I>&gt;<i> forms/realms.  Thus, state hierarchies get modified by market principles to
</I>&gt;<i> generate liberal democracies.  Today, capitalist markets are being modified
</I>&gt;<i> by network principles to generate new modes of social production.  But I
</I>&gt;<i> digress.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I finally spotted that you were mainly referring to &quot;peer-governed
</I>&gt;<i> civil-society networks&quot; that include newer kinds of entities than just NGOs
</I>&gt;<i> and NPOs.  Hmmm.  Well, the paper does repeatedly emphasize NGOs and NPOs,
</I>&gt;<i> partly for shorthand reasons, and it wouldn't have taken much extra space to
</I>&gt;<i> add epistemic communities, virtual associations, and other new network
</I>&gt;<i> entities to the picture, not to mention individuals, as we have done in
</I>&gt;<i> other writings.  Moreover, on review, I see I left out a phrase I've used in
</I>&gt;<i> the past to help cover such possibilities, by referring to the emergence
</I>&gt;<i> from civil society &quot;of a new network-based realm whose name and nature are
</I>&gt;<i> not yet known.&quot;  I'm certainly not supposing that all of civil society will
</I>&gt;<i> fold into this new realm.  Maybe Danielle and I can edit for all this before
</I>&gt;<i> long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I try to keep an eye out for innovative entities and networks that
</I>&gt;<i> transcend existing NGO/NPO-related categories.  But I've not spotted a lot
</I>&gt;<i> yet, even less when it comes to durable new entities that would be of
</I>&gt;<i> interest to policymakers and could participate in governance programs.  It
</I>&gt;<i> will be interesting to see what happens to the &quot;Obama network&quot; in this
</I>&gt;<i> regard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Amid all this, you found our second section in the Postscript
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;disappointing, as a third nonprofit sector already existed.&quot;  Well, yes, it
</I>&gt;<i> has kind of existed for a little over a decade or so.  But that isn't long.
</I>&gt;<i>  Researchers didn't make much of it as a social or third sector until the
</I>&gt;<i> 1980s-90s (see our citations).  Policymakers still aren't sure about it,
</I>&gt;<i> from what I've seen.  Our point is that its significance will be for sure
</I>&gt;<i> when policy dialogue shifts -- when it moves beyond the standard
</I>&gt;<i> public-private, government-or-market categorizing, and engages a language
</I>&gt;<i> that means going in distinctly new directions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later, you claim we have a &quot;top-down bias.&quot;  But in fact, there is lots of
</I>&gt;<i> room -- and need -- for bottom-up as well as side-to-side structures and
</I>&gt;<i> processes in our vision.  This is most evident in the section on sensory
</I>&gt;<i> apparatuses, as in our references to sousveillance and collective
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence.  However, your comment is aimed at the section on networked
</I>&gt;<i> governance.  There we observe that hierarchy will persist; it is essential
</I>&gt;<i> to some degree for states. But, even in the quote you use as an example of
</I>&gt;<i> top-down bias, what we look forward to seeing are more networked
</I>&gt;<i> partnerships between state and other actors.  I figured it would be implicit
</I>&gt;<i> that such networks would not have to be top-down hierarchical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you have a deeper critique in mind, akin to Kevin Carson's
</I>&gt;<i> interesting comments aspiring for p2p networks and p2p governance to
</I>&gt;<i> displace hierarchies (not to mention markets too) as a main form of social
</I>&gt;<i> organization.  That networks are gaining ground relative to hierarchies and
</I>&gt;<i> markets has been a key theme in my work for many years, esp. in writings
</I>&gt;<i> with John Arquilla.  We have even helped argue that networks can outfight
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies in some circumstances.  But it is quite another matter to
</I>&gt;<i> suppose that, over the long run, hierarchies (or markets) are goners, and
</I>&gt;<i> networks their entirely preferable successors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My theoretical stance stems from trying to figure out the TIMN framework
</I>&gt;<i> and what it means for social evolution.  As you may recall, it concerns how
</I>&gt;<i> societies have developed four major forms of organization -- tribes,
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical institutions, markets, and networks -- and combined them (and
</I>&gt;<i> their resulting realms) in a prefered progression that takes centuries to
</I>&gt;<i> evolve:  from monoform T, to biform T+I, to triform T+I+M, and next to
</I>&gt;<i> quadraform T+I+M+N societies.  As I see it, one of the underlying principles
</I>&gt;<i> for success is balance:  Each form, as it arises, is essential.  For
</I>&gt;<i> societies to achieve higher levels of systemic complexity, no form (or the
</I>&gt;<i> realm it creates) should be allowed to dominate any other; some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> balance and equilibrium should be built among these inherently contradictory
</I>&gt;<i> forms and their realms.  If correct, I regard that as science, not bias.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to get back to working on this framework soon.  Our cyberocracy
</I>&gt;<i> paper relates to it, but I never meant for it to be a major endeavor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One advantage of posting and sharing via SSRN is that the paper is not
</I>&gt;<i> firmly published.  After we see what other comments roll in, we could revise
</I>&gt;<i> and repost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I commend you on the material here on your blog.  I've spent more time than
</I>&gt;<i> before in browsing it, and I'm impressed.  I'm also pleased that you've
</I>&gt;<i> helped circulate our paper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are my personal, independent views (and Danielle's may differ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Onward.
