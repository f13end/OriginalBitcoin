<PRE>Franz

If it takes Jill 5MJ to grow the same quantity of apples that take Tom 10MJ
then Jill is an outlier as far as energy conservation, which means that she
had put energy/money into acquiring or building more efficient energy
production, so what would seem like 5MJ in profit relative to Tom is in fact
a recouping of her continuous investment in more efficient energy
production.

Let's say there are 3,000 small-scale apple growers in a given community.

They all use demand-matched, predictive inventory, so they never produce
more than is in demand. That's covered in the last paragraph of Price
Registry in the model's description:

&quot;In order for producers to minimize their losses, they must adopt a model of
sustainable abundance in their production, which involves using renewable
energy and renewable resources as well as a predictive inventory to match
supply to demand to eliminate loss to themselves due to over-production. &quot;

Those 3,000 apple growers submit their joule estimates for growing an apple,
using certain easy to understand (multiple choice) settings (e.g. do they
hand pick or machine pick the apples, do they carry the apples to market on
donkey or by truck, how costly is their irrigation method, etc) built into
the estimation software.

The average or median from all cost submissions (by those 3,000 growers)
becomes the &quot;cost&quot; in Price Registry for apples.

I can work out the detailed model for collective price setting so that it's
realistic as well as practical.

The key thing here is that the joule tokens have an absolute value in energy
(spent) whereas the existing currency does not. Therefore, we have something
different here and it's possible thru the use of simple statistics to figure
out how collective price setting would work.

This is what we will test during the simulation...

People are not animals to be fed to lay their eggs or produce milk. People
need a sense of fairness and appreciation. If I spend 500MJ making something
that I would like to give to the world then I better get that 500MJ back
somehow (most efficient way is direct exchange) and if I'm paid back 600MJ
or 350MJ then I will have an idea if I'm producing the thing efficiently or
inefficiently, so this model promotes more and more efficiency, not more and
more scarcity.

I'll add these arguments to the Price Registry section later today.

You can find the whole model description here:
