&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was updating an article I had written in 2006 about Google's
</I>&gt;<i> then-emerging status as a monopoly-by-innovation (which to this remains as
</I>&gt;<i> the #1 search result when people type any combination of keywords containing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;google&quot; and &quot;monopoly&quot; on google.com) and I started thinking of Google's
</I>&gt;<i> recent launch of their own browser and more recently offline versions of
</I>&gt;<i> their online applications (e.g. Gmail offline) and if that means anything to
</I>&gt;<i> the P2P movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've known for some time now that it's easily possible for Google to build
</I>&gt;<i> into their browser certain key P2P capabilities for application developers
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. secure, reliable UDP protocol, DHT) that depend on some of their
</I>&gt;<i> centralized services like Google Account, Google Friend Connect, BigTable,
</I>&gt;<i> etc, thereby making popular P2P application development dependent on their
</I>&gt;<i> services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In updating the &quot;Is Google a Monopoly?&quot; article I have not spectualted
</I>&gt;<i> about Google's recent moves in the context of P2P but I have started to
</I>&gt;<i> think about it and how a grassroot technology like P2P can be used to extend
</I>&gt;<i> the power of those already in control (like Google.) ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, I have not made up my mind as to whether a Google developed 'open
</I>&gt;<i> source' P2P-Enabling Platform would be a bad thing. I think anything that
</I>&gt;<i> extends the power of those who already have too much power is a bad thing,
</I>&gt;<i> but at the same time the fact that we don't see many P2P-enabled
</I>&gt;<i> applications (i.e. PC to PC, not web based) points to the difficulty of
</I>&gt;<i> developing such applications, which I can summarize if anyone is
</I>&gt;<i> interested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I really can't say if that's where they're going for sure. I just know
</I>&gt;<i> that they CAN go there if they wish, at any time, and I haven't figured out
</I>&gt;<i> how I should feel about it, but I'm generally of the opinion that growing
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on one company or supplier is a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The article in question remains #1 on Google's search results (for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;monopoly&quot; AND &quot;google&quot;) 3 years after it was written despite recent
</I>&gt;<i> articles from Washington post and CNN about the same subject, which is a
</I>&gt;<i> little strange since the article barely gets more than 5 hits a day.

</I>&gt;<i> (first published on July 10th, 2006, updated Jan 27, 2009)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the growing feeling that Google holds too much power over the future
</I>&gt;<i> of the Web, without any proof that they can use that power for real change,
</I>&gt;<i> and with sufficient proof of their true character as a profit seeking
</I>&gt;<i> entity, that has put profits ahead of morals1, it is easy to see why some
</I>&gt;<i> of us are growing increasingly concerned about Google's drive to embed
</I>&gt;<i> itself in all aspects of the Web and our lives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the software industry, economies of scale do not derive from production
</I>&gt;<i> capacity but rather from the size of the installed user base, and that's
</I>&gt;<i> because software is made of electrical pulses that can be replicated in bits
</I>&gt;<i> and downloaded by the users, at a relatively small cost to the producer.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that the size of the installed user base replaces production
</I>&gt;<i> capacity in classical economic terms. The exception to this observation is
</I>&gt;<i> software that can be used from within a standard Web browser, e.g.  Google
</I>&gt;<i> search.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far Google has been building its dominant market share in search based
</I>&gt;<i> mostly on the strength of their technology, and not by leveraging an
</I>&gt;<i> installed base as Microsoft had done, so they were not considered an actual
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this is changing as Google leverages its 80% market share and
</I>&gt;<i> brand to move into the browser space, first by funding Firefox (where Google
</I>&gt;<i> search is the default search engine) and now by launching their own browser,
</I>&gt;<i> Google Chrome, which uses Google as the default search engine, and, more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, provides a platform for Google services which are beginning to
</I>&gt;<i> be available in both online versions, e.g. Google search, Gmail, Google
</I>&gt;<i> Apps, and offline versions, e.g.: Gmail Offline, which was just announced
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday, and presumably others in the future.  This represents a fork in
</I>&gt;<i> the road for the Web, with Google moving to leverage its dominant market
</I>&gt;<i> share and brand to created an installed base (just as Microsoft had done
</I>&gt;<i> with Windows) on the desktop and mobile devices (see: Google Android, and,
</I>&gt;<i> more specifically, the anticipated Google Chrome for Android,) with which it
</I>&gt;<i> can dominate every application category it wishes to dominate, just as
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft did with MS Office in the office productivity space, which
</I>&gt;<i> strangled Corel's Wordperfect, Lotus 1-2-3 and similar competing products.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, Google's move into the browser and offline application space, which
</I>&gt;<i> happened almost at once, is troubling in that it gives Google the same
</I>&gt;<i> position Microsoft had with Windows on the desktop, which it established
</I>&gt;<i> through illegal agreements with PC manufacturers, and for which it was fined
</I>&gt;<i> in the billions of dollars. So while the means by which Google is securing
</I>&gt;<i> this unfair position is legal, i.e. by leveraging its market share and
</I>&gt;<i> brand, the advantage itself remains an unfair one, with the consequence
</I>&gt;<i> being that Google is working to dominate the the mobile phone, the desktop
</I>&gt;<i> and the Web, which would greatly stifle innovation, which depends strongly
</I>&gt;<i> on the existence of a diverse and healthy market with many producers,
</I>&gt;<i> without any one producer having an unfair position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For companies competing against Google , it's not any better or worse than
</I>&gt;<i> it used to be under the Microsoft monopoly for companies that have to
</I>&gt;<i> compete with Google .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it's much worse for us the people because what is at stake now is much
</I>&gt;<i> bigger. It's no longer about our PCs and LANs, it's about the future of the
</I>&gt;<i> entire Web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could argue that the patent system protects smaller companies from
</I>&gt;<i> having their products and innovations copied and co-opted by bigger
</I>&gt;<i> competitors like Google. However, during the Microsoft dominated era, very
</I>&gt;<i> few companies succeeded in suing them for patent infringement. I happen to
</I>&gt;<i> know of one former PC software company and their ex CEO who succeeded in
</I>&gt;<i> suing Microsoft for $120M. But that's a rare exception to a common rule: the
</I>&gt;<i> one with the deeper pockets always has the advantage in court (they can drag
</I>&gt;<i> the lawsuit for years and make it too costly for others to sue them.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, given that Google is perceived as a growing monopoly, which many see
</I>&gt;<i> as having acquired too much power, too fast, without the wisdom to use that
</I>&gt;<i> power responsibly, I'm not too surprised, in retrospect, that so many people
</I>&gt;<i> had welcomed the Web 3.0 &lt;<A HREF="http://evolvingtrends.wordpress.com/web-30/">http://evolvingtrends.wordpress.com/web-30/</A>&gt;vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What leaps to mind as far as Google's lack of wisdom is their
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation with the Chinese government, not in something positive and of
</I>&gt;<i> benefit to the people, but in oppressing the already-oppressed (see: Google
</I>&gt;<i> Chinese censorship.)
