</I>&gt;<i> Six Anti-Theses on WikiLeaks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Following &quot;Twelve theses on WikiLeaks&quot; by Geert Lovink &amp; Patrice Riemens
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Wikileaks exposes the slippery moralism of global capital.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The corporate abdication of non-discrimination prefigures more
</I>&gt;<i> scrutiny of online activity. Visa, Amazon, Mastercard, Tableau,
</I>&gt;<i> PayPal, PostFinance, and EveryDNS: each severed their relationship
</I>&gt;<i> with one or more aspects of the WikiLeaks organization due to
</I>&gt;<i> technicalities. None were served with legal documents requiring
</I>&gt;<i> that they stop supporting &quot;illegal&quot; activity; rather, some caved
</I>&gt;<i> due to vague public and private requests by functionaries within
</I>&gt;<i> US government offices. Yet, these business have no moral qualms as
</I>&gt;<i> to provide similar services to the Ku Klux clan, homophobic sites
</I>&gt;<i> and just about anything else. As to the decision to cut Wikileaks
</I>&gt;<i> off they justified their actions via the legalese of their Terms of
</I>&gt;<i> Service (ToS) or Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), contracts that we all
</I>&gt;<i> accept as the necessary evil of using free services online. AUPs,
</I>&gt;<i> once the interest of legal scholars or small actors who fell afoul
</I>&gt;<i> of them, now become the prime means for ending of services to the
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable. (Recall, for example, Facebooks' threat of legal action
</I>&gt;<i> against the seppukoo project. This is a refrain that continues to
</I>&gt;<i> haunt the online space; however it was never seen with such vehemence
</I>&gt;<i> as with WikiLeaks.) Yet in a truism, this does not only eliminate the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of online activity, for the actions of Visa, Mastercard,
</I>&gt;<i> and PayPal prevent the flow of electronic currency to WikiLeaks,
</I>&gt;<i> requiring the organization to ask for either bank transfers (that
</I>&gt;<i> are prohibitively expensive for people in the US) or paper money
</I>&gt;<i> orders sent to a physical address. These actions by financial
</I>&gt;<i> institutions foreground the linkage between online activities and
</I>&gt;<i> their real reliance on forms of money that are still tied to large
</I>&gt;<i> corporations. As well, the use of contractual language to engage in
</I>&gt;<i> corporate censorship enables what is prohibited by US Constitutional
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees, among other legal safeguards elsewhere in the world.
</I>&gt;<i> Given the tiered nature of the internet---in that a hosting provider
</I>&gt;<i> purchases bandwidth from a separate company, that probably purchases
</I>&gt;<i> DNS service from a separate company---means that any activity can be
</I>&gt;<i> forced offline by any intermediary if found to be in violation of
</I>&gt;<i> the ToS. While you may have legal recourse via a civil suit, such an
</I>&gt;<i> undertaking is oftentimes impossible due to the legal costs involved
</I>&gt;<i> and the vastly unequal power differential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Wikileaks draws on the tense affair between the antiauthoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> ethos of hacker culture and the authoritarian logic of capital, also
</I>&gt;<i> known as neoliberalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WikiLeaks found a characteristically computational way around their
</I>&gt;<i> hosting problems, drawing on an unorganized group of volunteers to
</I>&gt;<i> provide mirrors of the site (<A HREF="http://wikileaks.ch/mirrors.html">http://wikileaks.ch/mirrors.html</A>). This
</I>&gt;<i> strategy of providing mirrors for content hearkens back to 1990s
</I>&gt;<i> internet culture, where the practice of setting up FTP mirrors was
</I>&gt;<i> commonplace (hacker culture itself is situated in the 1940s, see
</I>&gt;<i> Steven Levy). Mirroring mitigates the impact of corporate censorship
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat, but is likely to be impractical on a large scale in the
</I>&gt;<i> long-term, especially for all of the worthwhile projects that can be
</I>&gt;<i> removed by intermediaries. Nevertheless, this example of mirroring is
</I>&gt;<i> an interesting case of hackers relaxing their security mindset for
</I>&gt;<i> what they perceive as a greater good. Setting up a WikiLeaks mirror
</I>&gt;<i> requires the administrator to allow a member of WikiLeaks remote
</I>&gt;<i> access to their server in order to upload new files as needed; this
</I>&gt;<i> is made possible using public-key encryption techniques, the focus
</I>&gt;<i> of much hacker attention in the 1990s. Usually system administrators
</I>&gt;<i> would never open their servers for unknown people to upload files.
</I>&gt;<i> But there seems to be a belief here that the sysadmins of WikiLeaks,
</I>&gt;<i> whomever they are, will not abuse their power and will only upload
</I>&gt;<i> what they say they will upload. There is something here that deserves
</I>&gt;<i> greater scrutiny, especially in light of what Mathieu O'Neil calls
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hacker charismatic authority&quot;. Most studies consider this as a form
</I>&gt;<i> of authority _over_ people; in this case, however, the authority is
</I>&gt;<i> exercised _amongst_ sysadmins, enabling them to open their machines to
</I>&gt;<i> the unknown WikiLeaks administrators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Wikileaks shows that any system is vulnerable to infiltration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WikiLeaks is highly collaborative, and not only as a result of the
</I>&gt;<i> recent mirroring activity. Indeed, the project is only possible due
</I>&gt;<i> to their collaboration with the individuals and groups providing
</I>&gt;<i> the content to be leaked. Throughout the recent consternation over
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Cablegate&quot;, the hundreds, if not thousands, of other people who
</I>&gt;<i> have put their lives on the line to pass documents to WikiLeaks have
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately been forgotten, Bradley Manning excluded. To ignore
</I>&gt;<i> these people is to make a grave analytical error. Be thankful that we
</I>&gt;<i> do not know their names, for if we did, they would be in immediate
</I>&gt;<i> danger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Wikileaks demonstrates that the human 'factor' is the weak spot of
</I>&gt;<i> networks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Cablegate&quot; release also shows the importance of having
</I>&gt;<i> collaborators within governmental and military institutions. If we
</I>&gt;<i> assume that Manning is the source of the diplomatic and military
</I>&gt;<i> cables---and this has not been proven yet---then we can see how
</I>&gt;<i> individuals within these organizations are disgusted with the conduct
</I>&gt;<i> of the war. This is of a piece with other projects such as Iraq
</I>&gt;<i> Veterans Against the War and the War Veteran's Book Project that aim
</I>&gt;<i> to present the personal side of the present conflicts in Iraq and
</I>&gt;<i> Afghanistan as a way of organizing public outrage. Do not discount the
</I>&gt;<i> power of solidarity with disgruntled soldiers. We only have to recall
</I>&gt;<i> the Abril Revolution in 1974 in Portugal, where the military supported
</I>&gt;<i> the peaceful transition from the Salazar dictatorship, to understand
</I>&gt;<i> how important it is to have military forces on one's side. Recall as
</I>&gt;<i> well that the main technical tool used to anonymize submissions to
</I>&gt;<i> WikiLeaks, Tor (The Onion Router), came out of a US Naval Research
</I>&gt;<i> Laboratory project to protect clandestine activities overseas. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, members of the military are some of the most vocal opponents of
</I>&gt;<i> current attempts in the US to require person-level attribution of data
</I>&gt;<i> packets online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. WikiLeaks is a classic example of using media as a tool for
</I>&gt;<i> de-dehumanizing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The actions of Anonymous on the websites of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal,
</I>&gt;<i> PostFinance, and others are in a lineage with the FloodNet by the
</I>&gt;<i> Electronic Disturbance Theater. While many mainstream media sources
</I>&gt;<i> see these as &quot;attacks&quot;, others, such as the editors of The Guardian,
</I>&gt;<i> realize them to be &quot;non-violent action or civil disobedience&quot;. We do
</I>&gt;<i> not want to discount how easy it is for the media and authorities to
</I>&gt;<i> misconstrue these actions as illegal denial of service attacks, as a
</I>&gt;<i> 16-year old Dutch teenager is finding out right now, or as the EDT and
</I>&gt;<i> b.a.n.g. lab found out earlier this year. Nevertheless, we are seeing
</I>&gt;<i> a certain maturation of this technique as acceptable to others outside
</I>&gt;<i> of the net.art community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, the deliberation process of Anonymous prefigures future
</I>&gt;<i> forms of activist collaboration online, subject to the caveats
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above. Discussions happened across a diversity of networked
</I>&gt;<i> media, both old and new (IRC, Twitter, Blogspot, PiratePad, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> Orderly discussion under the control of a leader was not the norm, as
</I>&gt;<i> individuals simultaneously put forth their own suggestions to have
</I>&gt;<i> them edited into or out of existence. As Gabriella Coleman wrote
</I>&gt;<i> in her analysis of their planning, they appeared to be &quot;seasoned
</I>&gt;<i> political activists&quot;, not simply &quot;script-kiddies&quot; as they are
</I>&gt;<i> described by both the mainstream media and other hacker organizations
</I>&gt;<i> such as 2600. Maybe there is something those of us interested in new
</I>&gt;<i> forms of organization can learn from these predominantly 16-24-year
</I>&gt;<i> olds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Wikileaks suggests an understanding of a notion of networks as
</I>&gt;<i> media assemblages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the recent Wikileaks phenomenon
</I>&gt;<i> has to do with what it portends for future networked tendencies. Given
</I>&gt;<i> what we stated in anti-thesis 1, we ought to pay more attention to
</I>&gt;<i> the movement of information outside of Internet-based networks. There
</I>&gt;<i> is a tendency to conflate network sharing of data with the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> proper, but this is not a necessary condition. Indeed, there are
</I>&gt;<i> multitudinous methods of arranging networks of humans and things that
</I>&gt;<i> do not rely on corporate or government controlled conduits for the
</I>&gt;<i> passage of bits. Consider, for example, the host of artistic projects
</I>&gt;<i> in this space just from the past couple of years: netless, Feral
</I>&gt;<i> Trade, deadswap, Dead Drops, Fluid Nexus, Autonet, etc. These projects
</I>&gt;<i> rely on assemblages of humans and infrastructure in motion. And, they
</I>&gt;<i> rely in part on a prior agreement among participants with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> protocols to follow. This is already at work in the Wikileaks project
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to their main members. Only they know who they are; we
</I>&gt;<i> are in the dark, and rightly so. This is an application of Hakim Bey's
</I>&gt;<i> concept of Immediatism, updated to take into account a certain mongrel
</I>&gt;<i> of immediate contact and networked activities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the projects just mentioned foreground a certain notion
</I>&gt;<i> of slowness that works to counteract the notions of &quot;information
</I>&gt;<i> overload&quot;. If data transport relies on the motion of humans from
</I>&gt;<i> one location to another, this will require a particular patience,
</I>&gt;<i> producing a form of slowness. Nevertheless, this should not be
</I>&gt;<i> understood as a pastoral call as voiced by certain proponents of, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, the Slow Food Movement. Rather it is a way to reinvigorate
</I>&gt;<i> thought and practice regarding human-scale machinic assemblages. What
</I>&gt;<i> remains is the difficult and challenging work of producing long-term,
</I>&gt;<i> permanent ad-hoc networks.
