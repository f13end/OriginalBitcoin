<PRE>Hi Neal, you write:

&lt;In order for an innovation to move from early adopters to the early
majority, the language around the innovation has to change from &quot;true
believer&quot; language of those at the margin to &quot;what's in it for me&quot;
language of the masses.  The language of science is a possible source
of inspiration since they do not focus on the moral dimension but
rather focus on practices that actually work.  That's why I'm an
admirer of the Resilience Alliance and Ostrom's work.  This is not to
say that the moral dimension is unimportant, what I'm addressing here
is the need to use inclusive, benefits-driven language to create a
broad-based movement.&gt;


Do you really think the 'masses' are only moved by selfish interest, and are
not, like everyone else, moved by a contradictory mix of  selfish,
relational/reciprocal, and altruist/idealist motivations?

I know of few social movements that would have been successfull with an
appeal to pure self-interest,

advertising is a counter-example, but that does by promoting isolation and
envy,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was supposed to be funny.  Comedic FAIL.  I added this only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because I honestly couldn't think of a specific example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an important point - and it would be great to hear Michel, who
</I>&gt;<i> has been using this term throughout this exchange, to actually exemplify
</I>&gt;<i> it. Otherwise, one could easily be misled to suspect that it is a demon
</I>&gt;<i> in an imaginary closet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, you don't need virulent anti-capitalist rhetoric to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marginalize this movement or create divides.  You can use ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leftist phrases like social justice, which I heard aplenty at the ICC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Social justice&quot;, in Western thought, is a 2000+ year old greek
</I>&gt;<i> philosophical concept attributed to Aristotle, which runs through most
</I>&gt;<i> of liberal thought since and today. _Liberal_ here doesn't mean what it
</I>&gt;<i> does in common US parlance, where anything left of Kissinger is liberal,
</I>&gt;<i> but is used in the sense of the &quot;Political Philosophy of Liberalism&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Social justice also appeared in the thought of Confucius a few hundred
</I>&gt;<i> years earlier during the Spring and Autumn Period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To say that social justice is a leftist thing is entirely misleading and
</I>&gt;<i> quite simply false. Even a neoliberal philosopher would suggest that the
</I>&gt;<i> free market delivers social justice. Capitalism, according to its
</I>&gt;<i> proponents and advocates, is a system that is intended to deliver social
</I>&gt;<i> justice. In fact, I don't think there is much leftist-ism about it,
</I>&gt;<i> really, since leftist thought is extra-ordinarily preoccupied with
</I>&gt;<i> critiques of the liberal concept of justice, which is an abstract,
</I>&gt;<i> community-detached concept where all are equal before the law,
</I>&gt;<i> notwithstanding particular contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, you are quite right, you don't need anti-capitalist rhetoric to
</I>&gt;<i> divide or marginalise a movement - but you will probably need a sound
</I>&gt;<i> analysis of capital and power if you want to avoid the processes of
</I>&gt;<i> recuperation and enclosure that most other social change movements have
</I>&gt;<i> suffered in the past. Learning lessons from history can be a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The history of the labour movement - which in itself signals a defeat of
</I>&gt;<i> the commoning peasantry - is a prime example: managers and negotiators -
</I>&gt;<i> self-styled leaders and representative spokesmen - undermined the
</I>&gt;<i> interests of the working class while smoking cigars and drinking cognac
</I>&gt;<i> with capital interests. Very similar dynamics can be observed in almost
</I>&gt;<i> all social movements to varying degrees and the same thing goes for the
</I>&gt;<i> commons: influence seeking individuals water down the principle waves
</I>&gt;<i> upon which they surf and emerge as leaders of a new market expansion niche.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I love the intention behind such phrases, but also think that these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phrases are of varied effectiveness in moving new practices for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managing society into the mainstream.  They're loaded with moral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obligation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is moral obligation? That one or a community is obligated to show
</I>&gt;<i> consideration to others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The GPL is an articulation of social and moral obligations, for instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order for an innovation to move from early adopters to the early
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority, the language around the innovation has to change from &quot;true
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believer&quot; language of those at the margin to &quot;what's in it for me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language of the masses.  The language of science is a possible source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of inspiration since they do not focus on the moral dimension but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather focus on practices that actually work.  That's why I'm an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admirer of the Resilience Alliance and Ostrom's work.  This is not to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say that the moral dimension is unimportant, what I'm addressing here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the need to use inclusive, benefits-driven language to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; broad-based movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The language of &quot;what is in it for me&quot; - also known as self-interest -
</I>&gt;<i> is central to liberal thought (againt this is not US liberalism, but
</I>&gt;<i> political philosophy liberalism) and at the heart of the capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> ecnonomy --- and that is the very system of thought and frame of mind
</I>&gt;<i> that Stallman reacted to when he conceived of the GPL as a social
</I>&gt;<i> justice good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When Ostrom set out in the 1960s on her life's mission she also began in
</I>&gt;<i> reaction to the all-pervasive myth (or, rather, the by now
</I>&gt;<i> self-fulfilled prophecy) of self-interest. It is at best an incomplete,
</I>&gt;<i> short term strategy to base a movement on self-interest, unless, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, that is the kind of positive feedback loop that you do want to
</I>&gt;<i> establish and institute. That is precisely what capitalist democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> based on and perpetuates: exclusive, self-interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Commons, on the other hand, are not based on (a narrow conception of)
</I>&gt;<i> self-interest and both the challenge and the promise of commons as a
</I>&gt;<i> concept of social organisation, as far as I am concerned, is precisely
</I>&gt;<i> that it is not based on self-interest, but on notions of sociality and
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me to be rather bizarre to want to move commons into
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream society by disregarding the manner in which commons differ
</I>&gt;<i> from what philosophically, legally and economically underpins mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> society, and replacing that underpinning with the very same idea that
</I>&gt;<i> underpins the mainstream society which is sought changed. Very
</I>&gt;<i> backwards/awkwards approach to social change.
</I>&gt;<i>
