<PRE>Hey Martin,
 
 Mathieu here, I'm the editor of a new journal project, critical studies  in peer production (<A HREF="http://cspp.oekonux.org/">http://cspp.oekonux.org/</A>), we have been fine-tuning  layout etc for a while, getting ready to launch soon. I really like the  points you make below, if you would like to convert them into a short  article we could include it into our &quot;debate&quot; section with possibly a  response from Michel or whoever feels strongly about the issue?
 
 All best,
 
 Mathieu

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Michel,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are right to warn about &quot;being stuck in critique&quot; - or in 
</I>&gt;<i> any other
</I>&gt;<i> rhetoric, whether self-styled or based on established ideology - 
</I>&gt;<i> and I
</I>&gt;<i> shall be the first to lament conventional, unreflective leftist 
</I>&gt;<i> positions.
</I>&gt;<i> As the subject line indicates, virtual commons are within free culture
</I>&gt;<i> commonly, in general, considered in isolation from the 
</I>&gt;<i> materiality that
</I>&gt;<i> makes them possible and which constitutes one of the fastest growing
</I>&gt;<i> environmental threats. This is not an ideological point, but a 
</I>&gt;<i> technicalpoint, and it continues to be a hidden aspect of free 
</I>&gt;<i> culture and
</I>&gt;<i> virtual commons, and will remain hidden until the philosophy and
</I>&gt;<i> language from within the movements recognise the material 
</I>&gt;<i> dependency and
</I>&gt;<i> enormous energy consumption that digital commons entail. That 
</I>&gt;<i> was and is
</I>&gt;<i> all I am saying: do not be in denial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, on a personal note, I proceed from the principle that one
</I>&gt;<i> should not bother criticising something that one does not care for:
</I>&gt;<i> critique is an attempt to improve: preguntando caminamos - and the
</I>&gt;<i> questioning as we walk is of course also of our own footsteps and
</I>&gt;<i> direction (in fact, when building alternatives there is not much 
</I>&gt;<i> else to
</I>&gt;<i> question). Else, it would risk ending up like in some western 
</I>&gt;<i> New Age
</I>&gt;<i> community where everyone is smiling with joy, although they are 
</I>&gt;<i> furiouson the inside, with themselves and with each other - for 
</I>&gt;<i> the more
</I>&gt;<i> enlightened, the more happy, and so to admit to *not* be happy 
</I>&gt;<i> and *not*
</I>&gt;<i> on the verge of nirvana would signal a failure. So we smile. In short:
</I>&gt;<i> denial, repression and the danger of explosion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what you mean with those who &quot;just don't get 
</I>&gt;<i> it&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> for my part I am quite sure that most people understand very 
</I>&gt;<i> easily that
</I>&gt;<i> energy and hardware don't just drop from the sky, but have to be
</I>&gt;<i> generated and produced and that this production is 
</I>&gt;<i> environmentally and
</I>&gt;<i> humanly costly, *if* they are made aware of that - but you seem to
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that *I* just don't get &quot;it&quot; - &quot;it&quot; being your world 
</I>&gt;<i> view. Well,
</I>&gt;<i> what is it that I don't get?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have answered in more detail below - hoping that this can become
</I>&gt;<i> either a constructive exchange, or that we can just leave it 
</I>&gt;<i> here - with
</I>&gt;<i> a view to clearing up some of the misunderstandings that were 
</I>&gt;<i> reflectedin your responses (to what I was trying to say).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you say &quot;berlin&quot; was allergic to stances directly confronting 
</I>&gt;<i> capital, can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you give some concrete examples?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I said we heard it time and again during the conference and in
</I>&gt;<i> meetings - even in pejorative terms with gestures and with overbearing
</I>&gt;<i> shrugs. I was actually rather shocked, not so much by the 
</I>&gt;<i> arrogance and
</I>&gt;<i> superiority of it, as the assumption that such denigrating statements
</I>&gt;<i> were OK to make and reflected a common(s) sense. This is no 
</I>&gt;<i> place for
</I>&gt;<i> specifics, as they are personal, - if you managed to _not_ 
</I>&gt;<i> notice I am
</I>&gt;<i> rather surprised - but in some sense it doesn't matter, while in 
</I>&gt;<i> othersit matters a lot:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The movements of peasants, landless and indigenous - as well as urban
</I>&gt;<i> radical movements - I imagine, outnumber the digital commoners; and
</I>&gt;<i> without land and its resources there can be no cyberspace. After all,
</I>&gt;<i> half the population is still rural and many urban dwellers rely upon
</I>&gt;<i> their villages to feed them in the city, as anyone who has ever been
</I>&gt;<i> doing development work on the frontiers of capitalism will know 
</I>&gt;<i> all too
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the expansion of cyberspace threatens the commoners of the land,
</I>&gt;<i> there needs to be some sort of mutual recognition of the this
</I>&gt;<i> inter-dependence. Every time the digital commons discourse 
</I>&gt;<i> ignores and
</I>&gt;<i> denies this material foundation, the problem is consolidated. If 
</I>&gt;<i> you see
</I>&gt;<i> yourself as a public intellectual, then you must realise - as Lessig,
</I>&gt;<i> Benkler et al. before you - that you to quite some extent have 
</I>&gt;<i> to take
</I>&gt;<i> on the responsibility as a central contributor to defining (refining?)
</I>&gt;<i> the discourse of those who follow. At this stage, the digital commons
</I>&gt;<i> discourse is saturated with politics that build on the misleading
</I>&gt;<i> (deliberately misleading! (I will document this on demand)) discourse
</I>&gt;<i> established by the Ivy League leaders who have defined the territory
</I>&gt;<i> intellectually - and done so in such a manner as to not only pose
</I>&gt;<i> minimal threat to capital interests, but indeed to be helpful 
</I>&gt;<i> for their
</I>&gt;<i> expansion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The movements for the defense of commons first had their de 
</I>&gt;<i> facto rights
</I>&gt;<i> articulated in the Charter of Forests (ca. 1215-1225), and apart from
</I>&gt;<i> various great uprisings - the last, in this part of the world, during
</I>&gt;<i> the Spanish Revolution in the 1930s - it has been a slow, but safe
</I>&gt;<i> decay: from having collective right of access to land for food, 
</I>&gt;<i> fuel and
</I>&gt;<i> building materials to abstract, individual rights that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> suspendedin a state of emergency, which have become permanent 
</I>&gt;<i> features in the
</I>&gt;<i> contemporary world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one thing worries me though, you say that we should wait &quot;that 
</I>&gt;<i> we are all on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same page&quot;, but surely, that cannot be a reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> inaction, until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; magical moment when that would happen? this stance, waiting 
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;once we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all on the same page .. then let us move forward&quot;, is a 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; staying in the critical stage, with no movement towards 
</I>&gt;<i> concretely building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the alternatives ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure why you choose to (mis)understand what I said in 
</I>&gt;<i> this way,
</I>&gt;<i> but to clarify: You asked me for *specific* answers and I said 
</I>&gt;<i> that I do
</I>&gt;<i> not have any real answers at this stage. Why not? Because I 
</I>&gt;<i> consider the
</I>&gt;<i> development of answers, solutions and action plans as 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily a
</I>&gt;<i> collective effort that has to come from within the movement(s) - 
</I>&gt;<i> we find
</I>&gt;<i> the answers as we walk on, asking each other, reflecting  
</I>&gt;<i> critically,avoiding gooey eyed denial - like moths staring into 
</I>&gt;<i> the virtual light.
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage, my contribution is merely a philosophical 
</I>&gt;<i> questioning of
</I>&gt;<i> the politics of free culture.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to the way in which digital commons are embedded in
</I>&gt;<i> natural resource systems and what can be done about it, I said 
</I>&gt;<i> that an
</I>&gt;<i> important first step is towards *acknowledging* that problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> This means
</I>&gt;<i> in very simple terms that if you have not acknowledged and 
</I>&gt;<i> recognised a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, it is going to be difficult to solve it. Everytime the 
</I>&gt;<i> politicsand development of the digital commons rest on the false 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions of
</I>&gt;<i> immateriality, the materiality is obscured further.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have the answers - and I don't think that anyone has The 
</I>&gt;<i> Answers- but if any set of solutions are to be developed from 
</I>&gt;<i> within the
</I>&gt;<i> digital commons movement with respect to the problematic 
</I>&gt;<i> embedding in
</I>&gt;<i> and exploitation of natural resources (as carried out by mining and
</I>&gt;<i> nuclear etc etc.), then that embedding must be faced up to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;On the same page&quot;, then, refers to a collective recognition of the
</I>&gt;<i> problem, which should be seen as a prerequisite to collective 
</I>&gt;<i> solving of
</I>&gt;<i> the problem. You project ideology and negativity into that 
</I>&gt;<i> proposition -
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know why - and claim it is critique that is not 
</I>&gt;<i> constructive. I
</I>&gt;<i> think denial is much less constructive than trying to come to 
</I>&gt;<i> terms with
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, without claiming this is an answer, I do regularly visit
</I>&gt;<i> communities where surfing is limited to a few hours a day, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless there
</I>&gt;<i> is a particularly strong wind or a lot of sunshine, because they 
</I>&gt;<i> are off
</I>&gt;<i> the grid. As such, one of the questions that one could ask, as 
</I>&gt;<i> we walk
</I>&gt;<i> and chew gum and whatever else you like to do, is where are our 
</I>&gt;<i> projectshosted? What could we do to create (non-General Electric 
</I>&gt;<i> patent-based,
</I>&gt;<i> non-industrial scale) wind powered, communally owned hosting on 
</I>&gt;<i> recycledhardware for digital commons?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in any case, the pages of the p2p foundation blog are open to 
</I>&gt;<i> any news and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments about the land issue, non-eurocentric visions of 
</I>&gt;<i> history, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; material basis of the digital commons,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is good, and so is this list, and that is why I 
</I>&gt;<i> brought up the
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the key for me is to go beyond the stage and stance of 
</I>&gt;<i> critique, that others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;just don't get it&quot;, towards actually injecting such 
</I>&gt;<i> perspectives in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concrete discourse, and associated with constructive action,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know where you get this from, but if it came from 
</I>&gt;<i> anything I
</I>&gt;<i> said, let me clarify: I never said that anyone &quot;didn't get it&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> I said
</I>&gt;<i> that as a culture - a cultural norm - the material embedding is not
</I>&gt;<i> recognised and in a variety of ways even obscured through 
</I>&gt;<i> philosophicalideas and concepts of social organisation that - as 
</I>&gt;<i> the subject line
</I>&gt;<i> still reads, and which is how this exchange came about - &quot;Non digital
</I>&gt;<i> commons a lot more complicated than Free Software&quot;. This is only true
</I>&gt;<i> insofar as you see Free Software and other digital commons as 
</I>&gt;<i> having no
</I>&gt;<i> material base. In fact, they are infinitely more complicated, 
</I>&gt;<i> since they
</I>&gt;<i> are a techno-virtual layer on top of ecosystems - or, as it were,
</I>&gt;<i> digital commons require a material, technostructural 
</I>&gt;<i> underpinning. In
</I>&gt;<i> other words, digital commons need to address their hardware and energy
</I>&gt;<i> use, as part of their organisational processes and they should have
</I>&gt;<i> support in doing so. This is not about rejecting digital commons that
</I>&gt;<i> are impure, but rather about a conscious move away from &quot;impurity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Purity we can leave to the religions, but that does not mean we should
</I>&gt;<i> deny certain problematic &quot;impurities.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find it hard to imagine that the labour movement would have gotten
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere without using print media to the full extent, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is what they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not only did, but was actually there central focus;  
</I>&gt;<i> creating print vehicle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for agitprop was actually the core activity of the 
</I>&gt;<i> revolutionary movements
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many readings of the labour movements - some of which argue
</I>&gt;<i> very well that social-democracy and later the welfare system 
</I>&gt;<i> spelled the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of the end of the working class movements, 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to local control over local infrastructure. Indeed, the very
</I>&gt;<i> notion of a &quot;working class&quot; expresses a defeat of commoners of 
</I>&gt;<i> the land
</I>&gt;<i> and, as noted by Colin Ward, the welfare system, after the 
</I>&gt;<i> crises of the
</I>&gt;<i> 1930s and in order to rebuild after the war, in many communities in
</I>&gt;<i> England shifted power from local communities to central 
</I>&gt;<i> government over
</I>&gt;<i> schools, libraries and so on. If print had helped the labour 
</I>&gt;<i> movements,the centralised curriculum has long since subverted 
</I>&gt;<i> that advantage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree with what seems to be your take on history and I think
</I>&gt;<i> that the writing of the history of the commoners rendered working
</I>&gt;<i> classes has only just begun - there is a lot to discuss and I am very
</I>&gt;<i> wary of anyone claiming to see a full picture of those particular
</I>&gt;<i> histories with specific reference to the transformation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> field of
</I>&gt;<i> forces within which they operate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very good place to start, by the way:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Peter Linebaugh, The London Hanged, London: Allen Lane, 1991, Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> 11: &quot;Ships and Chips: Technological Repression and the Origin of 
</I>&gt;<i> the Wage.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One could also consult the more philosophical:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Social Democracy thought fit to to assign to the working class 
</I>&gt;<i> the role
</I>&gt;<i> of the redeemer of future generations, in this way cutting the 
</I>&gt;<i> sinews of
</I>&gt;<i> its greatest strength. This training made the working class 
</I>&gt;<i> forget both
</I>&gt;<i> its hatred and its spirit of sacrifice, for both are nourished 
</I>&gt;<i> by the
</I>&gt;<i> image of enslaved ancestors rather than that of liberated 
</I>&gt;<i> grandchildren&#8221;(Walter Benjamin 1940/1982: 262).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or the radically political (in the words of a critical liberal):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The representative of the working classes, Sorel observed, 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes an
</I>&gt;<i> excellent bourgeois very easily. The hideous examples are before our
</I>&gt;<i> eyes &#8211; Millerand, Briand, Viviani, the spellbinding demagogue Jean
</I>&gt;<i> Jaur&#232;s with his easily acquired popularity. Sorel had once hoped for
</I>&gt;<i> much from these men, but was disillusioned. They all turned out 
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> squalid earthworms, rhetoricians, grafters and intriguers like 
</I>&gt;<i> the rest&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> (Isaiah Berlin 1955/1979: 313)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, there is certainly substantial disagreements about 
</I>&gt;<i> whetherthe working class has been successful, or whether it has 
</I>&gt;<i> been swallowed
</I>&gt;<i> up in a tide of non-principled stances of influence-seekers and
</I>&gt;<i> moderates, who smiled and said to just follow them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, your statement about print technology and labour movements 
</I>&gt;<i> - apart
</I>&gt;<i> from relying upon a quetionable history reading - is deeply 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic(or somewhat empty rhetoric). Compare with this statement:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;When the rains came, the small ponds of the poor people were filled.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is true, but it also rained in the park of the rich 
</I>&gt;<i> and their
</I>&gt;<i> ponds were much bigger, so they were, in absolute terms, filled 
</I>&gt;<i> even more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In that sense, you are mobilising the labour movements in a highly
</I>&gt;<i> questionable manner in defence and justification of your own position.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Technology changed *every*thing, the entire context for all parties
</I>&gt;<i> involved in any struggle, but it likely empowered the already 
</I>&gt;<i> empoweredmore than the less empowered......
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a silly simplification:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the power of the working class was 1.2 power points before 
</I>&gt;<i> print, and
</I>&gt;<i> if print added 2 times power, then they ended at 2.4 power 
</I>&gt;<i> points. If
</I>&gt;<i> the power of the rich was 3.1 before print, and if print added 2 times
</I>&gt;<i> power, then they ended at 6.2 power points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who gained most? Who gained most from the last twenty years of ICT
</I>&gt;<i> revolution? Wal-Mart, as they pioneered just-in-time and became the
</I>&gt;<i> fastest growing corporation in history since Ford (probably now 
</I>&gt;<i> dwarfedby that commons enclosure operation called Facebook?). To 
</I>&gt;<i> realise the
</I>&gt;<i> potential power and emancipation for the oppressed that ICT might
</I>&gt;<i> deliver requires careful consideration, not mere promises based 
</I>&gt;<i> on a
</I>&gt;<i> dubious historical reading.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, while I think that technological determinism can be a useful
</I>&gt;<i> tool to ponder history and development, I would much rather, as a
</I>&gt;<i> precautionary principle, go with the exact opposite of you....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ....Here with reference to the work of James C. Scott, 
</I>&gt;<i> surprisingly an
</I>&gt;<i> Ivy League professor, but he is also towards retirement age, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is
</I>&gt;<i> usually when you hear them say something of radical (or even 
</I>&gt;<i> subversive)interest:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In his most speculative and contested claim, Scott argues that 
</I>&gt;<i> even the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of a written language in many Zomian societies is an adaptive
</I>&gt;<i> measure and a conscious societal choice. For peasants, writing was,
</I>&gt;<i> first and foremost, a tool of state control - it was the 
</I>&gt;<i> instrument the
</I>&gt;<i> elite used to extract money, labor, and military service from 
</I>&gt;<i> them. As a
</I>&gt;<i> result, Scott argues, when those peasants escaped into the hills they
</I>&gt;<i> discarded writing in an attempt to ensure that similar coercive
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies didn&#8217;t arise in the new societies they formed.

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I&#8217;ve studied peasant rebellions, and one of first things that early
</I>&gt;<i> peasant rebellions always do is to attack the records office,&#8221; says

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The 20th century, with its arsenal of distance-devouring technologies
</I>&gt;<i> from the airplane to the Internet, has made it easier for states to
</I>&gt;<i> smooth the friction of landscape, and recent decades have also 
</I>&gt;<i> seen a
</I>&gt;<i> determined campaign among Asian states to bring their highland regions
</I>&gt;<i> into the fold, often by settling them with lowland people more 
</I>&gt;<i> loyal to
</I>&gt;<i> the national government. As a result, since World War II, Zomia 
</I>&gt;<i> has lost
</I>&gt;<i> much of its distinctive wildness.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From that perspective, your position is somewhat old school marxist,
</I>&gt;<i> insofar as I know and understand any of all that: we just have 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep
</I>&gt;<i> on pushing through capitalism and we will get to the promised 
</I>&gt;<i> land in
</I>&gt;<i> the end. It doesn't resonate with me. I would much rather ask 
</I>&gt;<i> criticallywhile we walk and use lessons from history written not 
</I>&gt;<i> by winners.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see more and more clearly that certain individuals and 
</I>&gt;<i> social  forces,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of focusing their critical gaze on the system of 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite growth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is destroying the biosphere, are focusing their critical 
</I>&gt;<i> gaze on those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who are actually closer to them; and seeking division instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commonality; complaining about the imperfections and relative 
</I>&gt;<i> blindness of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the free culture movement; rather than to see alignment 
</I>&gt;<i> between social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forces that would have the greatest potential uniting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this based on something I said? You have managed to turn the
</I>&gt;<i> whole thing around?!?! The current growth paradigm thrives on 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;renewabletechnology&quot; (wind turbines, hybrid cars), and digital 
</I>&gt;<i> commons  - these
</I>&gt;<i> are central to the growth vision. The expansion of digital 
</I>&gt;<i> commons is
</I>&gt;<i> destroying the biosphere. The critical gaze that focuses on the
</I>&gt;<i> materiality of cyberspace and thus the ecological problems of the
</I>&gt;<i> digital commons is precisely addressing the problem of infinite growth
</I>&gt;<i> in a non-simplistic manner - trying to negotiate an ambiguous problem:
</I>&gt;<i> how can we have digital networks without destroying the environment?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To compare say the digital commons of appropedia, and its 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts to create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sustainable and appropriate technology for local communities 
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the multinational owners of a supermarket chain, is in my 
</I>&gt;<i> eyes, a perverse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equation, and shows that a certain sense of priorities has 
</I>&gt;<i> been lost, (&quot;Digital
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commons are parasites on natural resources and territories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of people elsewhere in the world in much the same way as 
</I>&gt;<i> supermarkets are.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not very helpful to shift from the general to the 
</I>&gt;<i> particular in
</I>&gt;<i> the middle of a conceptual discussion. I spoke of digital 
</I>&gt;<i> commons in
</I>&gt;<i> general - and pointed to a factual general problem - and you respond
</I>&gt;<i> with a specific example..... perhaps an exemption to prove the rule?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For what it is worth: It is not perverse, but a simple fact: the 
</I>&gt;<i> energyuse of a supermarket - from electricity use in the store 
</I>&gt;<i> to the fossil
</I>&gt;<i> fuel fertilisers used in the production of the commodities for 
</I>&gt;<i> sale - is
</I>&gt;<i> very comparable to the energy and resource use that digital commons
</I>&gt;<i> entail, if you see it from the perspective of the oppressed, 
</I>&gt;<i> landless or
</I>&gt;<i> through the eyes of the children disassembling hardware when it is
</I>&gt;<i> recycled. The supermarket helps some of the poor, some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> time - for
</I>&gt;<i> instance a single mother or the career, short-of-time feminist 
</I>&gt;<i> on her
</I>&gt;<i> way to a meeting about resisting the cuts - indeed, supermarkets can
</I>&gt;<i> help many people, including those who work for it, who would otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> be unemployed, but it comes with a tremendous cost for others, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hidden&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The shareholders of Carrefour and Wal-Mart cheer on 
</I>&gt;<i> supermarkets, just
</I>&gt;<i> as the shareholders of IBM and Google cheer on Open Source, Open 
</I>&gt;<i> Accessand other areas of economic growth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the truth is, every living being and system is 
</I>&gt;<i> (inter)dependent on others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and in that sense, a parasite ... what matters is to create 
</I>&gt;<i> sustainable&gt; flows between the various living systems, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intelligence between autonomous individuals and communities, 
</I>&gt;<i> in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; achieve that, for which digital commons are not parasites, but 
</I>&gt;<i> essential&gt; enablers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But they are also exploitors - through mining, heavy metal pollution,
</I>&gt;<i> sweatshop labour and so on - and this is not an ideological 
</I>&gt;<i> point, but
</I>&gt;<i> a simple fact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, all that said, I agree, let us break some eggs to make the
</I>&gt;<i> omelette. I never wanted to argue that the internet should be 
</I>&gt;<i> torn down
</I>&gt;<i> - what would I be doing here? - but it should be used 
</I>&gt;<i> consciously and in
</I>&gt;<i> recognition and full admittance of its costs. There is no such 
</I>&gt;<i> thing as
</I>&gt;<i> marginal reproduction cost, except in Wonderland, perhaps, where
</I>&gt;<i> perpetual motion machines are possible and where gravity can be defied
</I>&gt;<i> by will alone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The immateriality argument about the relation between cost and
</I>&gt;<i> reproduction of digital goods, is really comparable to, say, the
</I>&gt;<i> relation between light in your house, on the one hand, and electricity
</I>&gt;<i> and the continued upkeep of the electrical infrastructure 
</I>&gt;<i> (nuclear power
</I>&gt;<i> plants, cables, wires, pylons, switches and so on) on the other: It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't *seem to* cost anything when I flick the switch and the light
</I>&gt;<i> comes on in &quot;my&quot; house, so why isn't it just free? Would anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> take me
</I>&gt;<i> serious if I said that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as hard as it may be to do and understand, we need to chew gum 
</I>&gt;<i> and walk at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same time, using digital commons to organize, while 
</I>&gt;<i> working at the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time to lighten the physical footprint of digital commons, and 
</I>&gt;<i> using global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open design communities to build open and 'light' 
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures to achieve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sustainability,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and I never said anything different - but how do you 
</I>&gt;<i> propose to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lighten the footprint&quot;, as collective action, when the 
</I>&gt;<i> collective is in
</I>&gt;<i> denial about that footprint and when its leaders and 
</I>&gt;<i> consequently the
</I>&gt;<i> followers perpetuate the denial?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the best of wishes,
