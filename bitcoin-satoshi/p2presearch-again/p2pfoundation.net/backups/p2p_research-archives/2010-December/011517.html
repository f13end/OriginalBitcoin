<PRE>Dear P2P Research List,

Between now and 2012, I'd like to start sending challenges to the
various progressive political groups here in the industrial midwest to
think about embracing what *we* are collectively talking about as a
perspective that can actually make a difference now.

I'd like to appeal to you all to help me think about how to construct
these messages, and how to respond to interest. Let's call this an
experiment, and I'll be happy if the results are nothing more than
creating a new awareness of the emerging P2P paradigm among the
industrial midwest progressive left.

The following is an example of the types of messages that I receive at
least weekly, if not more. These people are active in the fundraising
efforts for the Democratic party. What I would like to eventually  do
is get these people sending out these email blasts talking *about us*
in their emails. That is: talking about the stuff that we are talking
about in P2P <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Open">http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Open</A>

It's my opinion that *this* is the real agenda for 21st century
progressive politics in the industrial midwest, USA, and it's time to
get it on their radar for real.

Dear Sam,

Last night, I watched the film 2012, a disaster-action flick that
depicts the destruction of Earth and the fight to survive and rebuild.

Does that sound a little familiar?

It's no secret that a slow-to-recover economy ushered in a staggering
defeat for progressives in November. And while it may have felt, for a
moment, like the end of the world as we knew it, the truth is that
it's our job to face this challenge with renewed determination and
resolve.

2012 is our next chance to show Michiganders how progressive ideas and
policies are remaking our state for the better. But we aren't going to
wait until then &#8211; we're going to start now, and we need your help.

Can you give $25, $50, or even $200 to get us going?

Everything we've accomplished as a progressive community these past
eight years is likely to come under attack, from ground-breaking stem
cell research to moving Michigan beyond coal and into a clean energy
future. The state Legislature is more anti-choice than ever, and we no
longer have the recourse of a veto on extreme policies in the
Governor's mansion.

There's so much at stake: more than 109,000 Michiganders make their
living in the clean energy sector, and others make ends meet
conducting the research that might one day cure Parkinson's. Every
progressive policy that's rolled back by the incoming conservative
government will cost us jobs, stall our economic recovery and make
Michigan a relic, not a leader.

We're not going to buckle in the face of the most conservative
government Michigan's ever known. We're going to fight even harder to
protect Michigan's clean energy jobs, world-class research centers,
women's right to choose, and our Great Lakes from right-wing policies.

We're not waiting for 2012. We're starting now.

We need your help to do it. Please give what you can today to make
sure we can start now!

Thanks for all you do,

Angela Vasquez-Giroux and the entire Progress Michigan team
