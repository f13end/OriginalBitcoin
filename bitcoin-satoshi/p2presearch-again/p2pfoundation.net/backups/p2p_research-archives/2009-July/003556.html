<PRE>Robert,

I could not find a source connected to your quote and claim that 'most
economists still cling to the &#8220;infinite wants&#8221; idea.'  If that was the case,
I would expect to have run into it by now, and I would also expect abundant
examples of that assumption.  Does any serious economic literature from the
last, say, 30 years mention the concept as foundational?

Lack of evidence aside, I don't think refutation of infinite human wants
changes anything.  No infinite variables are required to cause a problem
with the allocation of finite resources.  In other words, we need to only
want to do something that will kill us in a few years (completely regardless
of whether we can foresee it or not), and have the means. From an economic
viewpoint, the concern is external costs in our transactions. Infinite-ness
never enters into the concern.  In other words, infinite-ness was never the
problem of &quot;doom by externalities,&quot; and revealing finite bounds doesn't
eliminate the problem, either.

My current perspective: the reduction in information asymmetry resulting
from an information commons presents the best chance humanity has of
reducing negative externalities in transactions.

</I>&gt;<i>  A very *important contribution to abundance theory&lt;<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Abundance_vs._Scarcity">http://p2pfoundation.net/Abundance_vs._Scarcity</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * by Roberto Verzola&lt;<A HREF="http://rverzola.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/finite-demand-makes-relative-abundance-possible/">http://rverzola.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/finite-demand-makes-relative-abundance-possible/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&#8220;It is almost by definition that economists predominantly focus on
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity, when they define economics as the study of &#8220;the most efficient
</I>&gt;<i> ways to allocate scarce resources to meet infinite human wants&#8221;. If, indeed,
</I>&gt;<i> people had infinite wants, then not even all the resources of this finite
</I>&gt;<i> world will be enough for a single person.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *But I contend that consumer demand is not infinite. There exist physical,
</I>&gt;<i> physiological, psychological and cultural limits - both actual and potential
</I>&gt;<i> - to consumption which can keep individual as well as collective needs and
</I>&gt;<i> wants within finite bounds.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *If demand is finite, then satisfying this demand becomes a real
</I>&gt;<i> possibility, and relative abundance is within reach.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The following three concepts will help show that demand can remain within
</I>&gt;<i> finite bounds:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Satiation. Economists define satiation as the consumption level which the
</I>&gt;<i> consumer most prefers. *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The closer he is to this level, writes economist Hal Varian, &#8220;the better
</I>&gt;<i> off he is in terms of his own preferences&#8221;.This satiation level is also
</I>&gt;<i> called bliss point. Beyond it, the consumer becomes indifferent towards
</I>&gt;<i> getting more of the same good or may even prefer to have less of the good.
</I>&gt;<i> While many economists still cling to the hedonist principle that &#8220;more is
</I>&gt;<i> always preferred to less,&#8221; some acknowledge, at least in theory, that a
</I>&gt;<i> satiation level exists for some, if not most, goods. Varian, in particular,
</I>&gt;<i> says that most goods have a satiation point and that &#8220;you can have too much
</I>&gt;<i> of nearly anything,&#8221; which contradicts the &#8220;infinite wants&#8221; assertion in
</I>&gt;<i> most definitions of economics.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Saturation. While satiation may apply more to the psychological attitude
</I>&gt;<i> of a consumer not wanting more, saturation is more about the physiological
</I>&gt;<i> or physical incapacity of a person to consume more. *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Beyond the saturation point, one&#8217;s body will either become incapable or
</I>&gt;<i> involuntarily reject additional servings of food and drinks. One can only
</I>&gt;<i> wear so many clothes, or shoes. One can listen to only so many CDs or watch
</I>&gt;<i> only so many videos. There are only twenty-four hours a day after all.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *To reach the brain, a sense stimulus takes around 10-20 milliseconds. To
</I>&gt;<i> respond in a conscious way, neuro-scientists have found out, the brain takes
</I>&gt;<i> longer - around 500 milliseconds (half a second).2 This suggests that our
</I>&gt;<i> brain can only enjoy at most two distinct events every second or about
</I>&gt;<i> 170,000 every twenty-four hours. For a world with some six billion people,
</I>&gt;<i> that adds up to maximum of one quad (i.e., quadrillion) consumption events
</I>&gt;<i> per day. That is a huge number, it is true, but finite nevertheless. Most of
</I>&gt;<i> us will probably be too saturated long before that point.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *However, the concept of saturation as distinct from satiation is missing
</I>&gt;<i> in consumer theory and most economists still cling to the &#8220;infinite wants&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> idea.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Satisficing. Even before we reach our satiation or saturation levels, we
</I>&gt;<i> may already reach our &#8220;satisficed&#8221; level, in which the quantity we have of a
</I>&gt;<i> particular good or bundle of goods already suffices to satisfy, and beyond
</I>&gt;<i> which we would only weakly prefer more.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The idea that consumers satisfice rather than optimize when fitting their
</I>&gt;<i> wants to their budget was first raised by psychologist Herbert Simon, who
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently won the Economics Nobel Prize in 1978.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Any of these &#8220;sat&#8221; concepts - certainly all of them, together - are
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient to argue that individual and likewise aggregate demand have
</I>&gt;<i> finite bounds.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This justifies the following assertion: some consumers have a satisficing
</I>&gt;<i> level for some goods. We will leave to future research the debate whether
</I>&gt;<i> the weak assertion of &#8220;some consumers&#8221; and &#8220;some goods&#8221; can, in some
</I>&gt;<i> contexts or periods, be changed to a stronger assertion of &#8220;some consumers
</I>&gt;<i> for all goods&#8221;, &#8220;all consumers for some goods&#8221;, or even &#8220;all consumers for
</I>&gt;<i> all goods&#8221;.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The above assertion leads directly to a formal definition of abundance: when
</I>&gt;<i> a person can afford enough quantity of a good to reach his/her satisficed
</I>&gt;<i> level, then the person enjoys a state of abundance for that good. *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The concept is not new. Gandhi must have been referring to abundance when
</I>&gt;<i> he said, &#8220;the Earth has enough for everyone&#8217;s need&#8221;. This definition also
</I>&gt;<i> allows a good&#8217;s state of abundance with respect to one person to be
</I>&gt;<i> quantified. For instance, if a person&#8217;s satisficing level is five pairs of
</I>&gt;<i> shoes, but s/he can only afford two pairs, then s/he enjoys a state of
</I>&gt;<i> abundance of 40% (two out of five) with respect to shoes. This makes it
</I>&gt;<i> simple to relate abundance to its inverse, scarcity: the person needs three
</I>&gt;<i> pairs more to reach the five-pair satisficed level. Thus s/he faces a
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity level of 60%.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Economics usually assumes that business firms maximize their profits by
</I>&gt;<i> producing until their marginal cost (the cost of the next additional unit)
</I>&gt;<i> equals their marginal revenue (unit price of the good). If, in addition to
</I>&gt;<i> this behavioral assumption, we also assume diminishing returns or decreasing
</I>&gt;<i> returns to scale, this will eventually result in increasing marginal costs.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus business firms will, in theory, reach their satiation level when they
</I>&gt;<i> reach their maximum profits.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This also means, however, that profitable firms employing technologies
</I>&gt;<i> with constant or increasing returns to scale will face constant or
</I>&gt;<i> decreasing marginal costs. They will therefore have no profit maximum and
</I>&gt;<i> likewise no satiation level. These firms will conform to the theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> hedonist image for whom &#8220;more is always preferred to less&#8221;, and whose desire
</I>&gt;<i> to purchase is limited only by their budget and nothing more. They will also
</I>&gt;<i> try to keep increasing their scale of operations, as they go after higher
</I>&gt;<i> and higher profits - making them an engine of globalization. Here is a
</I>&gt;<i> possible answer, by the way, to what some economists consider a mystery,
</I>&gt;<i> that &#8220;neoclassical theory has no full explanation of why firms grow at all,
</I>&gt;<i> nor why it is that the typical pattern of the growth rates of firms seems to
</I>&gt;<i> lead inexorably towards persistently increasing aggregate business
</I>&gt;<i> concentration.&#8221;*
