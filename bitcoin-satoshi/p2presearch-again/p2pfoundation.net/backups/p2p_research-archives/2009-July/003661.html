<PRE>*WikiWars
   Call for Participation; 12th, 13th January, 2010, Bangalore
Event One for the Critical Point of View Reader*

*CPOV (CRITICAL POINT OF VIEW) CONTEXT: *The Wikipedia has emerged as the de
facto global reference of dynamic knowledge. Different stakeholders
Wikipedians, users, academics, researchers, gurus of Web 2.0, publishing
houses and governments have entered into fierce debates and discussions
about what the rise of Wikipedia and Wiki cultures means and how they
influence the information societies we live in. The Wikipedia itself has
been at the centre of much controversy, pivoted around questions of
accuracy, anonymity, vandalism, expertise and authority.

The Centre for Internet and Society (Bangalore, India) and the Institute of
Network Cultures (Amsterdam, Netherlands) are working together to produce a
critical Reader on Wikipedia and to build a Wikipedia Knowledge Network.
Under the rubric CPOV, we propose two events that bring together different
perspectives, approaches, experiences and stories that critically explore
different questions and concerns around Wikipedia. The proceeds from these
two events will result in a Reader that consolidates critical points of view
about Wikipedia.

*WIKIWARS CONFERENCE:* The first conference to be held in Bangalore, called
WikiWars, invites participation from users, scholars, academics,
practitioners, artists and other cultural workers, to share their
experiences, ideas, experiments, innovations, applications and stories about
Wikipedia. The WikiWars conference embodies the spirit that guides an open
encyclopaedia like the Wikipedia, by referring to the edit battles that
users enter into over topics that have many points of view. WikiWars also
refers to the contradictory positions adopted by different stakeholders on
the various issues of credibility, authority, verifiability and
truth-telling, on the Wikipedia. This conference calls for diverse and
varied knowledges to come together in a critical dialogic space that informs
and augments our understanding of the Wikipedia.

*CONFERENCE THEMES:* The possible themes and areas for presentations
(projects, experiences, experiments, stories or documentation) can include
but are not limited to:

  - Wiki Theory: Endorse, question/contest or delineate the theoretical
  approaches and view points on the Wikipedia
  - Wikipedia and Critique of Western Knowledge Production: The
  predominance of textual or linguistic cultures, post-western knowledge
  production systems, and indigenous knowledge systems
  - Wiki Art: Art that uses Wikipedia models, structures or data to explore
  and expand the practice of Wikipedia project; and accounts that document
  Wikipedia based art practices or debates
  - Designing Debate: Suggestions, innovations, critiques and ideas that
  focus on the design and form of the Wikipedia, to explore the claims of
  neutrality, objectivity, emergent hierarchy, control and authenticity on
the
  Wikipedia
  - Critique of Free and Open: Areas like Wikipedia governance, economic
  practices of and around Wikipedia, and the nature of freedom in usage,
  production and participation on the Wikipedia
  - Global Politics of Exclusion: Exploring questions of non-western
  material inclusion, language, connectedness, oral histories, women,
  non-geeks, and alternative material that cannot be documented on Wikipedia
  etc.
  - The Place of Resistance: Space of resistance and dissent in the
  Wikipedia, structures that allow for alternative voices, experiences and
  ideas
  - Wikipedia and Education: Wikipedia usage in classrooms as a teaching
  resource, and its effect on pedagogy, the role of Wikipedia in the
knowledge
  production sector, and mobilisation of academic communities around the
  Wikipedia
