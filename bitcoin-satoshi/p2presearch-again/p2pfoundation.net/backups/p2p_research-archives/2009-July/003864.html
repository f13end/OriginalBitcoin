<PRE>Hi Paul,

as usual, most interesting ...

it goes in too many directions to publish on the blog

would you consider a more tighter piece around the theme, 'p2p FOR national
security', I think that kind of message is important,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i> Here are some comments on the p2p file sharing issue from my own thinking

</I>&gt;<i> software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, and mostly unrelated, one witness is listed as from &quot;Center for the
</I>&gt;<i> Study of Digital Property&quot;. Well, as Richard Stallman suggests, calling
</I>&gt;<i> something &quot;property&quot; begs the question of how it should be treated by
</I>&gt;<i> society. But, if it is &quot;property', then how about taxing it annually?

</I>&gt;<i> Let's see how fast we can get copyright and patent lawyers to say, &quot;Oh, no,
</I>&gt;<i> that's not what we meant by property. You can't tax Micky Mouse; it's just
</I>&gt;<i> that he's like real estate only when it benefits us.&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, and on to my main points, there are serious security risks to any
</I>&gt;<i> system attached to the internet, obviously. So, the basis of this hearing
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> not without some merit.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeWire#Criticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeWire#Criticism</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing#Risks">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing#Risks</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, what is left out of the equation in terms of balance is how
</I>&gt;<i> intentional
</I>&gt;<i> sharing of information on peer-to-peer networks can enhance national and
</I>&gt;<i> global security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For one example, one of the biggest early users of the Groove peer-to-peer
</I>&gt;<i> software for collaboration was the US Defense Department. That itself
</I>&gt;<i> caused
</I>&gt;<i> some other issues:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Software Pioneer Quits Board of Groove&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/business/11PRIV.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/business/11PRIV.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mitchell D. Kapor, a personal computer industry software pioneer and a
</I>&gt;<i> civil liberties activist, has resigned from the board of Groove Networks
</I>&gt;<i> after learning that the company's software was being used by the Pentagon
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> part of its development of a domestic surveillance system. Mr. Kapor would
</I>&gt;<i> say publicly only that it was a &quot;delicate subject&quot; and that he had resigned
</I>&gt;<i> to pursue his interests in open source software. ... However, a person
</I>&gt;<i> close
</I>&gt;<i> to Mr. Kapor said that he was uncomfortable with the fact that Groove
</I>&gt;<i> Networks' desktop collaboration software was a crucial component of the
</I>&gt;<i> antiterrorist surveillance software being tested at the Defense Advanced
</I>&gt;<i> Research Project Agency's Information Awareness Office, an office directed
</I>&gt;<i> by Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter. ... &quot;With the dramatic change of funding
</I>&gt;<i> availability in the high-tech sector, it's become difficult for companies
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> turn down the funding opportunities presented by the federal government,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center
</I>&gt;<i> in Washington. &quot;It does show that some people in the high-tech community,
</I>&gt;<i> including some of the founders, are not happy with what's happening.&quot; ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the interests of full disclosure, we did work on aspects of that system.

</I>&gt;<i> However, my wife (an independent contractor) was upfront with Mr. P. about
</I>&gt;<i> her focus of getting people to see things from multiple perspectives and
</I>&gt;<i> working towards increasing global compassion. A more general effort she had
</I>&gt;<i> helped with even before 9/11 had failed afterwards in convincing the
</I>&gt;<i> Something-in-Chief that an activity like invading Iraq would be a really bad
</I>&gt;<i> idea, with the resulting waste of the lives of thousands of idealistic
</I>&gt;<i> young US Americans (and tens of thousands of US injured, many severely),
</I>&gt;<i> let
</I>&gt;<i> alone hundreds of thousands of Iraqi fatalities and injuries and millions
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> refugees), as well as trillions of US dollars in costs by the time it is
</I>&gt;<i> over (an expense which causes its own suffering to the people of the USA).
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, some official people wanted to get some information
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> that Lyme-addled mind of his about geopolitical reality using better
</I>&gt;<i> presentation methods. The rest is my speculation based on later events. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bush+lyme">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bush+lyme</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish now I had taken her work even more seriously back then. By the way,
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. ex-appointed-President, you might wish to read this book I've found
</I>&gt;<i> helpful myself:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Healing Lyme: Natural Healing And Prevention of Lyme Borreliosis And Its
</I>&gt;<i> Coinfections &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Lyme-Prevention-Borreliosis-Coinfections/dp/0970869630">http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Lyme-Prevention-Borreliosis-Coinfections/dp/0970869630</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (It's an approach that relies mostly on Chinese-style herbs, as the
</I>&gt;<i> standard
</I>&gt;<i> medical treatments often don't work, perhaps because Lyme was possibly
</I>&gt;<i> weaponized at Plum Island to be more awful?) I can only think (maybe in
</I>&gt;<i> error) that such sensemaking and presentation ideas and technologies as
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> developed on that project (of which surveillance was only part) might have
</I>&gt;<i> been of some small value in the fortunate prevention of follow-on US
</I>&gt;<i> invasions into Iran and Syria which, depending on what sort of stuff those
</I>&gt;<i> two countries keep in their refrigerators
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> refrigerators),

</I>&gt;<i> such invasions might in the worst case have led to another depopulation of

</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squanto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squanto</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Which shows the potential value sometimes in seeing things from other
</I>&gt;<i> people's points of view, or better yet, working towards mutual security
</I>&gt;<i> among peers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mitch Kapor made his decision. We made (or drifted into) ours. Whether it
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> easy to know who was right (even both, or neither) can be a tough call.
</I>&gt;<i> It's
</I>&gt;<i> also not always clear who is the real troublemakers in one of these
</I>&gt;<i> situations. Or the real patriots. Or who are just the people trying to
</I>&gt;<i> survive and muddle through in a mysterious and often confusing universe
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be unimaginably old and unimaginably big and yet still somehow
</I>&gt;<i> seems to fit inside a human skull. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People sent a letter to President Johnson about this sort of stuff in 1964,
</I>&gt;<i> so it's not like it is anything new, even if that letter is no doubt long
</I>&gt;<i> forgotten by most:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triple_Revolution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triple_Revolution</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The statement identified three revolutions underway in the world: the
</I>&gt;<i> cybernation revolution of increasing automation; the weaponry revolution of
</I>&gt;<i> mutually assured destruction; and the human rights revolution. It discussed
</I>&gt;<i> primarily the cybernation revolution.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.educationanddemocracy.org/FSCfiles/C_CC2a_TripleRevolution.htm">http://www.educationanddemocracy.org/FSCfiles/C_CC2a_TripleRevolution.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Weaponry Revolution: New forms of weaponry have been developed which
</I>&gt;<i> cannot win wars but which can obliterate civilization. We are recognizing
</I>&gt;<i> only now that the great weapons have eliminated war as a method for
</I>&gt;<i> resolving international conflicts. The ever-present threat of total
</I>&gt;<i> destruction is tempered by the knowledge of the final futility of war. The
</I>&gt;<i> need of a &#8220;warless world&#8221; is generally recognized, though achieving it will
</I>&gt;<i> be a long and frustrating process.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Triple Revolution memorandum in three sentences above explains why the
</I>&gt;<i> USA's current defense policy of unilateral dominance is ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> suicidal.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, we get this machismo:

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> WASHINGTON, June 2, 2000 &#8211; &quot;Full-spectrum dominance&quot; is the key term in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Joint Vision 2020,&quot; the blueprint DoD will follow in the future. ...
</I>&gt;<i> Full-spectrum dominance means the ability of U.S. forces, operating alone
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> with allies, to defeat any adversary and control any situation across the
</I>&gt;<i> range of military operations.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah right, this from a military still bogged down in the deserts and
</I>&gt;<i> cities
</I>&gt;<i> of Iraq years later after a supposed &quot;mission accomplished&quot;, where Iraq as
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> country was not much of a threat or much of an oppositional force. These
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> the people who get (with interest on previous expenses and future incurred
</I>&gt;<i> obligations) about a trillion dollars a year of US tax dollars? This is the
</I>&gt;<i> best strategy US military planners can come up with to protect the US
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> from post-scarcity weapons like nukes, biowarfare, killer robots, and
</I>&gt;<i> information warfare in a very complex world facing economic collapse?
</I>&gt;<i> This is the best defense against the downsides of vast changes going on
</I>&gt;<i> now?
</I>&gt;<i> Antagonize and threaten the heck out of the rest of the world to the point
</I>&gt;<i> where most people globally think the USA is the biggest threat to world
</I>&gt;<i> peace? And now, indirectly threaten to shut down peer-to-peer networks that
</I>&gt;<i> might help build bridges across the globe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, what else could they do with a commander-in-chief who said stuff like
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Bush: 'Bring on' attackers of U.S. troops&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-07-02-bush-iraq-troops_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-07-02-bush-iraq-troops_x.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides impeachment?
</I>&gt;<i> (Ignoring this is doctrine originating from the Clinton/Gore years. Or that
</I>&gt;<i> we have a different president now.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a better military strategy based on keeping relations between peers
</I>&gt;<i> going indefinitely:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;James P. Carse, Religious War In Light of the Infinite Game, SALT talk&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-962221125884493114">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-962221125884493114</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, from Morton Deutsch, a focus on mutual security among peers:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Beyond Intractability: Morton Deutsch&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.beyondintractability.org/audio/morton_deutsch/?nid=2430">http://www.beyondintractability.org/audio/morton_deutsch/?nid=2430</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Q: You're starting to see the analogy to international conflict, or
</I>&gt;<i> intractable conflict on a larger scale?
</I>&gt;<i> A: Yes. Well, I wrote a paper about preventing World War III. That was
</I>&gt;<i> during the height of the cold war, I think I wrote it in 1982, it was
</I>&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Presidential Address to the International Society to Political
</I>&gt;<i> Psychology.&quot; And there I took the relationship between the United States
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> the Soviet Union and characterized it as a malignant relationship, which
</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i> some of the characteristics that I was talking about with the couple. It
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> right for both the United States and the Soviet Union to think that the
</I>&gt;<i> other was hostile, would undo it, would damage it, you know, all of these
</I>&gt;<i> things. The relationship was a malignant one. They had to become aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the malignancy, and the only way out really was recognizing that it's
</I>&gt;<i> hurting, recognizing that there is a potential better way of relating. And
</I>&gt;<i> that better way of relating involves having a sense that one can only have
</I>&gt;<i> security if there's mutual security. And that's true in most relationships.
</I>&gt;<i> That's particularly true to recognize groups that have had bitter strife
</I>&gt;<i> where they've hurt each other. They have to deal with the problem of how to
</I>&gt;<i> get to where they can live together. It may be ethnic groups within a given
</I>&gt;<i> nation or community. They can only live together if they recognize that
</I>&gt;<i> their own security is going to be dependent on the other person's security.
</I>&gt;<i> So each person, each side, each group has to be interested in the welfare
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the other. On a national level it has to deal with military and other
</I>&gt;<i> economic security. At the group level and personal level, it often has to
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> with psychological security. It has to do with someone recognizing, I
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be treating the other in an undignified, disrespectful way. So in
</I>&gt;<i> an interpersonal relationship, that kind of security, recognizing that not
</I>&gt;<i> only are you entitled to it, so is the other person entitled to it. And if
</I>&gt;<i> you don't give that other person that entitlement the relationship is going
</I>&gt;<i> to move in the other direction, back to bitter conflict.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or even from the book Disciplined Minds, on how individuals can help
</I>&gt;<i> promote a better balance of meshwork-and-hierarchy among peers:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Review of Jeff Schmidt's Disciplined Minds: A Critical Look at Salaried
</I>&gt;<i> Professionals and the Soul-Battering System that Shapes their Lives&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01BRrt.html">http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01BRrt.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, Schmidt describes what is involved in being a radical
</I>&gt;<i> professional:
</I>&gt;<i> identifying primarily as a radical, having a critical perspective on the
</I>&gt;<i> profession and institution, and doing things that make a difference, by
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to opposition groups and working on the inside. For most
</I>&gt;<i> teachers, then, doing things that make a difference would mean working in
</I>&gt;<i> radical ways within a mainstream school. Schmidt gives a list of 33
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions for radical professionals working in establishment
</I>&gt;<i> institutions,
</I>&gt;<i> such as helping on politically progressive projects during working hours,
</I>&gt;<i> exposing the organization&#8217;s flaws to outsiders, and taking collective
</I>&gt;<i> action
</I>&gt;<i> to maintain the dignity of individuals. These are all eminently practical
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions. Schmidt does not present a grand plan to transform professions
</I>&gt;<i> or society. Rather, his suggestions, like his analysis, are grounded in
</I>&gt;<i> day-to-day realities. That is what makes Disciplined Minds a really
</I>&gt;<i> subversive book, much more so than other books that may seem more radical
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical terms but lack a tight connection to practice. How far to
</I>&gt;<i> pursue
</I>&gt;<i> any subversive step is a matter of judgment, and here Schmidt cannot
</I>&gt;<i> provide
</I>&gt;<i> much guidance since so much depends on an individual&#8217;s circumstances,
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities, understanding, skills and alternatives. It is usually safer
</I>&gt;<i> to be an activist about distant issues than confront the local power
</I>&gt;<i> structure. Is this a cop-out? Going too far means risking one&#8217;s job and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly the opportunity to pursue further change, but treading too softly
</I>&gt;<i> is a prescription for gradually becoming a defender of the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i> Schmidt encourages us to err on the side of action for change.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course, IMHO, the biggest creative challenge is ideally to find a
</I>&gt;<i> path that both fulfills your hierarchically assigned task in a respectful
</I>&gt;<i> way while at the same time moves towards some larger goal of mutual
</I>&gt;<i> security
</I>&gt;<i> and global abundance in an open and upfront way that the hierarchy has no
</I>&gt;<i> significant justifiable reason to confront or impede, as you help restore a
</I>&gt;<i> balance to the world. I'm proud that my wife found such a path for a time
</I>&gt;<i> under difficult conditions, as fraught with ethical dilemmas as it has been:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Trickster-Makes-This-World-Mischief/dp/0865475369">http://www.amazon.com/Trickster-Makes-This-World-Mischief/dp/0865475369</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.ted.com/2009/04/trickster_makes.php">http://blog.ted.com/2009/04/trickster_makes.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The trickster is anybody who's a bit of an outsider. They're the ones who
</I>&gt;<i> make change. They're not thinking about making change; they're almost doing
</I>&gt;<i> it in a selfish way. But because they're working outside the rules, they
</I>&gt;<i> change the rules. Everything around them is always new, everything is an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity. It's important to honor mischief-making, in a constructive and
</I>&gt;<i> creative way, because that's how we effect change. And it's so important
</I>&gt;<i> that we figure out our inner mischief maker. That's the creative part of
</I>&gt;<i> us.
</I>&gt;<i> And everybody's capable of it.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, what I'm saying is that most US Americans may already owe their lives
</I>&gt;<i> to the result of a project involving peer-to-peer technology. And maybe
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> to an all-too-clever person who organized it and who had previously been
</I>&gt;<i> convicted of multiple felonies (for IMHO apparently justifiable reasons):

</I>&gt;<i> Politics makes strange bedfellows and combined actions can often have
</I>&gt;<i> unintended consequences. :-) Even this one.
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Where does the phrase &quot;politics makes strange bedfellows&quot; come from?&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not that all this is anything I'd be able to prove myself, or even can be
</I>&gt;<i> 100% certain of as it is a complex chain of events involving lots of people
</I>&gt;<i> and some degree of uncertainty as regards the capabilities of secretive
</I>&gt;<i> countries, as well as the fact that more ordinary explanations might help
</I>&gt;<i> explain stopping at Iraq. And I saw it all from a distance. But it does
</I>&gt;<i> sound strange enough to be plausible, right? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond peer-to-peer tools used directly in acknowledged conventional
</I>&gt;<i> national security situations, if peer-to-peer tools are used to develop an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative and more intrinsically secure infrastructure for the USA and
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> world, one supporting mutual security and global prosperity, the overall
</I>&gt;<i> security benefits due to peer-to-peer may be enormous. That sort of idea of
</I>&gt;<i> developing an intrinsically secure and sustainable infrastructure for
</I>&gt;<i> global
</I>&gt;<i> abundance is what I would like to use peer-to-peer systems for. So, one
</I>&gt;<i> needs to balance the benefits of peer-to-peer against the risks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone wants security. We often just define it differently using
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions. For example, I believe that it is foolish to spend vast
</I>&gt;<i> amounts
</I>&gt;<i> per year extrinsically defending the Persian Gulf oil fields (where much of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;our&quot; oil in the USA comes from) when just a few years of such expenses
</I>&gt;<i> could insulate enough homes in the USA and upgrade enough cars to
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically reduce the need to import any of that oil at all. I am
</I>&gt;<i> (personally) concerned about energy security, but looking at it from a
</I>&gt;<i> different perspective, based on Amory and Hunter Lovins' ideas
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_Power">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_Power</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security is a 1982 book by
</I>&gt;<i> Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins, prepared originally as a Pentagon
</I>&gt;<i> study, and re-released in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. The book
</I>&gt;<i> argues that domestic energy infrastructure is very vulnerable to
</I>&gt;<i> disruption,
</I>&gt;<i> by accident or malice, often even more so than imported oil. According to
</I>&gt;<i> the authors, a resilient energy system is feasible, costs less, works
</I>&gt;<i> better, is favoured in the market, but is rejected by U.S. policy. In the
</I>&gt;<i> preface to the 2001 edition, Lovins explains that these themes are still
</I>&gt;<i> very current.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, sometimes peer-to-peer efforts can take the security high ground. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that's exactly the sort of soft energy paths that Amory and Hunter
</I>&gt;<i> Lovins recommended the USA adopt thirty years ago. Unfortunately, that
</I>&gt;<i> advice was not followed quickly enough, although now many are listening to
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course, email is essentially peer-to-peer. And almost everyone uses
</I>&gt;<i> that. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Michel has said elsewhere, peer-to-peer is more about a relationship
</I>&gt;<i> between people than whether there is a server somewhere in the middle.
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Michel Bauwens Explains Peer-to-Peer&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google Wave is peer-to-peer in that sense too. As is Wikipedia too, in a
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Little Big Planet is a somewhat peer-to-peer application in that sense --
</I>&gt;<i> with the motto, &quot;Play, Create, Share&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in
</I>&gt;<i> North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3
</I>&gt;<i> million
</I>&gt;<i> unique users playing LittleBigPlanet.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, the rest of the world may not see it that way yet. By the phrasing
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the meeting title, this does seem like something of a witch hunt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One can also talk about p2p risks to your own personal security. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I believe this is a bad law, intentionally violating copyrights is
</I>&gt;<i> now
</I>&gt;<i> a felony in the USA. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/CFAleghist.htm">http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/CFAleghist.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And there are other types of content that are also illegal in the USA.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I would not run a peer-to-peer content hosting system like
</I>&gt;<i> LimeWire or similar things where I was not reasonably sure of what content
</I>&gt;<i> it was hosting, or where I was not sure where it was taking any content
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> on my own system, or where the source code or traffic was not inspectable,
</I>&gt;<i> or where the collective content was not vetted by an active community
</I>&gt;<i> process, or where I did not have time and energy to supervise it. So, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't run one. :-) Still, that does not mean whether I think such systems
</I>&gt;<i> are legal or not; I'm just being extra cautious, and I don't see any
</I>&gt;<i> significant personal value for me to take on any risk in that area. Others
</I>&gt;<i> might make that decision differently for legitimate reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I personally prefer a workgroup model of peer-to-peer instead of
</I>&gt;<i> supporting sort of anonymous network for arbitrary content cached locally
</I>&gt;<i> like much software called peer-to-peer file sharing tools. A workgroup
</I>&gt;<i> model
</I>&gt;<i> system is what I am working towards with the Pointrel Social Semantic
</I>&gt;<i> Desktop, where people would decide who is in a workgroup and what content
</I>&gt;<i> was worked on in a workgroup (similar to a mailing list in that sense).
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointrel/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointrel/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have considered (in theory) a possible way to use Gnutella and similar
</I>&gt;<i> file sharing networks as one of many backends for coordinating shared
</I>&gt;<i> content (currently all the implemented ones are central server based in
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> way or just involve copying files from a shared drive). But having such a
</I>&gt;<i> backend is not a priority for me to implement or use myself. Down the road,
</I>&gt;<i> that might change if there was some big value there, but it is so hard to
</I>&gt;<i> get anything going well, it's not an area I want to explore right now given
</I>&gt;<i> extra controversy and risk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I became interested in this model in part because of concerns about
</I>&gt;<i> the types of designs people might put in a related system I wanted to do
</I>&gt;<i> called OSCOMAK, related to free and open source physical technology. That
</I>&gt;<i> project has had a trial Halo Semantic MediaWiki website (without too much
</I>&gt;<i> success).
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.oscomak.net/">http://www.oscomak.net/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It took a lot of time to deal with spammers to it too, and I just keep it
</I>&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;<i> now for archival purposes without allowing more changes. I also don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to host designs I don't approve of (most likely advanced weapons or various
</I>&gt;<i> controversial biotech things). That does not mean others might not want to
</I>&gt;<i> host various designs, of course based on different values or evaluations of
</I>&gt;<i> risk (for example, explosives are used in mining, but I'm not interested in
</I>&gt;<i> worrying about them and all the security implications). Again, it's so hard
</I>&gt;<i> to get any content together, and I don't want to get bogged down in
</I>&gt;<i> controversies about military or dual-use products or other issues from the
</I>&gt;<i> start. I'd rather focus on the low hanging non-controversial fruit of
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward helpful technology (if there is any such thing in the end?
</I>&gt;<i> Tea cosies, perhaps? :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though even a workgroup has its sinister sounding side depending on how
</I>&gt;<i> people decide to share their workgroup results or how open they make
</I>&gt;<i> invitations to workgroups. One term there is &quot;darknet&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing</A>)&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_%28file_sharing%29</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A darknet refers to any type of closed, private group of people
</I>&gt;<i> communicating; however, since 2002, the term has evolved to more
</I>&gt;<i> specifically refer to file sharing networks in general, whether that
</I>&gt;<i> network
</I>&gt;<i> is private or (without respect to the legality of such) readily accessible
</I>&gt;<i> to the public. The phrase &quot;the darknet&quot; is used to refer collectively to
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> covert communication networks.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most corporate communication systems could be considered &quot;darknets&quot; in that
</I>&gt;<i> sense to an extent (as in, the public can't join in the network or access
</I>&gt;<i> most of the content). And lots of web applications are like that, even
</I>&gt;<i> private Google Groups or private Yahoo Groups. Yes, I know often people
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> to use that term to mean something about the network or encryption more
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> the accessibility of the content, but it's kind of like seeing the peer
</I>&gt;<i> aspect more than the transport or server aspect as defining peer-to-peer.
</I>&gt;<i> Although friend-to-friend is also another way of looking at this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not expect any data transmitted over public networks, even
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> data, to be secure in the long term. Much stuff is undoubtedly archived,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> quantum computing could in theory easily break any current crypto anyone is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to really use. As I've said elsewhere,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/openmanufacturing/msg/ae28e8971f8f9669?hl=en">http://groups.google.com/group/openmanufacturing/msg/ae28e8971f8f9669?hl=en</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I think activists should make their plans and conduct their lives under the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption the intelligence agencies are watching everything they do. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not saying that is the actual case; I'm just saying it is the safest
</I>&gt;<i> assumption, and I doubt much is gained of practical value assuming
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> anyway (and some of value might even be lost, a chance to change opinions
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the watchers). See:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Social Movements and Strategic Nonviolence&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_nonviolence.html">http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/change/science_nonviolence.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure people can make arguments for these other systems with anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> content broadly distributed, but it is not a space I personally want to be
</I>&gt;<i> in. I'd rather see places like Wikipedia or ibiblio or Wikileaks with
</I>&gt;<i> significant legal backup dealing with these issues of free speech or
</I>&gt;<i> defending marginal content. Getting entangled in one of those issues early
</I>&gt;<i> on is probably just a project hinderance as far as worry and divided
</I>&gt;<i> attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, one can also make arguments for principled civil disobedience
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> regard to infringing on copyrighted material or software patents (including
</I>&gt;<i> by using peer-to-peer networks or tools), but that is not on my own
</I>&gt;<i> priority
</I>&gt;<i> list, given there is so much one can do within the law. The most popular
</I>&gt;<i> content people want to share (mainstream music, movies) really ideally
</I>&gt;<i> should be replaced with peer produced content IMHO, as it often reflects a
</I>&gt;<i> certain set of values and world view. Fair use for parody or commentary or
</I>&gt;<i> maybe even mixups may be a different issue than sharing commercially
</I>&gt;<i> produced copyrighted works as-is, but at least in the USA, some of that may
</I>&gt;<i> be legal. A different issue is the archiving or sharing of copyrighted
</I>&gt;<i> material that is decades old and has had its copyright period extended by
</I>&gt;<i> legal changes after its creation, given that you would think copyrights
</I>&gt;<i> should be shorter in the fast-moving internet age than the twenty years or
</I>&gt;<i> so common in the age of steamships and the pony express; but it might take
</I>&gt;<i> another Supreme Court case to decide the legality of those laws under that
</I>&gt;<i> test (Lawrence Lessig flubbed the last one). Likewise, materials developed
</I>&gt;<i> in part using taxpayer or charitable funds might be in a different category
</I>&gt;<i> too, given that the public has already paid for them in some way (another
</I>&gt;<i> Supreme Court case?). I'm not recommending infringing on any copyrights;
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just suggesting these different situations all might be thought about
</I>&gt;<i> differently as one thinks about how the laws should change to better
</I>&gt;<i> reflect
</I>&gt;<i> peer-oriented values, or in contemplating which laws might in theory be
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> worthy of principled civil disobedience than others for those willing to do
</I>&gt;<i> jail time for a felony charge with hopes of changing the law if it is
</I>&gt;<i> unconstitutional or significantly against the public interest.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=felony+copyright+infringement">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=felony+copyright+infringement</A>
</I>&gt;<i> However, again, I am not encouraging anyone to break the law (and most US
</I>&gt;<i> prisons are nasty places to be); I'm just pointing out the issue and how
</I>&gt;<i> civil disobedience is one I am not interested in pursuing myself given I
</I>&gt;<i> feel there are so many other alternatives one can do within the (bad) law.
</I>&gt;<i> If anything, I'd suggest people think long and hard before violating any
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights as there is rarely any reason that makes any sense given there
</I>&gt;<i> are lots of free alternatives for most things these days -- even music and
</I>&gt;<i> video, and if something is not free that you want it, it might be better to
</I>&gt;<i> just make a free alternative of some sort and route around the damage of
</I>&gt;<i> overly long copyright. Look at what Wikipedia has accomplished. For
</I>&gt;<i> reference on this topic:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws, demands and
</I>&gt;<i> commands of a government, or of an occupying power, without resorting to
</I>&gt;<i> physical violence. It is one of the primary tactics of nonviolent
</I>&gt;<i> resistance. In its most nonviolent form (in India, known as ahimsa or
</I>&gt;<i> satyagraha) it could be said that it is compassion in the form of
</I>&gt;<i> respectful
</I>&gt;<i> disagreement.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One aspect I'm more interested in about licensing is tagging copyrighted
</I>&gt;<i> content in various ways to know if it does not have a free license so it
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> be more easily purged from a peer workgroup focusing on free content. That
</I>&gt;<i> is sort of like a free software version of DRM for peer-to-peer systems,
</I>&gt;<i> looking at non-free content as contaminated stuff you want to get rid of as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as possible, or maybe even filter out before it reaches your systems,
</I>&gt;<i> as you treat non-free stuff as damage and work around it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;License management tools: good, bad, or ugly?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.misc.discuss/browse_thread/thread/df4b4363d544f766/1e499c6db59117a2">http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.misc.discuss/browse_thread/thread/df4b4363d544f766/1e499c6db59117a2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you could set things up so your email client (or mailing list) would
</I>&gt;<i> only accept emails that came with certain free licenses. :-) So, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> use DRM to enforce restrictions on distributing content, you could use it
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent accepting content with restrictions on redistribution.

</I>&gt;<i> worth fighting anyway. Does that make me a fuddy duddy? :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I still find the title of the meeting worrisome, of course. I guess
