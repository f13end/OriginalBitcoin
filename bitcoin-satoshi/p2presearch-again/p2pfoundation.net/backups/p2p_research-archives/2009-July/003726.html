I wish I had written it myself.  Excellent points all.

</I>&gt;<i>  Below is Dean Baker&#8217;s contribution&lt;<A HREF="http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21756">http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21756</A>&gt;to the Re-Imagining Society debate at ZNet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Dean Baker:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&#8220;As every backcountry hiker recognizes, you must first know where you are
</I>&gt;<i> before you can figure out how to get to where you want to be. While it is
</I>&gt;<i> important to know where we want to go, progressives often badly
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstand where we are now.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Specifically, much of the anger of progressives is wrongly focused on the
</I>&gt;<i> market, as though the market is the source of the troubles in the world.
</I>&gt;<i> Progressive publications have featured endless diatribes against &#8220;market
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentalism,&#8221; implying that the strict devotion to market principles is
</I>&gt;<i> the core problem that we must counter.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In fact, the market is not the problem. The market is a tool, like the
</I>&gt;<i> wheel. It makes as much sense to attack the market as it does to attack the
</I>&gt;<i> wheel.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The problem is in how the market has been structured. The right has used
</I>&gt;<i> its control of the government to structure the market in ways that
</I>&gt;<i> redistribute income upward and produce many other bad outcomes, like poverty
</I>&gt;<i> in the developing world and global warming.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Progressives fall into the right&#8217;s trap when we imply that these outcomes
</I>&gt;<i> are simply the result of the natural workings of the market, and that our
</I>&gt;<i> opponents have a rigid adherence to market principles. Poverty and
</I>&gt;<i> inequality are not inevitable outcomes of a market economy; they result from
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the market was rigged to produce these outcomes. Furthermore,
</I>&gt;<i> our opponents absolutely do not have a rigid adherence to market principles.
</I>&gt;<i> They have a rigid adherence to policies that redistribute income upward.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Our efforts must be focused first and foremost on combating the ways in
</I>&gt;<i> which the wealthy have rigged to the deck to ensure that the market will
</I>&gt;<i> favor their interests. This is the best immediate path forward and will also
</I>&gt;<i> provide the basis for a clearer understanding of where we might ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> hope to go.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *How the Wealthy Rig the Deck*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Conservatives are fond of highlighting the self-made person: someone who
</I>&gt;<i> starts from humble beginnings and through talent and hard work manages to
</I>&gt;<i> accumulate enormous wealth. While their poster children may be genuinely
</I>&gt;<i> talented and hardworking, behind any &#8220;self-made&#8221; person one can almost
</I>&gt;<i> always find the big hand of the government.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *For example, Bill Gates rise from moderate affluence to incredible wealth
</I>&gt;<i> was only possible because of government granted copyright monopolies on
</I>&gt;<i> computer software. The government would arrest anyone who makes and
</I>&gt;<i> distributes copies of Windows and other Microsoft software without Bill
</I>&gt;<i> Gates&#8217; permission. As a result of this copyright monopoly, Microsoft became
</I>&gt;<i> one of the most profitable companies in the world as the use of personal
</I>&gt;<i> computers exploded over the last quarter century.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *While conservatives would have us believe that copyrights came down from
</I>&gt;<i> heaven, in fact, copyrights are a form of government granted monopoly. They
</I>&gt;<i> serve an important public purpose; they provide an incentive for creative
</I>&gt;<i> and artistic work, but this does not change the fact that copyrights are
</I>&gt;<i> instruments of government policy, not inherent attributes of a market
</I>&gt;<i> economy.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Real market fundamentalists do not believe in copyrights. They believe
</I>&gt;<i> that the market will provide sufficient incentives to promote creative work
</I>&gt;<i> without government granted copyright monopolies. If the country were
</I>&gt;<i> actually run by market fundamentalists, then Bill Gates would have to work
</I>&gt;<i> for a living.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The same applies to patent protection. This is most important in the case
</I>&gt;<i> of prescription drugs. The United States now spends more than $250 billion a
</I>&gt;<i> year on drugs ($3,200 for a family of four). These drugs would cost about
</I>&gt;<i> one tenth of this amount in the absence of patent protection.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This is demonstrated by the fact that many chain drug stores now sell
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of generic drugs for $4 a prescription and sometimes less. The
</I>&gt;<i> drugs available at $4 per prescription are not chemically distinct as a
</I>&gt;<i> group from the brand drugs that can sell for hundreds of dollars per
</I>&gt;<i> prescription. The only difference is that the latter are subject to patent
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly protection by the government.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This is not only a question of dollars and cents; it is a question of
</I>&gt;<i> lives, especially in the developing world where patent protection often
</I>&gt;<i> makes drugs unaffordable for much of the population. However, even in the
</I>&gt;<i> United States millions of people have great difficulty paying for drugs they
</I>&gt;<i> need for their life or health.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Patent protection does serve an important purpose in providing an
</I>&gt;<i> incentive to develop new drugs, but again this is a question of public
</I>&gt;<i> policy, it is not an intrinsic feature of the market. There are other, far
</I>&gt;<i> more efficient ways to support research into the development of new drugs.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, we could set up prize funds to reward important innovations as
</I>&gt;<i> has been proposed by Nobel Prize winner Joe Stiglitz and others.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *We could also just have the government pay for the cost of developing
</I>&gt;<i> prescription drugs up front, as it does when it pays out $30 billion a year
</I>&gt;<i> for biomedical research conducted by the National Institutes of Health. In
</I>&gt;<i> either case, once the research is funded, the drugs developed could then be
</I>&gt;<i> sold in a competitive market for $4 per prescription, just like generics.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Of course, these mechanisms would likely mean much lower profits for
</I>&gt;<i> Pfizer, Merck and the other big pharmaceutical companies. But Pfizer, Merck
</I>&gt;<i> and their political allies are not being market fundamentalists. They are
</I>&gt;<i> fighting to protect government intervention that benefits them.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The government granted monopolies through &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; are far
</I>&gt;<i> from the only mechanism by which the government redistributes income upward.
</I>&gt;<i> The collapse of the financial sector and the subsequent government bailout
</I>&gt;<i> revealed a whole set of implicit guarantees that supported the profitability
</I>&gt;<i> of the financial industry. Lenders could feel safe in lending money to Bear
</I>&gt;<i> Stearns, AIG, Citigroup and the rest (except Lehman) because they correctly
</I>&gt;<i> believed that the government would never allow these financial giants to
</I>&gt;<i> fail.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This guarantee meant higher returns for bondholders, since the government
</I>&gt;<i> effectively subsidized their investments. More importantly, it allowed for
</I>&gt;<i> the top executives at the banks to earn enormous pay packages, since the
</I>&gt;<i> government was giving them a guarantee that allowed them to speculate with
</I>&gt;<i> other people&#8217;s money. The Wall Street crew might mutter about deregulation
</I>&gt;<i> and letting the market take its course, but in reality they are big-time
</I>&gt;<i> dependents of the government. To the financial industry, &#8220;deregulation&#8221; just
</I>&gt;<i> means that they want their government subsidies with no strings attached.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In fact, at an even more basic level, the corporation itself is a
</I>&gt;<i> creation of the government. Individuals can act on their own to form
</I>&gt;<i> partnerships, but the creation of an entity that has a completely distinct
</I>&gt;<i> legal status from its owners requires the intervention of the government.
</I>&gt;<i> Corporate charters were originally only granted to companies that were
</I>&gt;<i> deemed to fulfill a specific social purpose such as improving transportation
</I>&gt;<i> by building turnpikes, canals, and railroads or expanding trade.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This point is important. The creation of corporations, like copyrights
</I>&gt;<i> and patents, were explicit government policy. They are not intrinsic to the
</I>&gt;<i> market. Genuine market fundamentalists wouldn&#8217;t want to see the government
</I>&gt;<i> granting legal personage and limited liability to artificial entities like
</I>&gt;<i> corporations. Market fundamentalists would want individuals to freely
</I>&gt;<i> associate in business as partnerships that don&#8217;t receive special privileges
</I>&gt;<i> from the government.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The structure of international trade is also determined by the
</I>&gt;<i> government. The so-called &#8220;free trade&#8221; agenda of the last three decades in
</I>&gt;<i> reality has almost nothing to do with free trade. A main purpose of U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> trade policy has been to put U.S. manufacturing workers in direct
</I>&gt;<i> competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. This predicted
</I>&gt;<i> effect of this policy is to lower the wages of manufacturing workers and
</I>&gt;<i> non-college educated workers more generally. By depressing the wages of
</I>&gt;<i> these workers, as well as the prices of the goods and services that they
</I>&gt;<i> produce, this trade policy raises the real income of highly paid
</I>&gt;<i> professionals and those who get their income from capital. (If they pay less
</I>&gt;<i> for manufactured goods, and their income stays the same, then their real
</I>&gt;<i> income rises.)*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The structure of labor-management relations is another area of explicit
</I>&gt;<i> government intervention. If a union organizes its members to support the
</I>&gt;<i> strike of another union (i.e. a secondary boycott), the government will fine
</I>&gt;<i> the union and arrest its leaders. Free market fundamentalists should have no
</I>&gt;<i> objection to one group of workers opting to support another group of
</I>&gt;<i> workers. Once again, the policy in place has the effect of hurting ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> workers to the benefit of corporations, even at the expense of undermining a
</I>&gt;<i> commitment to the freedom of individuals.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Even the idea that the market fundamentalists refuse to consider
</I>&gt;<i> externalities can readily be shown to be utter nonsense. The market
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentalists absolutely insist on zoning restrictions that prohibit the
</I>&gt;<i> building of a slaughterhouse or steel factory in high-income neighborhoods.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, they generally support zoning that prohibits low-income housing in
</I>&gt;<i> their neighborhoods. They fully recognize the concept of externalities and
</I>&gt;<i> the role of government in controlling them. They just don&#8217;t want the
</I>&gt;<i> government restricting externalities in ways that reduce corporate profits.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In almost every area of public policy it is easy to show that the market
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentalists do not really favor leaving outcomes to the market. Rather
</I>&gt;<i> they want to set in place a structure that ensures market outcomes will
</I>&gt;<i> favor the wealthy. When progressives respond by criticizing the market, we
</I>&gt;<i> pursue a path this is both conceptually wrong and politically disastrous.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Market outcomes, as opposed to government directed policy, enjoy
</I>&gt;<i> substantial legitimacy among the public. Conservatives know this and milk
</I>&gt;<i> fears of stifling government bureaucracies to great effect. Rather than play
</I>&gt;<i> into the conservatives&#8217; trap, progressives should actively promote polices
</I>&gt;<i> that structure the markets in ways that help the vast majority, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> causing income to flow upward.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *For example, we should reject copyrights and drug patents as archaic
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms for supporting creative work and innovation. It easy to develop
</I>&gt;<i> market oriented policies that will more effectively promote creative work
</I>&gt;<i> and innovation and that are less likely to lead to vast fortunes being
</I>&gt;<i> accumulated in these areas.[i]*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *These policies will also have the enormous advantage of making the
</I>&gt;<i> world&#8217;s vast intellectual output available to everyone everywhere at almost
</I>&gt;<i> no cost. Imagine children in even the poorest developing countries being
</I>&gt;<i> able to get access to the web on computers or cell phones that are very
</I>&gt;<i> cheap, because they use open source software. Suppose they can then download
</I>&gt;<i> at no cost any book, newspaper, or journal article that has ever been
</I>&gt;<i> written, as well as any song, movie, or video. This would be a free market
</I>&gt;<i> outcome.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Suppose that the most effective drugs for treating any disease were
</I>&gt;<i> available at just the cost of manufacturing them, which would rarely be more
</I>&gt;<i> than a few dollars per prescription. Similarly, the price of most medical
</I>&gt;<i> tests and equipment would plunge to levels that made them seem unimportant,
</I>&gt;<i> if we had a free market in these areas rather than government patent
</I>&gt;<i> monopolies.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *We could quickly deflate the Wall Street boys and girls by taking away
</I>&gt;<i> their government security blanket. The obvious story here is that the
</I>&gt;<i> institutions that are &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; are run by the government, as is the
</I>&gt;<i> case now with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Otherwise, there should be a
</I>&gt;<i> credible commitment from the government that if large institutions get into
</I>&gt;<i> trouble, then they will fail and that their creditors will be out of luck.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *With corporations more generally, it is evident that the existing rules
</I>&gt;<i> are poorly designed for the current economic environment. Management has
</I>&gt;<i> come to control corporations and run them in their own interest, to the
</I>&gt;<i> detriment of the shareholders and other stakeholders (at least in the United
</I>&gt;<i> States). There are already elaborate rules on corporate governance that set
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions on what the insiders are allowed to do. These rules can be
</I>&gt;<i> restructured to limit the power of top corporate management, most
</I>&gt;<i> importantly the power to largely set its own pay.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *If rules of corporate governance required that compensation packages of
</I>&gt;<i> top executives were regularly sent out for shareholder approval, in
</I>&gt;<i> elections in which unreturned proxies do not count (it is currently standard
</I>&gt;<i> for management to count proxies that are not returned by shareholders as
</I>&gt;<i> supporting its position), it is likely that the multi-million dollar pay
</I>&gt;<i> packages of top executives would come back down to earth. The elimination of
</I>&gt;<i> bloated executive compensation packages in the corporate sector is also
</I>&gt;<i> likely to bring downward pressure on pay for top officers in hospitals,
</I>&gt;<i> universities, and even non-profits, since all of these institutions have
</I>&gt;<i> felt the need in recent decades to raise pay in order to stay in line with
</I>&gt;<i> the corporate world.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Trade can also used as a force to reduce inequality in the wealthy
</I>&gt;<i> countries and promote development in the poor countries. Current trade
</I>&gt;<i> policy only forces non-college educated workers to compete with their
</I>&gt;<i> low-paid counterparts in poor countries. However, we can also adopt &#8220;free
</I>&gt;<i> trade&#8221; policies that are structured toward putting our most highly paid
</I>&gt;<i> professionals (doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants) into direct
</I>&gt;<i> competition with highly paid professionals from the developing world.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *It is far cheaper to educate and train a doctor in the developing world
</I>&gt;<i> than in the United States. If honest economists were designing trade policy,
</I>&gt;<i> they would have focused on opening the door to professionals from the
</I>&gt;<i> developing world rather than creating structures to facilitate trade in
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured goods. Our policy should be focused on making it as easy for a
</I>&gt;<i> smart kid growing up in India or China to educate themselves to U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> standards and practice medicine and law in the United States, as it is for a
</I>&gt;<i> kid growing up in the Los Angeles suburbs.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *To ensure that developing countries benefit from this arrangement, a fee
</I>&gt;<i> can be attached to the pay of professionals trained in the developing world,
</I>&gt;<i> which will be paid to the home country. Given the outsized professional
</I>&gt;<i> salaries in the United States even a modest fee should be sufficient to pay
</I>&gt;<i> for the training of 2-3 professionals for every one that comes to the United
</I>&gt;<i> States. This should allow for better health care and other professional
</I>&gt;<i> services in the developing world, while hugely reducing the cost of medical
</I>&gt;<i> care and other professional services in the United States.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Another important change in government policy would be to have a central
</I>&gt;<i> bank (the Federal Reserve Board in the case of the United States) that is
</I>&gt;<i> more committed to sustaining high rates of employment than an arbitrary rate
</I>&gt;<i> of inflation. In addition to the strains directly associated with being
</I>&gt;<i> unemployed, high unemployment also puts downward pressure on the wages of
</I>&gt;<i> those at the middle and bottom of the wage distribution. If the Fed
</I>&gt;<i> consistently pursued monetary policies that were intended to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> unemployment rate low, it would create an economic environment that made it
</I>&gt;<i> easier for large segments of the workforce to enjoy rising living standards.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *There are many other policies that can be added to this list, but the
</I>&gt;<i> point is that these are all market-oriented policies that will help to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure progressive outcomes such as greater equality, better access to
</I>&gt;<i> health care, and increased economic security. We should not be afraid to use
</I>&gt;<i> the government directly where it provides the best solution. For example, a
</I>&gt;<i> government run Social Security system is far better and more efficient than
</I>&gt;<i> its private sector counterparts.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *However, this is not a matter or principle that separates progressives
</I>&gt;<i> from conservatives. Over the last three decades Conservatives have
</I>&gt;<i> aggressively used the government to structure the markets in ways that
</I>&gt;<i> redistribute income upward. If we don&#8217;t recognize this fact and stop calling
</I>&gt;<i> them &#8220;market fundamentalists&#8221; then all our visions will be illusions.&#8221;*
