<PRE>Hi P2P List,

Since Participation Camp, I've been working on a project called OpenKollab.
This message will give you some idea about it, but the documentation at
<A HREF="http://openkollab.com/">http://openkollab.com</A> breaks it down more.  We're having our weekly open
chat session in Skype (email me your Skype name for an invite - we'll be
migrating to IRC starting next week FYI) tomorrow 7/29 at 15:00 GMT.  Would
love to hear your thoughts here or in any of the channels over at
OpenKollab.  I'm really excited about the group that's gathered around this,
and the degree of focus we've achieved.

Best,
Matt

WHATS HAPPENING WITH OPENKOLLAB
The follow up to Pcamp (<A HREF="http://mudball.net/pcamp09/">http://mudball.net/pcamp09/</A>) has now resulted
in the formation of a team (Matt, Tav, Michael, Stephan, Gerry and
Suresh) that are working on developing an initiative called
OpenKollab. OpenKollab Project will help organizations that are
strategically aligned explore potential working relationships. It will
do this by identifying groups with related goals, highlighting
opportunities for resource sharing between those groups, and making it
easy for those groups to hold a productive virtual meeting. OpenKollab
is both a community process and a platform. While you all are invited
to take part in building the community and thinking through the
platform needs, Tav and his crew of Espians - a group of visionary
technologists that are working on developing a next generation
architecture to support distributed real time collaboration and
community formation - have agreed to build parts of the platform.


AGENDA FOR WEDNESDAYS MEETING
This Wednesday, we are going to focus our discussion on:
-The OpenKollab Platform: What do our web services do now, and what
will they do in the future?
-The Roadmap: What is our longer term plan?
-Project Mapping: How will we gather the necessary information to map
projects and realte them to each other?


OUR UNIQUE SYSTEM FOR RELATING PROJECTS
Our next project is to create a standard format for structuring
information about projects.  Once projects are listed in this format,
it's easier to see how they fit together.

The OpenKollab Project's own listing looks like this:
&#183;       Needs: project mappers, funding support,
&#183;       Resources: a place to list your project, share it with a community,
and hold a virtual meeting
&#183;       Members: mattcoop, tav, tropology, gerryg, sureshf, sdohrn
&#183;       Super-Ordinate Goal(s): stimulating collaboration amongst related
projects
&#183;       Sub-Ordinate Goals(s): getting you to attend our meeting, etc.

Details on the technology specifications, the roadmap as well as the
mapping process can be found at:
