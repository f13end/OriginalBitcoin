<PRE>Hi Kevin,

I must admit that I'm partly on the progressive side here.

A minimal amount of regulation, that takes into account the issue of cost,
is in my view necessary.

For example, in the no-trust country where I live, you cannot rely on
self-declared organic nor on self-regulation of financially interested
parties; only a form of regulation that involves different stakeholders, and
perhaps checked by some public authority, would do the trick ...

Unless you live in a village where you know everyone, and you fully trust
the word of your supplier, could you rely on absolutely non-regulated
production, in my view,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's an excellent article.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that, contrary to the fears of those on the &quot;progressive&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> left who support the local food movement, genuine &quot;free market
</I>&gt;<i> ideologues&quot; (in the sense of those who want to remove all forms of
</I>&gt;<i> subsidy and regulatory restraint on competition from the marketplace)
</I>&gt;<i> are the worst enemies of globalization.  Globalization isn't some
</I>&gt;<i> autonomous force that has to be restrained by the regulatory state.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a state construct that depends on continuing state subsidy and
</I>&gt;<i> regulation for its survival.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Guthman's portrayal of the dispute as one of regulatory restaint on
</I>&gt;<i> globalization vs. a greenwashed, yuppified, &quot;one meal at a time&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> approach is an utter strawman.  The problem is that the present
</I>&gt;<i> structural position of globalized agribusiness results from the
</I>&gt;<i> presence of the state, not its absence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our only alternatives aren't a regulatory state and a &quot;culture of
</I>&gt;<i> audit.&quot;  There is the third alternative of REMOVING the present
</I>&gt;<i> regulatory and subsidy regime's active supports to globalization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't need the regulatory powers of nation-states to prevent the
</I>&gt;<i> globalization of food.  We need nation-states to STOP criminalizing
</I>&gt;<i> free commercial speech--e.g., restrictions on labeling food as
</I>&gt;<i> GMO-free, food libel laws, etc.  We need nation-states to STOP
</I>&gt;<i> stealing land from peasants and turning it over to local landed elites
</I>&gt;<i> for use in cash-crop plantation agriculture in collusion with global
</I>&gt;<i> agribusiness interests (that applies, especially, to the U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> government and its fraternal aid over the last sixty years to make
</I>&gt;<i> Latin America safe for Latifundia and Guatemala safe for United
</I>&gt;<i> Fruit).  We need nation-states to STOP subsidizing long-distance
</I>&gt;<i> transportation.  We need nation-states to STOP subsidizing irrigation
</I>&gt;<i> water to large plantations.  We need nation-states to STOP enforcing
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;intellectual  property&quot; [sic] rights of Monsanto and its ilk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Progressives' friendliness toward state-mandated organic certification
</I>&gt;<i> is especially problematic.  The cost of certification is a significant
</I>&gt;<i> addition to overhead cost for a small market gardener, which acts as a
</I>&gt;<i> barrier toward the smallest producers marketing their surplus as
</I>&gt;<i> organic as a supplemental source of income in addition to some other
</I>&gt;<i> wage job.  Like all other forms of mandated minimum overhead costs, it
</I>&gt;<i> effectively criminalizes small-batch production and requires all
</I>&gt;<i> market actors to operate on some minimum scale in order to make a
</I>&gt;<i> profit (&quot;get big or get out&quot;).  The price premium on certified organic
</I>&gt;<i> vs. &quot;no-spray&quot; in my local natural food co-op, which amounts to about
</I>&gt;<i> 50%, is instructive.  I have pushed them repeatedly to choose no-spray
</I>&gt;<i> over certified whenever possible, and to make it clear to customers
</I>&gt;<i> with a wink and a nudge that it's really the same thing without the
</I>&gt;<i> added tribute to the certification cartel, but their yuppie liberal
</I>&gt;<i> regulation=&quot;progressive&quot; mindset seems to filter out the logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the main dangers (related to warnings by Paul Fernhout and P.M.
</I>&gt;<i>  Lawrence on this list) is that local government will use
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;progressives&quot; as useful idiots to relegate local, organic food to a
</I>&gt;<i> yuppie ghetto, through regulatory interventions (motivated by &quot;food
</I>&gt;<i> safety,&quot; of course) that impose unnecessary additional overhead costs
</I>&gt;<i> on small producers.  Unfortunately, all too many self-described
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;progressives&quot; will only see that it's a regulation and that it's
</I>&gt;<i> promoted as a &quot;public safety&quot; measure, and conclude--immovably--that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone against it must be one of those awful money-grubbing &quot;free
</I>&gt;<i> market ideologues&quot; who want to turn the world over to Halliburton and
</I>&gt;<i> club baby whales to death with baby seals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our main countereconomic hope is to seize the advantage of Peak Oil
</I>&gt;<i> and mushrooming transportation costs and encourage the expansion of
</I>&gt;<i> local small-scale production as fast as humanly feasible, so that the
</I>&gt;<i> growth of small-scale production under the radar of the existing
</I>&gt;<i> regulatory authorities is beyond their present power to monitor, and
</I>&gt;<i> any attempt to propose expanded monitoring capabilities will be met
</I>&gt;<i> with an existing situation on the ground.  Given such a momentum and
</I>&gt;<i> fait accompli, any ostensibly &quot;progressive&quot; proposals to cripple
</I>&gt;<i> small-scale local agriculture can be attacked as a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;radical&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to take away the main source people are currently relying on,
</I>&gt;<i> and to force them to go back to queuing up to buy the limited amount
</I>&gt;<i> of rationed corporate produce from California that still gets through
</I>&gt;<i> with diesel fuel costing $12/gal.  This gets back to the
</I>&gt;<i> defensive-offensive arms race which PML and I were discussing--make
</I>&gt;<i> hay while the sun shines!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the issue of &quot;elitism&quot; (namely, the present high cost of
</I>&gt;<i> local food and its predominant appeal to yuppies), that high cost
</I>&gt;<i> results to a large extent from the fact that the market has been
</I>&gt;<i> skewed so heavily by government subsidies toward large-scale
</I>&gt;<i> agribusiness shipping stuff cross-country or internationally.  The
</I>&gt;<i> cost premium also reflects a temporary producer rent, as demand
</I>&gt;<i> continues to outstrip supply, that will be remedied as local market
</I>&gt;<i> gardeners respond to the price signal by bringing new land under
</I>&gt;<i> cultivation.  And it reflects a distribution system geared toward
</I>&gt;<i> corporate agribusiness; demand is not yet high enough, in most areas,
</I>&gt;<i> for an entire truckload to be taken up by an organic farm's shipment
</I>&gt;<i> to a particular grocer, so it must split the load up between several
</I>&gt;<i> separated destinations.  When the artificial encouragement of
</I>&gt;<i> plantation agriculture is removed, and the balance shifts back to
</I>&gt;<i> local market gardens as the primary source of supply, the price of
</I>&gt;<i> local stuff will come down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to industrial agriculture's superior  &quot;productivity,&quot; it is more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient only in direct labor hours at the point of production, and
</I>&gt;<i> actually less efficient in output per acre.  And I would maintain
</I>&gt;<i> that, in many if not most cases, the superior labor efficiency at the
</I>&gt;<i> point of prodution is more than offset by distribution costs and
</I>&gt;<i> oligopoly markup.
