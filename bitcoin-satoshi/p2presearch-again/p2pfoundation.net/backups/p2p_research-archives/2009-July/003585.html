<PRE>Hi Matt,

thanks for this,

one quibble: you associate polytheism with democracy, and monotheism with
the divine rights of kings, but there's another way to read this:
monotheistic religions also aimed to limit the absolute powers of king, to
subsume them to a higher spiritual order and community, i.e. the
church/ummah etc... Of course non-monotheistic religions such as Buddhism
aimed at the same effect, so what I'm saying is that your linkage may not be
direct,

Michel

&gt;<i>  One of life's lessons is that those in charge are the ones who write the
</I>&gt;<i> rules. Usually this just means that might makes right and the powerful set
</I>&gt;<i> the standards. Often to their own benefit. On a more fundamental level
</I>&gt;<i> though, it means the opposite. Those who figure out what the rules are, set
</I>&gt;<i> the standards by which society functions. Rather than spend my life trying
</I>&gt;<i> win according to rules which often seem incomprehensible, contradictory and
</I>&gt;<i> tilted towards those already possessing advantages, I set out to figure what
</I>&gt;<i> really is going on. I did not seek answers to give me comfort, but truths to
</I>&gt;<i> which I must answer. The following essay revolves around three
</I>&gt;<i> interconnected observations about physical reality, spirituality and
</I>&gt;<i> economics. It is not about how to win, because in life the finish line is
</I>&gt;<i> death. It is simply about understanding how life works and how it might work
</I>&gt;<i> better. The conceptual foundation is the cycle of expansion and contraction
</I>&gt;<i> and the infinite number of interactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In trying to make sense of life, there is a constant tension between moving
</I>&gt;<i> forward and reviewing the past. We neither want to be stuck in the past, or
</I>&gt;<i> miss any lessons it might have to teach us. There is no one guide to the
</I>&gt;<i> future, so it is a constant process of adaptation. Often the corrections are
</I>&gt;<i> so natural, we make them subconsciously, while other times they are the
</I>&gt;<i> source of endless agonizing. The larger society goes through this process
</I>&gt;<i> and political coalitions form to advocate for various propensities, such as
</I>&gt;<i> conservatism looking to the presumed order of the past, or liberalism
</I>&gt;<i> leaning to the formless energy of the future. That cycle of social expansion
</I>&gt;<i> and civil consolidation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is time itself? Is it a narrative path along which we travel from the
</I>&gt;<i> past to the future? That is the common assumption on which thought,
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge and the concept of history is based. It is Newton's absolute flow
</I>&gt;<i> of time and Einstein's relative fourth dimension. There is a problem though.
</I>&gt;<i> The past is a generally agreed upon series of events, while the future is an
</I>&gt;<i> infinite number of possibilities, fanning out from the present. According to
</I>&gt;<i> Relativity there is no absolute measure of time and since Quantum Mechanics
</I>&gt;<i> says circumstance is not entirely deterministic, many physicists propose
</I>&gt;<i> that multiple realities emerge whenever the laws governing the progression
</I>&gt;<i> of events are not deterministic. Schrodinger's Cat is both dead and alive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is nature really this inefficient? What if some basic logical error exists
</I>&gt;<i> in our thinking? There are natives of South America who think of the past as
</I>&gt;<i> being in front of and the future behind the observer. That is because their
</I>&gt;<i> frame is the event, not the observer. Something happens, is observed and
</I>&gt;<i> then is past. We, on the other hand, are a few degrees removed from this
</I>&gt;<i> basic reality. For us, time is that series of events recorded in our minds
</I>&gt;<i> and history books, so the future is in front of us and the past is behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider that if two physical entities collide, it creates an event. While
</I>&gt;<i> the material proceeds from past events to future ones, those events go the
</I>&gt;<i> other way, from being in the future to being past. What is the real
</I>&gt;<i> direction of time? Are we traveling this path from the past into the future,
</I>&gt;<i> or does the activity of what is present create a series of events which go
</I>&gt;<i> from being future potential to past circumstance? Does the earth travel the
</I>&gt;<i> fourth dimension from yesterday to tomorrow, or does tomorrow become
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday because the earth rotates? Is time really the basis of motion, or
</I>&gt;<i> simply an effect of it? If it is an effect, than time has more in common
</I>&gt;<i> with temperature, than space. Energy creates and replaces events. Time is
</I>&gt;<i> the measurement, not what is being measured and that is why it is relative
</I>&gt;<i> to the circumstances of the measurement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no such thing as a dimensionless point in time, as that would
</I>&gt;<i> require a cessation of the very motion being measured. Such a state would
</I>&gt;<i> have a temperature of absolute zero. The reason light is described as
</I>&gt;<i> timeless is because it has no internal motion, since that would have to
</I>&gt;<i> exceed the speed of light in order to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The past is information. The future is where the energy goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reality is composed of energy manifesting structure and information. While
</I>&gt;<i> the energy is neither created or destroyed, its constant activity is
</I>&gt;<i> creating and consuming the information. The timeline of energy is from past
</I>&gt;<i> events to future ones, while the timeline for information and structure,
</I>&gt;<i> being created and consumed, is from future possibility to past circumstance.
</I>&gt;<i> While this structure is constantly evolving, it does so at varying rates, so
</I>&gt;<i> that change can be rapid or slow. As long as structures can absorb as much
</I>&gt;<i> or more energy as they lose, they continue to exist, but this requires
</I>&gt;<i> adapting to the information which the consumed energy manifests, whether it
</I>&gt;<i> is an organism eating food, or an institution adjusting to changes in the
</I>&gt;<i> larger culture. As institutions become more powerful, they tend to become
</I>&gt;<i> less adaptive and insular, while provoking external reaction. As long as
</I>&gt;<i> structures grow and adapt, the future is an evolving continuation of the
</I>&gt;<i> past. When they can no longer adapt, the future becomes a reaction to the
</I>&gt;<i> past. Evolution and revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While our brains are of the physical reality that goes from past to future,
</I>&gt;<i> our minds are the record of events which scroll away into the past.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually though, our lives are units of time that begin in the future and
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately recede into the past, as the larger process of life moves onto
</I>&gt;<i> the next generation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This dichotomy is analogous to the top down order, vs. bottom up process of
</I>&gt;<i> Complexity Theory. Order is the linear information receding into the past,
</I>&gt;<i> while process is the non-linear energy expanding into the future. As with
</I>&gt;<i> cosmology, where the gravitational structure of matter is contracting, while
</I>&gt;<i> the various forms of energy expand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Space, on the other hand, isn't simply three dimensions. Dimensions are
</I>&gt;<i> really just linear projections. Lines. Three dimensions are simply the
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate system of the center point. While relativity tried to model time
</I>&gt;<i> as an additional dimension, based on the narrative series, it did succeed in
</I>&gt;<i> showing that space cannot be considered an absolute three dimensional grid,
</I>&gt;<i> as the perspective is distorted from one point of reference to another. This
</I>&gt;<i> is evident in basic political terms, since everyone has their own view of
</I>&gt;<i> reality and they often clash, yet both points of view are serially coherent.
</I>&gt;<i> You could say the Arabs and Israelis use different coordinate systems to
</I>&gt;<i> define the same space. There is no universal perspective, as the more
</I>&gt;<i> universal a concept, perspective, or point of reference is, the more
</I>&gt;<i> generalized and inconsequential it is to any particular situation. It's the
</I>&gt;<i> infinite dimensionality which makes life dynamic, since there is no ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> pattern into which it can settle. The mind feeds on chaos and turns it into
</I>&gt;<i> order. Without that constant stimulation, it stagnates. Then again the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite effect is that if we cannot discern order in the chaos, we would
</I>&gt;<i> fall to pieces, intellectually and emotionally. That's why we constantly
</I>&gt;<i> make up stories and other explanations to piece together what we do not
</I>&gt;<i> understand, rather than just accept that we do not understand. We have to
</I>&gt;<i> move forward, or we will fall apart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you have large numbers of points moving about, the one concept which
</I>&gt;<i> does define the overall situation is temperature. The scalar level of
</I>&gt;<i> activity. In fact the same logic which uses the speed of light to say time
</I>&gt;<i> is a fourth dimension of space, could use a given amount of energy to say
</I>&gt;<i> temperature is an additional parameter of volume, since a change in the
</I>&gt;<i> volume of this energy would have a proportional effect on its temperature.
</I>&gt;<i> Volume and dimension are the scalar and vector of the vacuum, while
</I>&gt;<i> temperature and time are the scalar and vector of the fluctuation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So time and temperature are actually quite similar, as emergent effects of
</I>&gt;<i> motion. They describe the conceptual dichotomy of narrative and the larger
</I>&gt;<i> network of activity from which we distill the narrative. This relationship
</I>&gt;<i> between temperature and time manifests in the two halves of the brain, with
</I>&gt;<i> the parallel processor of the right brain functioning as a thermostat, that
</I>&gt;<i> perceives the multiplicity of the present moment, while the serial processor
</I>&gt;<i> of the left side records the linear cause and effect of time, from which
</I>&gt;<i> rationality emerges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Physics is trying to solve a problem arising from our intellectual distance
</I>&gt;<i> from reality, not a problem with reality. Other disciplines, such as
</I>&gt;<i> biology, neurology, computer sciences, etc. are working around this
</I>&gt;<i> conundrum in their own fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since thinking is conceptual reductionism, we tend to be focused on the
</I>&gt;<i> contrasts, rather than the connected medium. With morality, this is the
</I>&gt;<i> conflict between good and bad. The popular assumption is of a conflict
</I>&gt;<i> between two extremes, but the attraction to the beneficial and repulsion of
</I>&gt;<i> the detrimental is the primordial biological binary code, of which we are
</I>&gt;<i> complex manifestations. It evolves from the bottom up, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> proscribed from the top down. What is good for the fox, is bad for the
</I>&gt;<i> chicken, yet there is no clear point where the chicken ends and the fox
</I>&gt;<i> begins. Life is a bootstrapping process of creation and consumption, just as
</I>&gt;<i> time needs to consume information in order to create new information.
</I>&gt;<i> Success is being the foundation of what comes next, while failure is being
</I>&gt;<i> fodder for it. Both are necessary and all are part of the larger organic
</I>&gt;<i> process. While we like clear and easy answers, rather than hard and painful
</I>&gt;<i> truths, it should be remembered that between black and white are not just
</I>&gt;<i> shades of grey, but all the colors of the spectrum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We think of God as an all-knowing absolute, but the universal state of the
</I>&gt;<i> absolute has no division and therefore is both everything and nothing, while
</I>&gt;<i> anything not absolute is relative to everything else so defined. The
</I>&gt;<i> distinctions of knowledge are relativistic feedback loops of information and
</I>&gt;<i> judgment. It is a process, not an object. The essence of interpersonal
</I>&gt;<i> morality, to treat others as you would have them treat you, is moral
</I>&gt;<i> relativism. A spiritual absolute would be the raw essence of consciousness
</I>&gt;<i> from which complex organisms rise, not an all-knowing moral ideal from which
</I>&gt;<i> humanity fell. When society does prescribe moral absolutes, it is often
</I>&gt;<i> contradictory, since the linear presumption is that if a little is good,
</I>&gt;<i> than a lot must be much better and if anything is at all bad, than it must
</I>&gt;<i> be all bad. There is no conceptual regard for reciprocity, reaction,
</I>&gt;<i> balance, laws of unintended consequences, silver linings, etc. Ambiguity is
</I>&gt;<i> derided and people are expected to line up with the good and against the
</I>&gt;<i> bad. The result is endless chaos as masses of people are herded around
</I>&gt;<i> complex situations by simple minded assertions of good and bad. The irony is
</I>&gt;<i> that relativism provides a much more comprehensive moral code, since one's
</I>&gt;<i> actions are weighed against the rest of the universe, as opposed to whatever
</I>&gt;<i> definition of God you happen to abide by. Karma means that for every action,
</I>&gt;<i> there is an equal and opposite reaction. What goes around, comes around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Monotheism began as an idealization of social hierarchy and the wisdom of
</I>&gt;<i> elders, but it overlooks the more fundamental process by which society
</I>&gt;<i> regenerates this order, as each generation dies off and is replaced by the
</I>&gt;<i> next. The top down order is periodically replaced by bottom up processes.
</I>&gt;<i> Those higher up the evolutionary and social ladder are emergent layers of
</I>&gt;<i> evolution that depend on those below them, far more than those below depend
</I>&gt;<i> on those above. In fact, in nature, emergent levels tend to be predatory for
</I>&gt;<i> the purpose of controlling the growth of those they depend on, just as
</I>&gt;<i> emergent layers of society control those from which they rise. If they
</I>&gt;<i> succeed in destroying the health of those below them, then these higher
</I>&gt;<i> levels are no longer necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was polytheists who developed democracy, as tribes and cults interacted
</I>&gt;<i> and had to compromise, while monotheism gave us the divine right of kings.
</I>&gt;<i> It is necessary to have a common set of goals and standards for any group to
</I>&gt;<i> coexist, but it is more effective to have one built on a sensible foundation
</I>&gt;<i> of common goals, than one chasing after abstract ideals. That is because the
</I>&gt;<i> perfect is often the enemy of the good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Polytheism weaves a tapestry out of individual threads, while monotheism
</I>&gt;<i> braids a rope out of individual strands. Each have a purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even though our religions remain monotheistic, our political institutions
</I>&gt;<i> are largely democratic because they need the ability to regenerate from the
</I>&gt;<i> bottom up, as old ways and leaders get stagnant and rigid. Now our social
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies are not so much a matter of political power, but economic
</I>&gt;<i> weight, as wealth accumulates to those most adept at controlling the flow of
</I>&gt;<i> it. It is becoming increasingly obvious this situation is both unstable and
</I>&gt;<i> destructive to both society and the environment. The question is how to
</I>&gt;<i> institute a system which combines healthy bottom up growth, with effective
</I>&gt;<i> top down leadership and the ability to adjust both to changing
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances. The old system of adolescent greed and fear, constrained by
</I>&gt;<i> government regulation and protection, becomes less effective as the level of
</I>&gt;<i> economic and social complexity increases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A potential solution might lay in a reconsideration of money, that
</I>&gt;<i> institution of collective trust on which our mass society is based.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Money functions as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. These
</I>&gt;<i> work at cross purposes, because as a store of value it is a form of private
</I>&gt;<i> property, while as a medium of exchange it is a form of public utility,
</I>&gt;<i> similar to a road system. Most people focus on their own wealth in
</I>&gt;<i> comparison to others and thus think of it as private property. The reality
</I>&gt;<i> is that the system belongs to whomever guarantees its value. We do possess
</I>&gt;<i> the money we hold, in the same way we possess the section of road we are
</I>&gt;<i> driving on. You own your car, house, business, etc, but not the roads
</I>&gt;<i> connecting them. Money is a similar medium. It was one thing when money
</I>&gt;<i> signified some commodity you had stored or traded and its value was entirely
</I>&gt;<i> based on that underlaying commodity, but now the money supply far exceeds
</I>&gt;<i> the underlaying value of the real economy and so its value is maintained by
</I>&gt;<i> the ability of the government to support it through taxation. This means it
</I>&gt;<i> has become an illusionary bubble of value into which ever more resources are
</I>&gt;<i> needed to support and so is only functional as a medium of exchange. While
</I>&gt;<i> this is potentially catastrophic, it presents an opportunity to change the
</I>&gt;<i> basic economic equation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Believing money is private property encourages people to hoard it. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that capital is subject to the laws of supply and demand, with
</I>&gt;<i> the lender as supply and the borrower as demand. Since the supply of capital
</I>&gt;<i> must be balanced by demand for it, there must be sufficient borrowers for
</I>&gt;<i> this notational wealth, or its value will collapse. The problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> political power is on the side of those with money, rather than those
</I>&gt;<i> borrowing it and this lack of balance regularly creates situations which
</I>&gt;<i> swell the supply of money, while depleting the abilities of those borrowing
</I>&gt;<i> it. This results in periodic credit collapse, as masses of borrowers
</I>&gt;<i> default. We are at an extreme state of this particular situation, since the
</I>&gt;<i> government has borrowed massive amounts of its own money back, loan
</I>&gt;<i> standards were left in the dust and enormous bubbles of excess circulation
</I>&gt;<i> were blown up by the financial services industry to hold this surplus
</I>&gt;<i> notational wealth. Now that the bubble is collapsing and its value
</I>&gt;<i> evaporating, the powers that be are engaged in more destructive behavior by
</I>&gt;<i> issuing ever more debt and currency to keep the bubble from imploding. Since
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to prevent this additional money from being seriously
</I>&gt;<i> inflationary is to monetize ever more value out of society and the
</I>&gt;<i> environment in order to support and pay interest on it, to the increasing
</I>&gt;<i> detriment of world health. The situation is analogous to high blood
</I>&gt;<i> pressure. As bad debt clogs the arteries, increasing pressure doesn't clear
</I>&gt;<i> the clots, but damages healthy tissue and causes it to harden and burst in
</I>&gt;<i> weak points. When that happens, a person dies, but an economy flooded with
</I>&gt;<i> loose credit is distorted. In a Ponzi scheme, the money from later investors
</I>&gt;<i> is used to pay off earlier investors. When an asset bubble builds up, due to
</I>&gt;<i> easy credit, rather than improved earnings, the same thing happens, as later
</I>&gt;<i> investors pay earlier investors, then lose their investment when the well of
</I>&gt;<i> credulous investors dries up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paul Volcker is credited with curing inflation in the early 1980's, by
</I>&gt;<i> raising interest rates and reducing the flow of fresh credit into the
</I>&gt;<i> economy. While inflation may be caused by loose monetary policy, the effect
</I>&gt;<i> of higher rates is to reward those with money to lend, while punishing those
</I>&gt;<i> wishing to borrow it. So how did he cure an oversupply of money already in
</I>&gt;<i> the system, when his method of choice also significantly reduced demand for
</I>&gt;<i> it? The difference between the Federal Reserve selling debt it is holding
</I>&gt;<i> and the Treasury issuing fresh debt, is that while the Fed retires the money
</I>&gt;<i> it collects, the Treasury uses the money it gets to fund public spending.
</I>&gt;<i> Public spending doesn't compete with the private sector and generally funds
</I>&gt;<i> projects that enable increased private investment. So not only does this
</I>&gt;<i> deficit spending directly provide demand for credit, but has a multiplier
</I>&gt;<i> effect in the private sector, by increasing both its size and profitability.
</I>&gt;<i> Suffice to say, the rapidly increasing deficits of the early 1980's had a
</I>&gt;<i> significant effect on bringing the supply of credit in line with demand for
</I>&gt;<i> it. The reason a surplus of money increases the expense of borrowing it is
</I>&gt;<i> because the tendency is to spend it, rather than lend it, so there is
</I>&gt;<i> actually a shortage of money to borrow and the cost goes up. At the time,
</I>&gt;<i> economists were concerned that increased government deficits would further
</I>&gt;<i> raise interest rates for the private sector, but the opposite happened and
</I>&gt;<i> rates came down. The supply of money is potentially infinite. The issue is
</I>&gt;<i> keeping it in line with demand, so that its value is stable and people are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to lend it at nominal interest rates. Or spend it chasing asset
</I>&gt;<i> values upward, which is often just another form of inflation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Government debt is in fact one of the primary sources of demand for
</I>&gt;<i> capital. Just think for a moment where all the money that all the
</I>&gt;<i> governments of the world borrow would be invested otherwise? The stock
</I>&gt;<i> market? Real estate? Derivatives? Emerging markets? Now that the economy is
</I>&gt;<i> distressed and many are buying government debt as a safe investment, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than houses or pets.com, this public debt has become the biggest bubble of
</I>&gt;<i> all. Will it pop, like the dot com and housing bubbles? Can the government
</I>&gt;<i> pay it back? Well, that depends on how its tax receipts do. Need I say more?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider how it would change public perception of monetary wealth, if we
</I>&gt;<i> were to come to the realization that the monetary system really is now
</I>&gt;<i> entirely a form of public commons? The practice of hoarding excessive
</I>&gt;<i> amounts would lack logical justification, so savings would be taxed
</I>&gt;<i> progressively. This is not to discourage individual effort, but a necessary
</I>&gt;<i> recognition of the effect of excess savings on a functioning monetary
</I>&gt;<i> system. Too much of a good thing isn't always good. If people understood
</I>&gt;<i> monetary value constituted public property, than they would be far more
</I>&gt;<i> reluctant to drain value out of their social networks and environment to put
</I>&gt;<i> in a bank in the first place. We all like having roads, but there is little
</I>&gt;<i> inclination to pave more than we need. In this situation, the same would
</I>&gt;<i> apply to monetizing our lives. Other avenues of trust and reciprocation
</I>&gt;<i> would have the space to develop, which would strengthen communities and
</I>&gt;<i> their relationship to the environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Political power started as private initiative and eventually grew into
</I>&gt;<i> monarchy. Monarchists railed against mob rule, but we eventually learned how
</I>&gt;<i> to make it a public trust by allocating power where it was most responsive.
</I>&gt;<i> Why not do the same with the banking industry? As the currency is a public
</I>&gt;<i> utility, so profits from its administration could be public income. A public
</I>&gt;<i> banking system would not be one huge behemoth, but consist of institutions
</I>&gt;<i> incorporated at every level of governance, so that individuals could bank
</I>&gt;<i> with the ones which funded the services they are most likely to use.
</I>&gt;<i> Different communities would seek to provide the best services with these
</I>&gt;<i> funds, otherwise they would lose business and citizens to other communities.
</I>&gt;<i> As it is, banking doesn't need the inventiveness for which private
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise is most suited, but the stability that is the strength of the
</I>&gt;<i> public sector. Those running this financial system seem to think they have
</I>&gt;<i> the right to drain off as much as they can, with other business leaders
</I>&gt;<i> feeling the need to follow. What if the police, military, courts, etc. felt

</I>&gt;<i> The lack of extreme amounts of monetized wealth might also reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> potential for bloated regimes to develop. There will always be economic and
</I>&gt;<i> political convection cycles of rising influence and power, which eventually
</I>&gt;<i> cool off and settle back down after a few generations and in many ways that
</I>&gt;<i> is healthy and normal, but what we have now is an economic hurricane that is
</I>&gt;<i> sucking wealth out of the entire world as monetary abstraction has
</I>&gt;<i> metastasized into this enormous bubble of illusionary value. Given the state
</I>&gt;<i> of the world, it is a crisis we can't afford to waste.

</I>&gt;<i> The only unit which fully defines humanity and life is the earth. Possibly
</I>&gt;<i> humanity is the embryonic central nervous system of a planetary organism.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise we are just top predator of a collapsing ecosystem.
