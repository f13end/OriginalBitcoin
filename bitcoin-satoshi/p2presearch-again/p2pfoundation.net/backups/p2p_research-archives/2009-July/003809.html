<PRE>Thanks Paul,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Who is James Hogan?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> James P. Hogan is an author of hard science-fiction, as well as some
</I>&gt;<i> non-fiction. He is controversial about some topics. In general though, he
</I>&gt;<i> has a theme about abundance and self-reliance and peer networks in some of
</I>&gt;<i> his books, like &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot;. That specific book has a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer themes. He later said maybe he went too far with it, but in any
</I>&gt;<i> case, it is a picture of our current society in collission with a
</I>&gt;<i> post-scarcity peer-oriented society. If you have not read it, I can be
</I>&gt;<i> fairly sure you would enjoy it. The first third is a little slow as it sets
</I>&gt;<i> up our current social form but set onboard a vast spaceship; the conflict
</I>&gt;<i> starts after that when that spaceship arrives to bring order to the
</I>&gt;<i> post-scarcity society on another planet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The author's web site on the book:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.jamesphogan.com/books/book.php?titleID=29">http://www.jamesphogan.com/books/book.php?titleID=29</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An excerpt from Hogan's own summary:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.jamesphogan.com/books/info.php?titleID=29&amp;cmd=summary">http://www.jamesphogan.com/books/info.php?titleID=29&amp;cmd=summary</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  ... In the meantime, Earth went through a dodgy period, but managed in the
</I>&gt;<i> end to muddle through. The fun begins when a generation ship housing a
</I>&gt;<i> population of thousands arrives to &quot;reclaim&quot; the colony on behalf of the
</I>&gt;<i> repressive, authoritarian regime that emerged following the crisis period.
</I>&gt;<i> The Mayflower II brings with it all the tried and tested apparatus for
</I>&gt;<i> bringing a recalcitrant population to heel: authority, with its power
</I>&gt;<i> structure and symbolism, to impress; commercial institutions with the
</I>&gt;<i> promise of wealth and possessions, to tempt and ensnare; a religious
</I>&gt;<i> presence, to awe and instill duty and obedience; and if all else fails,
</I>&gt;<i> armed military force to compel. But what happens when these methods
</I>&gt;<i> encounter a population that has never been conditioned to respond?
</I>&gt;<i>  The book has an interesting corollary. Around about the mid eighties, I
</I>&gt;<i> received a letter notifying me that the story had been serialized in an
</I>&gt;<i> underground Polish s.f. magazine. They hadn't exactly &quot;stolen&quot; it, the
</I>&gt;<i> publishers explained, but had credited zlotys to an account in my name
</I>&gt;<i> there, so if I ever decided to take a holiday in Poland the expenses would
</I>&gt;<i> be covered (there was no exchange mechanism with Western currencies at that
</I>&gt;<i> time). Then the story started surfacing in other countries of Eastern
</I>&gt;<i> Europe, by all accounts to an enthusiastic reception. What they liked there,
</I>&gt;<i> apparently, was the updated &quot;Ghandiesque&quot; formula on how bring down an
</I>&gt;<i> oppressive regime when it's got all the guns. And a couple of years later,
</I>&gt;<i> they were all doing it!
</I>&gt;<i>  So I claim the credit. Forget all the tales you hear about the
</I>&gt;<i> contradictions of Marxist economics, truth getting past the Iron Curtain via
</I>&gt;<i> satellites and the Internet, Reagan's Star Wars program, and so on. ...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are not going to read it anytime soon, there is a plot summary with
</I>&gt;<i> big spoilers here:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_from_Yesteryear">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_from_Yesteryear</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a part of that which is not much of a spoiler:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  Since the availability of power from fusion reactors and cheap automated
</I>&gt;<i> labor has enabled them to develop a post-scarcity economy, they do not use
</I>&gt;<i> money as a means of exchange, nor do they recognize material possessions as
</I>&gt;<i> symbols of status. Instead, competence and talent are considered symbolic of
</I>&gt;<i> one's social standing &#8211; resources that cannot be counterfeited or hoarded,
</I>&gt;<i> and must be put to use if they are to be acknowledged. As a result, the
</I>&gt;<i> competitive drive that fuels capitalist financial systems has filled the
</I>&gt;<i> colony with the products of decades of incredible artistic and technical
</I>&gt;<i> talent, and there are no widespread hierarchies. No one person or group of
</I>&gt;<i> people can know everything, so no one person or group of people is expected
</I>&gt;<i> to speak for all. They have no centralized authorities; some would say they
</I>&gt;<i> have no government at all.
</I>&gt;<i>  The government of the Mayflower II utilizes various methods used
</I>&gt;<i> throughout human history in its attempts to exert control over the
</I>&gt;<i> Chironians; bureaucratic legislature, a capitalist financial system, and
</I>&gt;<i> proselytizing religion. However, they are frustrated by failure at every
</I>&gt;<i> turn: as a people that have never been exposed to Earth's coercive
</I>&gt;<i> authorities, the Chironians lack the social conditioning to even comprehend
</I>&gt;<i> the attempts at subversion. Soon many of the crew from the Mayflower II are
</I>&gt;<i> abandoning their increasingly futile positions in the invading hierarchy in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of adopting the more rewarding Chironian lifestyle. Amid widespread
</I>&gt;<i> speculation that a violent conflict will soon break out, some of the people
</I>&gt;<i> who arrived on the Mayflower II realize that the Chironians do not intend to
</I>&gt;<i> harm the majority of the ship's occupants, but rather use a form of
</I>&gt;<i> satyagraha (Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent noncompliance) to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate the peaceful travelers into their society and isolate the small
</I>&gt;<i> number who present a real threat. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
