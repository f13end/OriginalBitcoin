</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Growing your own food might be fun, but it&#8217;s not the best survival
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strategy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There&#8217;s a small but growing movement for locally-grown and even home-grown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> food in cities and suburbs. Some of the reasons behind this movement are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aesthetic &#8212; indeed, &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; buildings seen in recent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architectural proposals can be strikingly beautiful &#8212; ecological,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nutritional, recreational, and economic. Some of these reasons are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unimpeachable, as gardening can be an intellectually, psychologically, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> socially rewarding activity, but the economic arguments for it, which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually the basis for the promotion of the activity as a mass endeavor,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merit a closer analysis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Home gardening as a significant food source for consumption and barter has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been a regular fixture in many civilizations, and its resurgence,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the United States, seems to be tied to both the economic recession and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rising price of food. As the first trend has lowered wages, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application of personal time to growing food has come to appear a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> investment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, there&#8217;s a significant difference between growing food as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> substitute for less productive recreational activities, and growing food
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a substitute for time employed at work. In the latter case, it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unlikely that an amateur, small-scale operation can produce food more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cheaply, when all costs, specially time, have been properly accounted for,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a large-scale industrial operation. In any normal situation, working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra hour gives you the additional income to buy more or better foodstuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than you can grow in that hour.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What some proponents of local food production argue, though, is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conditions are straying from what has so far been considered normal. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular, they point towards the possibility of high energy costs and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deteriorated infrastructure pushing transportation costs to the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locally grown food will be economically competitive by virtue of its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proximity, as well as by the reduced benefit of energy-intensive physical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capital to agricultural productivity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the context of such an scenario (which we believe unlikely, although
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impossible if the transition to large-scale renewable energy fails), it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important to note that even in the absence of cheap energy, small-scale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agriculture has never been an economically efficient choice for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or societies. Most economic profits &#8212; and the best food &#8212; usually went to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who controlled large extents of fertile rural land, or energy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sources
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like mills (powered by the wind or a river) or large groups of slaves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Technology and society has, thankfully, changed since those times, but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic lessons learned along the way remain. In an hypothetical post-oil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dystopian future of very expensive energy and high transportation costs,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> growing food in a small garden will be less profitable, or in other terms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will lead to poorer nutrition, than owning a wind turbine or a dozen, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laboratory capable of producing antibiotics, or a network of solar-powered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> railroads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We enthusiastically support green cities, but not a retreat to an economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confined to the local scale. A complex, distributed, specialized economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> despite its larger requirements for coordination and management, immensely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more effective than any collection of isolated or semi-isolated households
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and small communities could be, and whatever challenges we will have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> face
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the coming decades, we stand a better chance with more resources at our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disposal, not less.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the 1980s, I volunteered on an organic farm, been a cashier at an
</I>&gt;<i> organic foods store, and was program administrator for NOFA-NJ's organic
</I>&gt;<i> farm certification program for a season. NOFA is Northeast Organic Farmer's
</I>&gt;<i> Association. My wife and I also wrote a simulation about gardening to help
</I>&gt;<i> people learn more about how to grow their own food locally in a sustainable
</I>&gt;<i> way. So, I've thought some about this issue. I've also long been an
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiast for local efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, the fact is, the argument above, that trade is more efficient than
</I>&gt;<i> doing everything yourself, is correct (up to a point).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The limitations of trade is that it encourages people to do big endeavors
</I>&gt;<i> that pass on external costs to others (like pollution from pesticide runoff
</I>&gt;<i> into groundwater, the cruelty suffered by animals in big factory farms, air
</I>&gt;<i> pollution costs of cross-country trucking of lettuce, and so on -- all
</I>&gt;<i> unaccounted for in the cheaper price). Organic originally was intended to
</I>&gt;<i> mean supporting local production; many early supporters are upset it can
</I>&gt;<i> apply to stuff trucked from one end of the country to the other when the
</I>&gt;<i> product can be grow locally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another external cost of society is the centralization of wealth in the
</I>&gt;<i> hands of a few large farm owners (including making it difficult for new
</I>&gt;<i> farmers to get started because land is so expensive).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem is the systematic risk introduced into the food supply by a
</I>&gt;<i> few monocultures dominating most production that may be susceptible to a
</I>&gt;<i> common disease or cause some common human health problem (like if
</I>&gt;<i> bioengineered with new genes in them from shellfish or whatever). Another
</I>&gt;<i> problem with conventional agriculture is it mines the soil and allows
</I>&gt;<i> erosion, and unlike China, in the USA, human waste is not returned to the
</I>&gt;<i> fields to replenish the soil (although rock dust could substitute perhaps).
</I>&gt;<i> Mainstream agriculture also puts on too much nitrogen fertilizer which
</I>&gt;<i> displaces micronutrients leading to weaker plants that are less healthy to
</I>&gt;<i> eat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These factors all create big risks to our society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most people accept that growing some grains like wheat in the Midwest is so
</I>&gt;<i> much easier than elsewhere that it makes a lot of sense to do that. But
</I>&gt;<i> vegetables and livestock are a very different story. They can be grown most
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere. So, in that sense, agriculture is way too over-centralized in the
</I>&gt;<i> USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Organic agriculture tends to be more labor and knowledge intensive, so it
</I>&gt;<i> costs more right now (until agricultural robots get better). But in any
</I>&gt;<i> case, we are talking about 2% of the labor pool versus (guessing) 4% if we
</I>&gt;<i> went all organic, so that is not much of an issue, considering how many
</I>&gt;<i> people want to farm but can't right now. In the long term, agricultural
</I>&gt;<i> robots that already exist from cow milkers to grape vine pruners (see below
</I>&gt;<i> links) will change how agriculture is done in the USA (and then globally),
</I>&gt;<i> removing a lot of the tedium of it and improving the quality of the results.
</I>&gt;<i> But, robotics assumes a significant industrial base (at least, right now; 3D
</I>&gt;<i> printing may change that some).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I never tire of referencing Manuel de Landa's comments about the need for
</I>&gt;<i> situation specific balances of top-down hierarchy and bottom-up meshworks in
</I>&gt;<i> coming up with working systems. It seems like here is another example.
</I>&gt;<i> Agriculture in the USA has tilted too far to the big farm hierarchy side,
</I>&gt;<i> pushing external costs like cancer and diabetes on to the public, and
</I>&gt;<i> centralizing control and profits in a few hands, and that should be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> How best to fix it, including by increasing peer production is an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting issue with lots of possibilities, some local like peer
</I>&gt;<i> production, and some global, like a basic income. So, it is not either-or.
</I>&gt;<i> We can, and will, have both network aspects and local aspects in a healthy
</I>&gt;<i> food system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Networks have their good points and their bad points. Our challenge, as a
</I>&gt;<i> society, is to get the most out of social networks while minimizing problems
</I>&gt;<i> they can cause. It's not easy. But for agriculture, where bad weather is
</I>&gt;<i> often a local phenomenon, networked agriculture may be important to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> local famines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there are a lot of reasons people like to garden that have nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> do with economics. It's exercise. It's fun. It's spiritual. It's
</I>&gt;<i> educational. It helps others. It's beautiful. And so on. So, just do it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope local manufacturing may go the same route as gardening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agriculture was about 90% of the workforce in the USA in 1800, 50% in 1900,
</I>&gt;<i> and 2% now. Manufacturing was 30% of the US workforce in 1950, and about 12%
</I>&gt;<i> now (plus some imports, but overall produces much more). The end of work is
</I>&gt;<i> upon us. The social and economic implications of that seem like a much
</I>&gt;<i> bigger problem long term (especially as long as the right to consume organic
</I>&gt;<i> food depends on having a job in a heavily automated economy that less and
</I>&gt;<i> less needs any sort of human labor).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in that sense, the original issue raised (have a job in a network or do
</I>&gt;<i> it yourself) is actually misleading. It may become, do it yourself if you
</I>&gt;<i> have the land and capital and knowledge vs. starve if you are not on welfare
</I>&gt;<i> (Marshall Brain's Manna book) vs. have some significant social change
</I>&gt;<i> towards a basic income or a gift economy (one blending local production and
</I>&gt;<i> network production).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it's hard to analyze these problems in isolation. As above,
</I>&gt;<i> robotics is changing the nature of agriculture in the USA. Were it not for
</I>&gt;<i> cheap illegal immigrants and other trends like women joining the workforce,
</I>&gt;<i> chances are we would have automated a lot more of agriculture decades ago.
</I>&gt;<i> (Many people, including me, wanted to work on agricultural robots but there
</I>&gt;<i> was no broad support for it.) Now that robots are getting so cheap and
</I>&gt;<i> effective, they are getting even cheaper than illegal immigrants or
</I>&gt;<i> desperate US Americans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some links to prove the point on robotics as happening now:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The Autonomous Grape-Vine Pruner&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://roboticnation.blogspot.com/2009/04/autonomous-grape-vine-pruner.html">http://roboticnation.blogspot.com/2009/04/autonomous-grape-vine-pruner.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A robot with a sophisticated vision system and sophisticated arms is able
</I>&gt;<i> to prune grape vines on a twig-by-twig basis.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a GPS driven tractor a village could share for plowing and
</I>&gt;<i> harvesting (although sharing equipment in agriculture is problematical since
</I>&gt;<i> usually everyone needs it at the same time for the same seasonal reasons):
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOXTHrU4RQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOXTHrU4RQ</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Discussed here:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.farmingrobot.com/">http://www.farmingrobot.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Farming Robot - with great news and information about the evolution of
</I>&gt;<i> farms to now include intelligent machines taking over much of the &quot;grunt
</I>&gt;<i> work&quot;. Don't believe us? Just have a look at our first of alternating
</I>&gt;<i> videos...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, robots allow other social arrangements. For example, dairy milking
</I>&gt;<i> robots have been around for a while, and they allow one family to
</I>&gt;<i> potentially run a large herd by themselves without as much early/late
</I>&gt;<i> scheduling for milking.
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;VMS robotic milking&quot; (There are other vendors of such systems; that's
</I>&gt;<i> just a great video.)

</I>&gt;<i> More on milking robot systems here:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.robotmatrix.org/agriculture-robot.htm">http://www.robotmatrix.org/agriculture-robot.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supposedly the cows like the robot milking better. They can get milked
</I>&gt;<i> whenever they want and the machinery is easier on the udders. Record keeping
</I>&gt;<i> is better too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a robot barn cleaner:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bphBIwv5Vp8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bphBIwv5Vp8</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those special purpose systems seem to be working well, but more general
</I>&gt;<i> purpose robots in the field are still under development, so there still
</I>&gt;<i> remains a lot to do in that area of agricultural robotics:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Field Robot Event 2008&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD25hc9SvBQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD25hc9SvBQ</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryYMMQLlYa0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryYMMQLlYa0</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, continually improving automation and new materials and new
</I>&gt;<i> designs (often resulting from collaboration through the internet) means a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of our economic and social assumptions will need to be revisited, and
</I>&gt;<i> not just in rural areas. But it is silly to make social policy on something
</I>&gt;<i> like agriculture without considering technological trends and even current
</I>&gt;<i> realities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those on Franz Nahrada's Global Villages blog, here is a related post I
