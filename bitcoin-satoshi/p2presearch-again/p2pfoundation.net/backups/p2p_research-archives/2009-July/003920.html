I agree that the present system will be abandoned under pressure of
necessity because it's unsustainable, and I hope at least that the
people running it will allow it to disintegrate as peacefully as did
the Soviet elite 20 years ago instead of making a catastrophic last
stand and launching civil war to defend it.

But as an a fortiori  argument that people (at least the people
running them) cling to bad systems, at the time the present system was
created over a century ago, it was not only not self-evidently the
most efficient way of doing things, it was far worse than the
available alternatives and was imposed on society by a top-down
revolution, mainly because the people who ran the system and benefited
from it saw it as natural.  The present elite are not only clinging to
a bad system as long as they can, they created a system that was bad
from the beginning, and reshaped an entire society to see it as
natural and inevitable.

And things like the DMCA and all the rest of the proprietary culture
regime are examples of their attempt to cling to it as long as they
can.  Of course I hope when they see the untenability of their
position, they'll collapse as quickly as did the Soviet elite.
Creating alternatives and doing everything possible to subvert and
demoralize those people is key.
