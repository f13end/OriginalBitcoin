<PRE>Hi Paul,

thanks so much for sharing this, so illuminating, and of course, some of
these things have happened to me as well ...  it's exhilirating to construct
the p2p-foundation, while being exhausting to bump against repeated
failures, especially in terms of providing a stable income for my family ...
I'm struggling to keep that dog away ...

Michel

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is also a very interesting story to cover for our blog, as it shows
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the proprietary approach has made the project of cradle to cradle
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> production
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fail,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;...the architect said, 'I want to be the Bill Gates of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sustainability,' and [that] he wants to make a royalty off of every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> green standard and every green product out there.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This just about floored me, because the vibe I'd been picking up from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the whole article was &quot;Bill Gates.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The technologies that save the world will be those that ordinary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people can adopt for themselves at low cost, without paying royalties
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to some greenwashed billionaire.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like an essential part of the article:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Green Guru Gone Wrong: William McDonough &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/1042475/print">http://www.fastcompany.com/node/1042475/print</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> For those who came to know McDonough from within the environmental and
</I>&gt;<i> design movements -- those whose labors rarely reach the ears of Laurie David
</I>&gt;<i> -- an alternative narrative exists about him. Until now, it has been
</I>&gt;<i> shielded from the mainstream for two reasons: First, McDonough has done more
</I>&gt;<i> than most to popularize the very idea of cleaning up the world, and for
</I>&gt;<i> that, even his detractors agree he deserves thanks; second, if word gets out
</I>&gt;<i> that he may not be all that he appears, the overall cause of sustainability
</I>&gt;<i> could suffer. &quot;He's been incredibly important and valuable in this role as
</I>&gt;<i> visionary,&quot; says Auden Schendler, executive director of sustainability at
</I>&gt;<i> Aspen Skiing Co. &quot;The problem is that sometimes the theorists like McDonough
</I>&gt;<i> will represent themselves as practitioners, and that's where the guys in the
</I>&gt;<i> trenches get frustrated.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also this:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> McDonough desperately needs to break the logjam that has stalled him. Just
</I>&gt;<i> as the global fixation on sustainability is exploding, McDonough's design
</I>&gt;<i> revolution is paralyzed -- and he is the paralyzing agent, unable to
</I>&gt;<i> capitalize on his brilliant, crucial idea, but unwilling to set it free.
</I>&gt;<i> Last year, Environmental Building News deemed McDonough's cradle-to-cradle
</I>&gt;<i> certification a &quot;black box&quot;: &quot;You can see what's going in and what's going
</I>&gt;<i> out, but you're not privy to exactly what's going on inside the process,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> says Nadav Malin, the trade journal's editor. In truth, among MBDC's 160
</I>&gt;<i> certifications, virtually the only consumer brands are the U.S. Postal
</I>&gt;<i> Service and Kiehl's -- the latter of which Brad Pitt helped push through as
</I>&gt;<i> a charity product for his foundation. Critics argue that McDonough's work is
</I>&gt;<i> not transparent or consensus based, and that because he sometimes consults
</I>&gt;<i> for companies whose products he's also certifying, the whole endeavor is
</I>&gt;<i> conflicted, if not unethical. &quot;All the money stays in one place,&quot; says Tim
</I>&gt;<i> Cole, director of environmental initiatives and product development at Forbo
</I>&gt;<i> Flooring, and treasurer of the USGBC. The impression that emerges, says
</I>&gt;<i> Cole, is, &quot; 'Hey, if you want your product certified cradle to cradle, just
</I>&gt;<i> go to McDonough, pay your price, and it will happen.' I think cradle to
</I>&gt;<i> cradle will either have to get better or become a thing of the past. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to evolve with the movement.&quot; McDonough is trying. His latest strategy
</I>&gt;<i> involves, once again, opening up the work to the public -- this time to
</I>&gt;<i> develop MBDC's materials database Wiki-style.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because I was involved with organic food certification in the 1980s, I can
</I>&gt;<i> see the value of certification in general, and know it can be done
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable ethically (though in theory there could in theory remain issues
</I>&gt;<i> with cosy boards made up of farmers certifying each other, though that is
</I>&gt;<i> not what I saw in practice). I've long thought, for example, one could apply
</I>&gt;<i> the certification idea to free and open source software in some way (people
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrating a knowledge of copyright issue to get certified as producing
</I>&gt;<i> stuff likely to be uncontaminated by proprietary stuff). I like the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> applying certification to manufactured goods. So, I like that aspect of
</I>&gt;<i> cradle-to-cradle whatever else one could say about who gets any profits from
</I>&gt;<i> certification (in practice, if done by a non-profit, these certification
</I>&gt;<i> processes may be run at just about cost with little profit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like there are at least two big failure modes in being an
</I>&gt;<i> activist, neither of which is either to avoid in a new area a long time
</I>&gt;<i> before it becomes mainstream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One failure mode is outlined here for William McDonough and relates to the
</I>&gt;<i> celebrity worshiping winner-take-all economic culture we have constructed
</I>&gt;<i> for ourselves. It is where you try so hard to push an idea, yet you still
</I>&gt;<i> need money for living expenses, that, in a quest for right livelihood, your
</I>&gt;<i> public persona becomes the idea and your finances become the idea. People
</I>&gt;<i> often like to be around celebrities, and when you become one in the process
</I>&gt;<i> of promoting an idea, it gets hard to put in lots of footnotes as to sources
</I>&gt;<i> in everything you say (even if you may start out wanting to and doing so).
</I>&gt;<i> And as you get your presentations down, and as the ideas become more of
</I>&gt;<i> yourself, the roots may fade away, maybe even to the point where you believe
</I>&gt;<i> in the originality of it all yourself. And if you are the kind of person
</I>&gt;<i> good at taking ideas and making them your own and presenting them in
</I>&gt;<i> innovative ways, and so on, chances are you are not a &quot;scholar&quot; to begin
</I>&gt;<i> with (with frequent footnotes, cautious pronouncements, careful caveats,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.). Part of the failure mode is that you may start to annoy everyone
</I>&gt;<i> whose work you build on, people who also would also like a bit of the
</I>&gt;<i> limelight (and the funding,  give the lack of a basic income), and you may
</I>&gt;<i> come to believe your own hype. This is the rock star failure mode. Another
</I>&gt;<i> aspect is over confidence (the New Yorker just had an essay about that and
</I>&gt;<i> financial markets and Bear Sterns, given appearing optimistic leads to more
</I>&gt;<i> support.) There is another aspect, too. You can see it in music too as well
</I>&gt;<i> as visual arts -- people just making more of the same that pays and then
</I>&gt;<i> burning out from boredom and fear of taking risks and seeming foolish
</I>&gt;<i> (including wanting to hide failures). Once people have been heavily rewarded
</I>&gt;<i> for doing one thing, it can be hard to go back to joyful roots and
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation including documenting failures (since most experiments will
</I>&gt;<i> be failures, being tolerant of failure is an important aspect of being a
</I>&gt;<i> researcher, something Hans Moravec has said). Bucky Fuller had aspects of
</I>&gt;<i> this rock star failure mode too (for example, the issue of who invented the
</I>&gt;<i> tensegrity idea), although he also made genuine contributions in his own
</I>&gt;<i> way. Nicholas Negroponte and the OLPC project suffered some of this too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there is an opposite failure mode (one I'm more enmeshed in myself. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> That is the one that leads to cynicism and inaction and pessimism and
</I>&gt;<i> focusing more on some minor aspect of infrastructure (or even wishful
</I>&gt;<i> thinking) than getting out a message in an effective way. Also, as the years
</I>&gt;<i> go by, you can become bitter and twisted and defensive as a person, having
</I>&gt;<i> fought one emotional and intellectual battle after another, until everything
</I>&gt;<i> is a conflict, everything is an assumed failure, every person is assumed to
</I>&gt;<i> be unsympathetic, which of course also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,
</I>&gt;<i> because who wants to hang out with bitter or timid or critical people. It's
</I>&gt;<i> also a sort of &quot;learned helplessness&quot; like Martin Seligman studied,
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness</A>
</I>&gt;<i> where for example, an experimenter shocks a dog every time it tries to walk
</I>&gt;<i> over part of a floor towards its food dish, and pretty soon the dog curls up
</I>&gt;<i> in a corner and stops trying to get across the floor even as it starves.
</I>&gt;<i> Even after the experimenter drags the dog across the floor to the food, the
</I>&gt;<i> dog remains dysfunctional. For me, after about twenty years of being
</I>&gt;<i> interested in a sustainable design system, but being at places where it was
</I>&gt;<i> of little interest (I tried to get a PhD related to it at four different
</I>&gt;<i> universities in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as start a related
</I>&gt;<i> business),
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/sunrise-sustainable-technology-ventures.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/sunrise-sustainable-technology-ventures.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/princeton-graduate-school-plans.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/princeton-graduate-school-plans.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and not having the talents or experiences or connections or interests or
</I>&gt;<i> starting capital or willingness to focus (or compromise) that William
</I>&gt;<i> McDonough had, I'm more in the second category, the hungry dog that won't go
</I>&gt;<i> over to the food dish that it is staring at. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These of course are exaggerations; real people, with real lives, and real
</I>&gt;<i> families, of course are more complicated than prototypical rock stars or
</I>&gt;<i> helpless starving dogs. All people have strengths and weaknesses, and there
</I>&gt;<i> are even situations where weaknesses become strengths, and strengths can
</I>&gt;<i> become weaknesses. :-) But there is still an element of truth to both
</I>&gt;<i> extremes as risks for any activist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, it's very heartening to see the people posting to the p2presearch list
</I>&gt;<i> or the open manufacturing list or many other places, people who may be more
</I>&gt;<i> new to these ideas, but who see them differently -- as stuff that is
</I>&gt;<i> happening now, but without the baggage of either having made a living off of
</I>&gt;<i> them for a decade or two, or *not* having made a living off of them for a
</I>&gt;<i> decade or two. :-) A new generation shows up with the same hope and
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasm and openness that William and I started out with, but I can still
</I>&gt;<i> hope more comes from it now in a global and open way. That article is
</I>&gt;<i> hopeful about these ideas as a movement, mentioning someone who &quot;knows more
</I>&gt;<i> than 100 sustainability executives&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And as I said about my overly ambitious graduate school plans: &quot;The good
</I>&gt;<i> news is that now, twenty years later, all or most of the hurdles have fallen
</I>&gt;<i> that otherwise needed leaping before being able to comprehensively design
</I>&gt;<i> self-replicating space habitats, and all the computer and informational
</I>&gt;<i> resources I thought I needed then are now available for cheap or free. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, for only a few thousand dollars, I have the equivalent of an early
</I>&gt;<i> 1990s supercomputer in my office with terabytes of storage and a high speed
</I>&gt;<i> color scanner and a network connection and access to Google and Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> and so on. So, what I outlined in the 20th century is more and more doable
</I>&gt;<i> in the 21st century for less and less cost. So, item 13 (the major goal
</I>&gt;<i> [self-replicating and self-reliant habitats]) is now approachable without
</I>&gt;<i> needing to do much on the other prerequisite items listed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, my own complaint about the copyright and secrecy issue is that
</I>&gt;<i> Appropedia (which I am not affiliate with, but is similar to my OSCOMAK
</I>&gt;<i> project in some ways), did not win the first Buckminster Fuller challenge
</I>&gt;<i> when William McDonough was one of the judges. Was there a sense that an
</I>&gt;<i> excellent free project like Appropedia would compete with his business?
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia">http://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://challenge.bfi.org/application_summary/149">http://challenge.bfi.org/application_summary/149</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://challenge.bfi.org/jurors">http://challenge.bfi.org/jurors</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OSCOMAK also did not get the prize the next year, either. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://challenge.bfi.org/application_summary/362#">http://challenge.bfi.org/application_summary/362#</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In both cases, specific projects were chosen for the challenge winner, not
</I>&gt;<i> general tools for helping anyone be a better designer. Of course, there
</I>&gt;<i> could be lots of reasons projects were not chosen (see my second failure
</I>&gt;<i> mode above. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, it is often the case that even non-profits, with boards made of people
</I>&gt;<i> successful in the current system, work against an open and abundant future
</I>&gt;<i> for all. For example:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The NED, NGOs and the Imperial Uses of Philanthropy: Why They Hate Our
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Hearts, Too&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.counterpunch.org/roelofs05132006.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/roelofs05132006.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> If the source is confusing, the message is usually clear: &quot;democratization&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> strives for civil rights and elections, but it also must include an open
</I>&gt;<i> door to foreign capital, labor contracts, resource extraction, and military
</I>&gt;<i> training. These networks also define &quot;civil society&quot; to include rock
</I>&gt;<i> concerts and street mobs, but not government-provided maternal health
</I>&gt;<i> clinics, child care, or senior services.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, there's the learned helplessness bitterness coming up again of my own
</I>&gt;<i> failure mode. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I still have a lot of sympathy and respect for the guy. He's a
</I>&gt;<i> human being trying to navigate a difficult transition from a competitive
</I>&gt;<i> capitalist economy to a post-scarcity globally abundant society while also
</I>&gt;<i> looking to his personal survival. It's not an easy situation for anybody to
</I>&gt;<i> be in. And everyone makes mistakes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People doing this sort of work openly as a hobby, or who do this work as a
</I>&gt;<i> retired person with a basic income from social security, or a person who has
</I>&gt;<i> inherited wealth, or one who has a working spouse who likes his or her job,
</I>&gt;<i> or one who works at a grant-funded non-profit or government agency or
</I>&gt;<i> university with support to work on sustainability issues, are on much safer
</I>&gt;<i> ground to avoid one of these two extremes. Although each of those comes with
</I>&gt;<i> baggage to:
</I>&gt;<i> * hobbyists often have limited time;
</I>&gt;<i> * retired people have less energy;
</I>&gt;<i> * inherited wealth usually comes with a world view and also guilt and
</I>&gt;<i> enmeshment in things-as-they-are;
</I>&gt;<i> * stay-at-home parents have other responsibilities or the spouse may not
</I>&gt;<i> like their job and complain about money issues;
</I>&gt;<i> * people in a university setting are ofter &quot;Disciplined Minds&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> * government agencies tend to hierarchical solutions that are politically
</I>&gt;<i> directed; and
</I>&gt;<i> * non-profits are sometimes more about getting grants (including changing
</I>&gt;<i> their programs to meet grantmakers criterion) than using the grants in an
</I>&gt;<i> innovative or risk-taking way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are no easy answers to this. But, still, bit by bit, we seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> crawling towards some better solutions. From Winston Churchill:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing...after they have
</I>&gt;<i> exhausted all other possibilities.&quot;
