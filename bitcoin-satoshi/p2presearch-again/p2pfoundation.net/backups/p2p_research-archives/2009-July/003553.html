Just the same graph as in Wikipedia with the curve shifted over a bit to the 
left and down to touch the X and Y axis.
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand</A>

OK, so I downloaded some free software (Inkscape) and made a new version of 
that, derived from the Wikipedia source. :-)

It is here:
   &quot;The Supply and Demand Curve, if demand is ultimately limited&quot;
   <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/Supply-and-demand-limited.svg">http://www.pdfernhout.net/Supply-and-demand-limited.svg</A>

Where the demand curve touches the Y axis is labeled &quot;Poverty&quot;, where the 
demand curve touches the X axis is labeled &quot;Demand Saturation&quot;, and where 
the supply curve flattens is labeled &quot;Abundance&quot; with a cornucopia spiral. I 
hope the SVG renders well for others, especially with the translucent sections?

One can move up the supply curve by increasing productivity, or, one can 
lower the demand curve to bring abundance at a lower level of productivity 
by voluntary simplicity.

Demand is only defined by economists as demand by people with money, so 
global abundance would require some sort of social equity process like a 
basic income, or widespread local charity, or widespread widely distributed 
ownership of local means of flexible production (like &quot;hyperproductive&quot; peer 
production or self-replicating 3D printers).

Here is the reason for choosing a spiral for abundance, related to a Native 
American tradition:
   <A HREF="http://www.marcinequenzer.com/creation.htm#The%20Field%20of%20Plenty">http://www.marcinequenzer.com/creation.htm#The%20Field%20of%20Plenty</A>
&quot;In our Seneca Tradition, the Field of Plenty is seen as a spiral that has 
its smallest revolution out in space and its' largest revolution near the 
Earth. This shape could be likened to an upside-down tornado. When our 
Ancestors assisted the Pilgrims in planting Corn and raising crops so they 
would not starve, we taught them the understanding of the Field of Plenty by 
bringing the cornucopia baskets full of vegetables. The Iroquois women wove 
these baskets as a physical reminder that Great Mystery provides through the 
Field of Plenty. The Pilgrims were taught that giving prayers of gratitude 
was not just a Christian concept. The Red Race understood thanksgiving on a 
daily basis. The Field of Plenty is always full of abundance.  The gratitude 
we show as Children of Earth allows the ideas within the Field of Plenty to 
manifest on the Good Red Road so we may enjoy these fruits in a physical 
manner. When the cornucopia was brought to the Pilgrims, the Iroquois People 
sought to assist these Boat People in destroying their fear of scarcity. The 
Native understanding is that there is always enough for everyone when 
abundance is shared and when gratitude is given back to the Original Source. 
The trick was to explain the concept of the Field of Plenty with few 
mutually understood words or signs. The misunderstanding that sprang from 
this lack of common language robbed those who came to Turtle Island of a 
beautiful teaching. Our &quot;land of the free, home of the brave&quot; has fallen 
into taking much more than is given back in gratitude by its citizens. 
Turtle Island has provided for the needs of millions who came from lands 
that were ruled by the greedy. In our present state of abundance, many of 
our inhabitants have forgotten that Thanksgiving is a daily way of living, 
not a holiday that comes once a year.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> Verzola, our in-house abundance expert:

That's very insightful, and much more concise and eloquent than my post. :-)

Now that you point it out, I can wonder if I saw it before and forgot about 
it, it is so similar in scope? So, maybe my comments on this topic are all 
inspired by Roberto's?
