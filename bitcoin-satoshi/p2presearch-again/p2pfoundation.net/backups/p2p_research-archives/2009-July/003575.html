</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Technologies of Flocking*, by  Jaap van Till, NL, version: July 4 2009.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;*Only from the heart can you touch the sky.&quot; Jalal ad-Din Rumi, Persian
</I>&gt;<i> Poet*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, they could not twitter Ahmadinejad out of his presidential palace, but
</I>&gt;<i> the Iranian netizens did surely demonstrate that the internet is mightier
</I>&gt;<i> than the pen, to paraphrase the famous 1839 sentence of Bulwer. A new and
</I>&gt;<i> wired middle class is waking up. There are now 34 million women in Iran, of
</I>&gt;<i> which more than 70 percent is below thirty years of age, who have shown on
</I>&gt;<i> the net that after 30 years of this regime that they no longer want to be
</I>&gt;<i> treated as objects. Out of respect for them it is interesting to take a
</I>&gt;<i> closer look at what is happening online and why. Some things have realy
</I>&gt;<i> changed irreversibly in Iran and the netizens there deserve a monument for
</I>&gt;<i> that ((see illustration)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the heavy use [1] of Twitter birdtweets (short messages) by Iranians and
</I>&gt;<i> ex-patriates showed how much social and political impact networking
</I>&gt;<i> technologies can have besides the commercial  and economic impact of
</I>&gt;<i> Internet technology we discuss on the Arch-Econ list of Gordon Cook.  Social
</I>&gt;<i> media is more than just a &quot;nifty&quot; thing now. Real people connected to real
</I>&gt;<i> people are changing the world. This short paper tries to give a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> perspective on (1) what civilians can do with net-tech during rebellions and
</I>&gt;<i> (2) how they organize themselves to empower themselves and eachother.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You surely will have noticed [2] from the post-election (June 12) protests
</I>&gt;<i> and turmoil in Iran that the combination of on the spot cell-phones and
</I>&gt;<i> photo's and films on the Web may in some instances be more effective than
</I>&gt;<i> kalashykovs and axes against demonstrators. This fast communication of short
</I>&gt;<i> group-messages is a handy way of sharing info  and synchronising actions and
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrations. At first the authorities had not noticed this social network
</I>&gt;<i> and thought that they had blocked the demonstrators by taking out part of
</I>&gt;<i> the internet and the sms traffic in Iran. The authorities tried to stop the
</I>&gt;<i> flow of information out of the country from cellnets and webpages in every
</I>&gt;<i> way they knew of. And still the images get through. It is not wise to tell
</I>&gt;<i> too much about how this is done but part of the parallel worldwide internet
</I>&gt;<i> paths are kept open by volunteers that installed proxies [3] faster that the
</I>&gt;<i> authorities could stifle them. The massive use of simple and powerful
</I>&gt;<i> technology in the hands of the people (aka ppl) turns out to be unstoppable.
</I>&gt;<i> As are the shouts of the slogan of the 1979 revolution from the rooftops at
</I>&gt;<i> night.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has been done before, and every time ppl have found another clever
</I>&gt;<i> tele-communication system to co-laborate p2p and to bypass government
</I>&gt;<i> info-blockades to the outside world.Information technology changes the
</I>&gt;<i> balance of power between civilians and rulers. Each time they surprised and
</I>&gt;<i> baffled the authorities by audace and unstoppable technology. Some examples:
</I>&gt;<i> (the net tech shown was often used in combination with other tele-tools and
</I>&gt;<i> many other old fashioned and proven mouth-to-mouth links are present
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere)
</I>&gt;<i> a. The Pirate Bay movement and political party in Sweden: blogs from the
</I>&gt;<i> courtroom and a clear rebel messages.
</I>&gt;<i> b. Blogs from disaster sites by those present being better informed and
</I>&gt;<i> faster than the media reporters.
</I>&gt;<i> c. Belgrade, Internet Radio relayed from Amsterdam.
</I>&gt;<i> d. Gdansk Solidarnost: Walky-Talky radio links and donated faxmachines.
</I>&gt;<i> e. Vilnius: FidoNet dial-up email linked bulletin boards + international
</I>&gt;<i> links and CNN Satcom.
</I>&gt;<i> f. Mexico Zapatistas: Citizens Band radios
</I>&gt;<i> g. Moskow countercoup against Gorbachev was defused by the NREN networks
</I>&gt;<i> h. Bucharest : the TV &amp; communication tower was constructed to be
</I>&gt;<i> defendable but the rebels where inside.
</I>&gt;<i> i. The present Iranian clergy rulers overthrew the Sjah regime in 1979 by
</I>&gt;<i> .....audio tape distribution.  Every week the Ajatollah Khomeini in Paris
</I>&gt;<i> recorded a sermon which was
</I>&gt;<i>    smuggled to Iran on a audiotape with for instance Elvis on the cover.
</I>&gt;<i> Then these tapes where copied and copied and copied until every mosque tower
</I>&gt;<i> in the country
</I>&gt;<i>    could sound it on the loudspeakers for all in the country to hear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What are the recurring patterns from all these uprising cases*.
</I>&gt;<i> As a scientist I do not automaticaly sympathise with every protestor or all
</I>&gt;<i> these movements described,  but what appears is: massive unstoppable free
</I>&gt;<i> flow of relevant messages that show reality by and between those present and
</I>&gt;<i> bypass the authorities and invalidate the official broadcasted version of
</I>&gt;<i> what ppl are supposed to see and think. The central officials are often
</I>&gt;<i> faced with a dilemma with openness and would rather isolate the rebels: to
</I>&gt;<i> block communication channels would harm the publicity, command &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> control links of the state too and would harm education and economy. So what
</I>&gt;<i> is happening that can make a few thousands of twittering young boys and
</I>&gt;<i> girls in Tehran so important?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long before Internet, ICT and telecommunications started be be in such a
</I>&gt;<i> vital infrastructural position, the visionary Ted Nelson already described
</I>&gt;<i> [4] the liberating effects personal computing and messaging would have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> j. In the early 2000's young volunteers of the Open Society Institute [5]
</I>&gt;<i> helped to establish new economic, social and cultural lifeflows in the
</I>&gt;<i> former USSR countries with the help of computers and networking. George
</I>&gt;<i> Soros, its maecenas, was certainly conscious of the powerfull role of young
</I>&gt;<i> professionals using linked PC's can play for a post dictatorship open
</I>&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *So what happens during the use of these powertools*.
</I>&gt;<i> Recently Clay Shirky explained very clearly the shift in communication
</I>&gt;<i> patterns from 'central' to 'lateral' in a spectacular recent speech [5] on
</I>&gt;<i> TED, as far as I know before the recent turmoil in Iran, and he did see this
</I>&gt;<i> trend coming in his book [6]. While the established view of many
</I>&gt;<i> people about Internet is that is a new *vertical broadcasting to the ppl* (I) medium
</I>&gt;<i> for PR, news, high attention celeb gossip and commerce; side by sides with
</I>&gt;<i> classical *one-way* distributionchannels advertisements, newspapers and
</I>&gt;<i> TV; a much more signficant role is discoverded by two-way vertical dialogues
</I>&gt;<i> (II) of authorities and companies with citizens, clients. Not a bad idea to
</I>&gt;<i> talk to your subordinates, what?! A famous demo of the power of dialogue was
</I>&gt;<i> the sudden shouting back from the audience gathered to hear yet another
</I>&gt;<i> lenghty monologue from Ceausescu on December 21 1989. He was baffled. What
</I>&gt;<i> now in 2009 takes and took many by surprise is that a third form of
</I>&gt;<i> communication: horizontal/lateral collaboration (III) between ppl is a much
</I>&gt;<i> more potent stuff. The essential change from I and II is that now the
</I>&gt;<i> communication is not only between controlaholic rulers and individual
</I>&gt;<i> citizens but the latter organize themselves ad-hoc into close knit
</I>&gt;<i> groups/teams which we can call &quot;flocks&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> k. The Obama pre-election campaign heavily used telecom and internet for I,
</I>&gt;<i> and II,  but exploded with bottom-up success in III &quot;grass roots Community
</I>&gt;<i> Action&quot;. This campaign surprised many with the power it had of mobilisation
</I>&gt;<i> of voters and end-user innovations. Obama did not only talk *to* the ppl
</I>&gt;<i> and *with* the ppl but they locally* flocked together* into strong teams
</I>&gt;<i> with lateral P2P  links between themselves. Bands of new middle class
</I>&gt;<i> activists/ troupes that clustered/ coagulated around certain tasks and
</I>&gt;<i> issues with the help of internet networking and by finding
</I>&gt;<i> volunteer-specialists who could help solve problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What these flocks do is P2P value creation. Groups of professionals and
</I>&gt;<i> connectivists, each of them very good at something with unique skills and
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge interconnect at a site and/or online to design something, solve
</I>&gt;<i> problems together or create new idea's or concepts by synergy from mixes of
</I>&gt;<i> available idea's or skills. Working network relations are more important
</I>&gt;<i> than ego or position. A very successful example of this is the networked
</I>&gt;<i> assistance for small communities in emerging countries organized by
</I>&gt;<i> NABUUR.com [11]. On a larger scale this synergy happens in new value chains
</I>&gt;<i> between specialised small companies in the new network economy. Problematic
</I>&gt;<i> is that &quot;managers&quot; and bureacratic planners are in this new (III) context
</I>&gt;<i> less relevant or at least not at the core of the primary process anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> Often they fail to grasp what is going on. Clueless. Or if they do try to
</I>&gt;<i> simplify, linearize and freeze the new living complex, nonlinear and dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> situation by imposing even more control and red tape, which puts them in a
</I>&gt;<i> parallel bureaucratic universe of 'nowhere men' which may fade away sooner
</I>&gt;<i> or later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The power of flocking via networks*
</I>&gt;<i> Broadcasting has a network effect in the sense that for the maker of the
</I>&gt;<i> publicity and for instance the state propaganda (see (I) above) the value of
</I>&gt;<i> the medium (1:N, one to many)grows with the number N of readers/viewers
</I>&gt;<i> (eyeballs). This is Sarnoff's Law V ~ N = 1+1+1+1+ ...., which is additive,
</I>&gt;<i> and in some cases of celeb fame addictive. Communication (1:1, one on one
</I>&gt;<i> dialogues) between N people  grows in value for the network provider as N *
</I>&gt;<i> N-1 = N squared, So it is stronger and more valuable than broadcasting N.
</I>&gt;<i> Content is not king !! This is Metcalffe's Law. A better version on this law
</I>&gt;<i> is the Odlyzko-Tilly's Law: V ~ N * Log N.  And state dialogues with
</I>&gt;<i> citizens (II) are also valuable but only N to 1 which is also additive. The
</I>&gt;<i> third networking law is that value for the participants themselves is
</I>&gt;<i> growing by being able to be part a number of tribes or flokcs at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time on- and offline which was defined as Reed's Law which is Value ~ 2 to
</I>&gt;<i> the power of N, which is the amount of flocks you can be member of / or not
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time.  I have defined a fourth law in which the value for each
</I>&gt;<i> participant grows with N ! of unique and different participants and idea's !
</I>&gt;<i> you can collaborate with is a number of combinations [8]. Van Till's Law of
</I>&gt;<i> synergy by networkcombinations: Value ~ N ! = N * N-1 * N-2 * N-3* ......*1.
</I>&gt;<i>  To summarize for those who start see dizzy when confronted with math
</I>&gt;<i> formula's, the above simply says that propaganda and topdown control (I)
</I>&gt;<i> only grows in power additive 1+1+1..., hence their craving for mass
</I>&gt;<i> audiences. And on the new side of network society value for each participant
</I>&gt;<i> grows multiplicative by connecting flocks of unique and creative
</I>&gt;<i> professionals (III) who can organise themselves. Their combined network
</I>&gt;<i> power is stronger!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Network power grows by leaps and bursts.*
</I>&gt;<i> One of the first scientists who studied the emerging phenomena of the
</I>&gt;<i> coming &quot;information society&quot; was the enlightened prof Tom Stonier. In a
</I>&gt;<i> groundbreaking paper [9] he
</I>&gt;<i> (double logarithmic) charted the teledensity, then fixed telephone lines /
</I>&gt;<i> 100 inhabitants, in a number of countries versus the average BNP.  These two
</I>&gt;<i> are highly correlated and show a remarkable range of different incomes and
</I>&gt;<i> teledensities. But what is more important that countries which over the
</I>&gt;<i> years broke though the threshold of 20 phonelines/ 100 inhabitants all
</I>&gt;<i> changed regime. Stonier stated &quot;no dictator can survive for any length of
</I>&gt;<i> time in communicative society (III) as the flows of information can no
</I>&gt;<i> longer be controlled from the centre (I)&quot; In this paper he did rather
</I>&gt;<i> precisely forcats the fall of the USSR around 1990. He later explained that
</I>&gt;<i> the teledensity was just a measure of a new middle class of Wired &quot;knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> workers&quot; appearing, or what we now would call the online highly educated
</I>&gt;<i> young creative class alive on bandwidth. in fact dring an interview one of
</I>&gt;<i> the generals in Moskou who tried and fail with the countercoup (g) said that
</I>&gt;<i> he was baffled by a totaly new type of workers/activists on the streets:
</I>&gt;<i> young knowledge workers!. So a certain density of internet &amp; cellphone
</I>&gt;<i> connections must be present to make the transition on a wider scale in a
</I>&gt;<i> country. So the process of renewal is discontinous once thresholds are
</I>&gt;<i> crossed. And on the charts of teledensties of cellphones and FttH there will
</I>&gt;<i> be serveral such distinctive thresholds in flocking behaviour. And the
</I>&gt;<i> transitions are unstoppable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *No new network society innovation without rebels.*
</I>&gt;<i> Wether vested parties or companies like it or not these transitions do
</I>&gt;<i> appear in various breakthrough disruptive innovations as well and also
</I>&gt;<i> businesses start to think in terms of co-creation of new products and
</I>&gt;<i> services in a process which is driven by black swan rebels and activists.
</I>&gt;<i> Prof. Rao of Princeton University wrote an interesting account of these
</I>&gt;<i> activist movements in his recent book  [10]. Rao quotes the advice a famous
</I>&gt;<i> American social community organizer Alinsky (1909 - 1972) gave to rebels
</I>&gt;<i> active in mobilizing communities to act in common self-interest in the form
</I>&gt;<i> of five rules to link hot causes and emotions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. *Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it*. The
</I>&gt;<i> opposition must be singled out as the target and &quot;frozen&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. *Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.* It is almost imposible to
</I>&gt;<i> counterattack ridicule. It also infuriates the opposition, who then reacts
</I>&gt;<i> to your advantage.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. *Never go outside the experience of your people.* When an action is
</I>&gt;<i> outside the experience of the ppl the result is confusion, fear and retreat.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. *Whenever possible go outside of the experience of the enemy*. Here you
</I>&gt;<i> want to cause confusion confusion, fear and retreat.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it can hardly be a coincidence that both Barack Obama, now Prez of
</I>&gt;<i> the USA and Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State (minister of foreign
</I>&gt;<i> affairs) both where students of
</I>&gt;<i> Alinsky, so they will be I assume very much aware of flocking network power
</I>&gt;<i> all over the globe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So cellphones and internetconnected laptops are not politically neutral
</I>&gt;<i> stuff, in the hands of the emerging class of young flocking netizen
</I>&gt;<i> professionals they will be more powerfull than destructive men with
</I>&gt;<i> motorcycles, clubs and axes. Thus the little birds will not only twitter and
</I>&gt;<i> tweet but will also flock in networked groups and then they will suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> swarm up high above all of us.
