The larger novel shows a series of alternative societies.

That specific story shows determined non-violent opposition to exploitation
of a social network.

Though, personally, I can see there a tension between an inclusive gift
economy and an exclusive peer barter network an outlined there, so it's not
necessarily an ideal as much as something to think about.

</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;You&#8217;re making one right now.&#8217; announced Gleed, his voice hard and edgy.
</I>&gt;<i> He nudged Harrison. &#8216;Watch this.&#8217; His hand came out of a side pocket
</I>&gt;<i> holding
</I>&gt;<i> a tiny gun. Pointing it at Matt&#8217;s middle, he said, &#8216;Ordinarily I could get
</I>&gt;<i> into trouble for this, if those on the ship were in the mood to make
</I>&gt;<i> trouble. But they aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re more than tired of you two-legged mules.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> He motioned with the weapon.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;So start walking and fetch us two full plates.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said Matt, firming his lips and ignoring the gun. Gleed thumbed
</I>&gt;<i> the safety-catch which moved with an audible click. &#8216;It&#8217;s touchy now. It&#8217;d
</I>&gt;<i> go off at a sneeze. Get moving.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said Matt.
</I>&gt;<i>  With unconcealed disgust, Gleed shoved the weapon back into his pocket. &#8216;I
</I>&gt;<i> was only kidding you. It isn&#8217;t loaded.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t have made the slightest difference if it had been,&#8217; Matt
</I>&gt;<i> assured. &#8216;I serve no Antigands and that is that.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;What if I&#8217;d lost control of myself and blown several large holes in you?&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;How could I have served you then?&#8217; asked Matt. &#8216;A dead person is of no
</I>&gt;<i> use to anyone. It&#8217;s time You Antigands learned a little logic.&#8217; With which
</I>&gt;<i> parting shot he meandered off.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;He&#8217;s got something there,&#8217; offered Harrison, patently depressed. &#8216;What
</I>&gt;<i> can you do with a corpse? Nothing whatever. A body is in nobody&#8217;s power.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. A couple of stiffs lying around might sharpen the

</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;You&#8217;re thinking of them in Terran terms,&#8217; Harrison said. &#8216;It&#8217;s a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i> They are not Terrans no matter where they came from originally. They are

</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;Well, just what are Gands supposed to be?&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a safe bet they&#8217;re some kind of fanatics. Terra

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pole has seemed the only way to solve their problems &#8220;permanently&#8220;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I was in a high school social studies class, the causes of World War
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were explained:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> World War I (abbreviated as WW-I, WWI, or WW1), also known as the First
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> World War, the Great War, and the War to End All Wars, was a global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> military
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conflict that embroiled most of the world's great powers,[1] assembled in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two opposing alliances: the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance.[2]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 70 million military personnel were mobilized in one of the largest wars in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history.[3] The main combatants descended into a state of total war,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pumping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their entire scientific and industrial capabilities into the war effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over 15 million people were killed, making it one of the deadliest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conflicts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in history. The immediate or proximate cause of war was the assassination
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Austro-Hungarian throne, by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Austria-Hungary's resulting demands against the Kingdom of Serbia
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> activated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a sequence of alliances. Within weeks the major European powers were at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> war;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their global empires meant that the conflict soon spread worldwide.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That &quot;activation of a sequence&quot; of alliances was the key bit, where all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliances were of the form, &quot;if you attack anyone in the alliance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the alliance will attack you back&quot;. So, two tiny countries have a tiny
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> border dispute or tiny trade dispute, and soon the whole world then is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fighting each other. From a global systems perspective, this is a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stupid way to organize military alliances. That form of alliance is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to *amplify* conflict with positive feedback, not damp down conflict with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> negative feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, I thought about that, and I am still proud to say I came up with this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea then as an alternative sitting in social studies class (and no doubt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else has had it, but I have not seen it yet, but I have not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about it in years or looked for a parallel).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is the key idea: a peer-to-peer security alliance should be of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different form than a mutual defense pact against outsiders. It should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more like a mutual attack pact against insiders, where if anyone in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliance attacks another peer in the alliance (or violates an agreed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boundary in some way), then the *entire* rest of the alliance agrees takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> action against the peer violating the boundary or doing the aggressive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing. This alliance says nothing about what the alliance will do if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threatened from outside. It is purely a set of rules about normative peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior inside the alliance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, imagine we start this peer-to-peer alliance of countries with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Netherlands and Singapore, at opposite ends of the world (although both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerned about trade). In order to form it, both need to agree to some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basic code of international conduct, as well as formalize their borders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respect to each other, and resolve any current trade disputes. Then, say,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Estonia decides to join. It to must agree with the previous border claims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Netherlands and Singapore with respect to itself (and other economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regulations as well as rules for amending the alliance charter, and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively, in the process of joining, Estonia needs to get the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Netherlands and Singapore to alter aspects of the alliance including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> borders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a way that all the countries in the alliance can agree on (so,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is 100% consensus within the alliance on the changes or the new country
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not join).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, you may ask, what is the point of the Netherlands, Singapore, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Estonia agreeing to not attack each other (like they would even dream of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that) and to adhere to some generally recognized international laws they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely already following? What would be the point in the Netherlands and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Singapore agreeing that Estonia could step in to stop a very unlikely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> military conflict between the two, Estonia likely having few troops and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ships and little chance of accomplishing anything by itself beyond some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk? The value begins to grow as more countries join. So, with more and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more countries, there would be increasing value in the agreement to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the other countries in a growing alliance to step in and stop conflicts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which any country initiates against other peer countries in the alliance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times goes by, Venezuela might join, and then Canada, and then joining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliance might be the sensible thing to do because it will be a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organization setting standards and promoting good things across the peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network. Eventually, a country will want to join who has a border dispute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic dispute with another country already in the alliance (say, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Russia wants to join and Japan has already joined, and they dispute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ownership of some islands). In order to join this alliance, the countries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved will need to work out their dispute. There may eventually be an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enormous incentive to join this organization, so, say the value of joining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may be bigger than the value of some few islands that are disputed, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there would be a big incentive to bring in even more countries to assure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global mutual security by those in the alliance, so, there is a big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incentive by all peers to resolve these conflicts before they lead to war,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even if significant concessions needed to be made. Eventually, there might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a situation where there are a few big holdouts, like the USA, if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree with everyone else's border claims or figure out a way to resolve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there might be enormous internal political pressure on those last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> holdouts to joint to support world peace. It would at least be pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious at that point what countries were not willing to get along with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their peers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually, this alliance might replace the United Nations. Alternatively,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this alliance forming process might actually be done through the United
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nations as a series of new treaties with new governing structures. Note,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is *not* the same as world government. This is a set of rules for how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peers should behave towards each other. And it is also, ideally, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for solving conflicts before they reach the point of economic war or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical war (given economic war and physical war are often interrelated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with one causing the other).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note the big difference of this form of alliance than the conventional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> form, including this new &quot;Polario&quot; idea. There is no reason for a set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big blocks which might end up attacking each other. There is the potential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for this one alliance to spread globally and define the norms under which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peers (countries) interact with each other under the terms of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure what would happen if two such alliances started to form, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideally, they would negotiate at least a common denominator for borders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trade rules and then merge. But even if two alliances could not agree,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would still not pose any threat to each other, because there is nothing in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the alliance about how to interact with those outside the alliance. So,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliances could even overlap. There could even be different alliances for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> diferent things (borders versus trade regulations, for example). I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure, as I think about it, what all the implications would be of lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overlapping peer-to-peer alliances of this form?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would this work politically? It entails countries essentially agreeing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be attacked militarily or economically by peers if they violate certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> norms they previously agreed to, or at least, peers agreeing to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attackers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or enforcers, to step in and stop disputes and enforce boundaries. It is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort of global anti-bullying pact among peers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, would this be seen by nations considering joining as essentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> giving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up some of their sovereignty? Well, I don't know. But it is an alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to look at the notions of peer alliances. And it is a way to build a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stronger community that has consensus about some international norms for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peer behavior at a national level as well as some teeth to the enforcement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of those norms as a community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No doubt someone would want to simulate this before trying it to see if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has any obvious failure modes unique to it, like in Model United Nations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exercises.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not even sure there would have to be a violent military aspect to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement. It might be good enough for peers to just say that if a peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transgresses a certain norm or boundary, they would slow or stop their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trade
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with that peer (or reduce their internet bandwidth to that country),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essentially as a form of &quot;shunning&quot; (which is non-violent, but still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disruptive).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunning</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There would then need to be some way to compensate individual businesses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for economic losses. And the bigger alliance agreement would then perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take precedence over contracts between individual businesses across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> borders.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm not sure what the best enforcement strategy for agreed on peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> norms would be in such an alliance. No doubt people would explore that.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mistake as I did.&#8217; Another flick across the corner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;I don&#8217;t make them twice.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;You&#8217;re making one right now.&#8217; announced Gleed, his voice hard and edgy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He nudged Harrison. &#8216;Watch this.&#8217; His hand came out of a side pocket
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> holding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a tiny gun. Pointing it at Matt&#8217;s middle, he said, &#8216;Ordinarily I could get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into trouble for this, if those on the ship were in the mood to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trouble. But they aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re more than tired of you two-legged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mules.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He motioned with the weapon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;So start walking and fetch us two full plates.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said Matt, firming his lips and ignoring the gun. Gleed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thumbed the safety-catch which moved with an audible click. &#8216;It&#8217;s touchy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now. It&#8217;d go off at a sneeze. Get moving.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said Matt.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  With unconcealed disgust, Gleed shoved the weapon back into his pocket.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8216;I was only kidding you. It isn&#8217;t loaded.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t have made the slightest difference if it had been,&#8217; Matt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assured. &#8216;I serve no Antigands and that is that.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;What if I&#8217;d lost control of myself and blown several large holes in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you?&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;How could I have served you then?&#8217; asked Matt. &#8216;A dead person is of no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use to anyone. It&#8217;s time You Antigands learned a little logic.&#8217; With which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parting shot he meandered off.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;He&#8217;s got something there,&#8217; offered Harrison, patently depressed. &#8216;What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can you do with a corpse? Nothing whatever. A body is in nobody&#8217;s power.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. A couple of stiffs lying around might sharpen the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others. They&#8217;d become really eager.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;You&#8217;re thinking of them in Terran terms,&#8217; Harrison said. &#8216;It&#8217;s a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mistake. They are not Terrans no matter where they came from originally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They are Gands.&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;Well, just what are Gands supposed to be?&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a safe bet they&#8217;re some kind of fanatics. Terra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exported one-track-minders by the millions around the time of the Great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Explosion. Look at that crazy crowd on Hygeia, for instance.&#8217; ...
