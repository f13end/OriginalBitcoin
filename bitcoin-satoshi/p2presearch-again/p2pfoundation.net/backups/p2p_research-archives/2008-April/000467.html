<PRE>&gt;<i> Where to Find Free Images and Visuals
</I>&gt;<i> Sites and search engines for finding high-quality free pictures
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> November 8, 2006
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This article has been modified from Where to Find Free Images and
</I>&gt;<i> Visuals for My Blog by Robin Good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finding quality images and photos to complement an important article,
</I>&gt;<i> essay, or news report is already a challenge in itself. Imagine, then,
</I>&gt;<i> when the goal is not only to find good images, but also ones you can use
</I>&gt;<i> without having to pay royalties or purchase one-time publishing rights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The task would seem, at first, a challenging one, especially since,
</I>&gt;<i> until recently, there were few well-known free image resources available
</I>&gt;<i> online. Today, however, new ones are popping up all over the Web,
</I>&gt;<i> offering a great assortment of quality pictures and presenting an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to traditional, expensive stock-photography libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as you don't require photos of artistic masterpieces or images
</I>&gt;<i> of popular celebrities, you are likely to find highly interesting,
</I>&gt;<i> affordable visual alternatives by exploring the world of free and
</I>&gt;<i> grassroots online image banks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, too, to always check the licensing terms of any image you wish
</I>&gt;<i> to use (for more information about permissions, see TechSoup's article
</I>&gt;<i> Borrowing Images from the Web: An FAQ.) And no matter what your source,
</I>&gt;<i> always try to credit the artist, and, when possible, send a link. This
</I>&gt;<i> is an easy way to thank someone who has been so generous as to offer her
</I>&gt;<i> creative work to you for free, and allows the artist to link back to
</I>&gt;<i> your site to show potential customers how her work has been used.
</I>&gt;<i> Free Online Image Banks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bigfoto.com
</I>&gt;<i> Bigfoto.com is a repository of photos whose main categories include
</I>&gt;<i> America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Pacific. When you select a category,
</I>&gt;<i> a menu with a list of subcategories appears below it; selecting a
</I>&gt;<i> subcategory will take you a page with thumbnails and information about
</I>&gt;<i> the topic. For example, Themes &gt; Aviation leads you to a page with
</I>&gt;<i> aviation photos, as well as a description of the Wright brothers and
</I>&gt;<i> Charles Lindbergh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the bottom of the Web site, you'll see a link called &quot;pps,&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> contains PowerPoint presentations for downloading and admiring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Geek Philosopher
</I>&gt;<i> Geek Philosopher offers a collection of photos, backgrounds, and
</I>&gt;<i> wallpaper organized into nine main categories, each with additional
</I>&gt;<i> subcategories. If you use an image, the site requires you to include a
</I>&gt;<i> link to Geek Philosopher. According to the site, you are free to do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever you want with these photos except redistribute them. (Learn
</I>&gt;<i> more by checking out the site's terms and conditions.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fotogenika.net
</I>&gt;<i> Fotogenika.net contains photos sorted into a handful of categories and
</I>&gt;<i> subcategories. Images from this site &quot;may be used freely for personal,
</I>&gt;<i> educational, and nonprofit projects. You may not use them commercially,
</I>&gt;<i> claim authorship, and/or sell them.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A category page displays subcategory folders with thumbnails (or, when
</I>&gt;<i> there's no subcategory, thumbnail images only). Categories include
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, animals, people, landscapes, objects, and textures. Some
</I>&gt;<i> categories only have one page of photos, while others have more. It's a
</I>&gt;<i> well-organized site that's easy to use and offers a lovely collection of
</I>&gt;<i> high-quality images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreeImages.co.uk
</I>&gt;<i> FreeImages.co.uk has more than 2,500 stock photos. The home page lists
</I>&gt;<i> the top three galleries; you can search for photos by gallery or by
</I>&gt;<i> using the gallery index page's search tool. When you select a thumbnail
</I>&gt;<i> from the gallery page, the picture appears in its full size and without
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreeImages.co.uk also offers ideas and tips on resolution and how to get
</I>&gt;<i> the best out of the images. It also has a collection of desktop
</I>&gt;<i> wallpapers and presentation slides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreeDigitalPhotos.net
</I>&gt;<i> FreeDigitalPhotos.net has over 2,000 free images for use in commercial
</I>&gt;<i> and non-commercial work as long as you don't claim them as your own,
</I>&gt;<i> redistribute them, or offer them for sale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Browse photos by category or use the search tool. Each category has
</I>&gt;<i> subcategories, which may even have subcategories of their own. The
</I>&gt;<i> subcategory thumbnails display the title and the number of times the
</I>&gt;<i> image has been viewed. Click the thumbnail to see a larger view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The home page displays a random image, which you can refresh to change.
</I>&gt;<i> It's an easy-to-use site with a good collection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreePhotosBank
</I>&gt;<i> FreePhotosBank grants visitors a non-exclusive, non-transferable license
</I>&gt;<i> to use its images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Search or browse categories to find photos, or check out new or randomly
</I>&gt;<i> selected photos featured on the home page. Click the Hot List button to
</I>&gt;<i> see the most popular photos as well as photos with the highest ratings,
</I>&gt;<i> most views, and most downloads. Some photos have an added digital
</I>&gt;<i> effect, meaning you'll find a diverse array of photos on FreePhotosBank
</I>&gt;<i> you might not find on other photo sites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each photo comes with information regarding its size, rating, number of
</I>&gt;<i> views, number of downloads, and the photographer's information. You can
</I>&gt;<i> also email the photo to a friend or print it. You can download the image
</I>&gt;<i> as a JPEG or as a Zip file. You'll find a quality collection with
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of photos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Free Stock Photos
</I>&gt;<i> Free Stock Photos is a collection of free photos available for use in
</I>&gt;<i> personal and commercial design projects (see the terms of use for
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines). Images come in multiple sizes for downloading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreeMediaGoo
</I>&gt;<i> FreeMediaGoo has a collection of royalty-free images, audio, textures,
</I>&gt;<i> and Flash animation available for commercial and private use (with some
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions) free of charge. It is not necessary to credit the images
</I>&gt;<i> you use. Images are sorted by category, including beach, aviation,
</I>&gt;<i> buildings, finance, sports, foods, and others. You can find original and
</I>&gt;<i> awe-inspiring digital images in the site's digital factory category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  From Old Books
</I>&gt;<i>  From Old Books is a unique collection of over 800 images in the public
</I>&gt;<i> domain (unless otherwise noted) scanned from books. The site has many
</I>&gt;<i> pictures of castles, abbeys, and old houses. The home page displays new
</I>&gt;<i> images and a search tool with various sorting options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you find a photo of interest, click on it to see its title, source,
</I>&gt;<i> the place it depicts (if applicable), keywords, copyright status, file
</I>&gt;<i> name, and notes. Each photo also comes in several dimensions, and you
</I>&gt;<i> can download by simply clicking on the size you want. From Old Books
</I>&gt;<i> offers many photos you won't find elsewhere that can add character to
</I>&gt;<i> any project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ImageBase
</I>&gt;<i> ImageBase is a collection of over a few hundred photos of nature,
</I>&gt;<i> people, cities, and objects taken by (presumably) one photographer,
</I>&gt;<i> David Niblack. Though a small database in comparison to others, you can
</I>&gt;<i> expect to find quality photos here. The site clearly states that &quot;all
</I>&gt;<i> images are 100 percent free to use.&quot; Click on one of the categories to
</I>&gt;<i> view thumbnails; after clicking on a thumbnail, the full image appears
</I>&gt;<i> on the right. If you click on the full image, it takes you to the next
</I>&gt;<i> image in that category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Image*After
</I>&gt;<i> Image*After is a free online photo collection. Download and use any
</I>&gt;<i> image or &quot;texture&quot; --- close-ups of elements such as fur, food, and
</I>&gt;<i> fabrics, and more --- from the site to use in personal or commercial
</I>&gt;<i> work (see the site's terms of use for licensing information). A series
</I>&gt;<i> of drop-down menus let you browse images and textures by category; you
</I>&gt;<i> can also look for images via a search feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Image*After's clipping tool is a nice feature that you rarely see on
</I>&gt;<i> free photo sites. Click the scissors icon to &quot;clip&quot; a photo; when you're
</I>&gt;<i> done clipping, you can review all of your clipped images in one page by
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on the bigger scissors icon next to the die icon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mayang's Free Textures
</I>&gt;<i> Mayang's Free Textures is a library of over 3,000 textures from
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, buildings, fabric, man-made items, metal, nature, plants,
</I>&gt;<i> stone, and wood. Images are high resolution at 1600x1200 pixels or
</I>&gt;<i> larger, with most at 2560x1920 pixels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All images are free for all uses, but can't be sold; crediting the site
</I>&gt;<i> is also appreciated. Mayang's Free Textures has a mailing list for those
</I>&gt;<i> who wish to be notified when new textures are added.
</I>&gt;<i> Downloads are limited to 20 textures per day. (The site will let you
</I>&gt;<i> know how many you've downloaded.) Each image comes with a caption
</I>&gt;<i> describing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all images look like background pictures, especially the autos
</I>&gt;<i> collection, so don't let the term &quot;texture&quot; throw you off. The aerial
</I>&gt;<i> view of Paris and other locales are amazing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MorgueFile
</I>&gt;<i> MorgueFile contains free, high-resolution digital stock photographs and
</I>&gt;<i> reference images for corporate or public use. The official purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> MorgueFile is to provide free image reference materials for all creative
</I>&gt;<i> pursuits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MorgueFile's archive contains over 55,000 digital images, which can be
</I>&gt;<i> searched and accessed through a broad set of well-organized categories,
</I>&gt;<i> including animals, objects, people, and scenes, all via a simple, quick
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While some may find the MorgueFile thumbnails too small, two features
</I>&gt;<i> compensate for this: the fast-displaying search results and the photo
</I>&gt;<i> quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> National Park Service
</I>&gt;<i> National Park Service has about 13,000 images available in the public
</I>&gt;<i> domain for use, free of charge as long as you credit the photo as &quot;NPS
</I>&gt;<i> Photo&quot; or &quot;NPS Photo by (photographer's name).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The photos are specifically related to Yellowstone National Park, with
</I>&gt;<i> categories including animals, fire, geology, park structures, special
</I>&gt;<i> events, and more. The Park Services plans to continue scanning and
</I>&gt;<i> posting those that aren't yet online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Photo
</I>&gt;<i> The Open Photo Project is a stock photography community and framework
</I>&gt;<i> whose purpose is to allow photographers to share and protect their works
</I>&gt;<i> through Creative Commons licensing. Mousing over the thumbnails allows
</I>&gt;<i> you to view each photo's licensing information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The site uses a wiki to manage its collection; you must register in
</I>&gt;<i> order to contribute to the site or access other features. Click the Spy
</I>&gt;<i> tab at the top of the home page to see what photos other users are
</I>&gt;<i> admiring, or find pictures by category or using the search tool. The
</I>&gt;<i> site offers RSS feeds so you can keep track of new photos when they're
</I>&gt;<i> added.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PD Photo
</I>&gt;<i> PDPhoto.org is a repository for free public-domain photos. It contains
</I>&gt;<i> about 2,000 photographs --- most of them by the same photographer ---
</I>&gt;<i> organized by category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless an image is clearly marked as copyrighted, you can assume it is
</I>&gt;<i> free to use. Pictures featuring products or property should also be used
</I>&gt;<i> with care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The home page links to the newest photos, the site author's favorite
</I>&gt;<i> photos, the most-viewed photos, and recent comments from the site's
</I>&gt;<i> forum, which resembles a guest book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Photocase
</I>&gt;<i> Photocase contains a repository of photos and a community that includes
</I>&gt;<i> forums, polls, buddy lists, and user profiles. (The site was formerly
</I>&gt;<i> located at Photocase.de, so check your bookmarks to make sure they're
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Photocase images may be used for commercial and noncommercial
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained original work. You can download up to three photos per
</I>&gt;<i> day; if you need to download more, the site requires buying download
</I>&gt;<i> credits. You can also get five download credits for every picture you
</I>&gt;<i> upload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Photocase also has a magazine with articles, short stories, and a photo
</I>&gt;<i> contest. To download photos, you must register (which is free);
</I>&gt;<i> registering allows you to join the Photocase community, upload photos,
</I>&gt;<i> and personalize your account. Photocase can be viewed in German or
</I>English.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Photo Rogue
</I>&gt;<i> Photo Rogue has a unique concept: If you can't find a picture you need,
</I>&gt;<i> submit a request to Photo Rogue and they'll try to fulfill it. Before
</I>&gt;<i> submitting a request, review the guidelines. The service is free and
</I>&gt;<i> relies on volunteer photographers; you can read more about the usage
</I>&gt;<i> terms in the Volunteering FAQ. The site also offers an RSS feed to
</I>&gt;<i> notify you when new images are posted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pixel Perfect Digital
</I>&gt;<i> Pixel Perfect Digital offers more than 4,000 images sorted into 146
</I>&gt;<i> categories, free for commercial and non-commercial use. The newest files
</I>&gt;<i> appear on the gallery home page; a random selection of other images
</I>&gt;<i> appears at the bottom of the page. You can stay on top of the newest
</I>&gt;<i> files by subscribing to Pixel Perfect Digital's RSS feed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Details accompanying each thumbnail include the photographer's name,
</I>&gt;<i> size, number of views, number of downloads, and the average rating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pixel Perfect Digital's licensing terms allow you to use its images in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;as many projects as necessary, including those you are creating for
</I>&gt;<i> your clients,&quot; but forbid you from selling or redistributing them, even
</I>&gt;<i> in modified form, without the company's written consent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stock XChng
</I>&gt;<i> One of the best resources of free images online is Stock XChng, which
</I>&gt;<i> includes an impressive collection of high-quality photos taken by
</I>&gt;<i> amateur photographers from around the world. In fact, you too can be one
</I>&gt;<i> of the many contributors to this outstanding and fast-growing image
</I>&gt;<i> clearinghouse by submitting your own photographs to the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stock XChng images are searchable in multiple ways, and offer thumbnail
</I>&gt;<i> views large enough to provide a good preview of what the shots contain,
</I>&gt;<i> unlike other alternative image libraries that have overly reduced the
</I>&gt;<i> size of their thumbnails, making it harder to appreciate the image's
</I>&gt;<i> content without loading a larger version of it --- a step that can add a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of additional time to the search process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stock XChng archives more than 100,000 images. Photographers establish
</I>&gt;<i> the use terms, and most images are available for immediate reuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stockvault
</I>&gt;<i> Stockvault is a stock photography resource that offers medium-sized
</I>&gt;<i> images for personal and non-commercial use. The site features images
</I>&gt;<i> from various photographers, both professional and amateur, and offers an
</I>&gt;<i> impressive array of awe-inspiring shots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To view the photos, go to the Stockgallery, where you can browse over
</I>&gt;<i> 2,300 images by category. You can rate photos, search for photos with
</I>&gt;<i> top ratings, or click on the Photographers tab, where you can find out
</I>&gt;<i> what cameras photographers featured on the site use and where they are
</I>from.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unprofound.com
</I>&gt;<i> Unprofound.com is a collection of photos sorted by basic colors instead
</I>&gt;<i> of the usual categories. White, however, isn't white, but rather is
</I>&gt;<i> found under the &quot;everything else&quot; category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The home page explains the terms of use: you can use images any way you
</I>&gt;<i> like, but don't redistribute them. Pick a color, any color, to see photos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visipix
</I>&gt;<i> Visipix is an art museum, clip art, and photo gallery with around
</I>&gt;<i> 100,000 exhibits. If you publish a Vispix photo, the site requires that
</I>&gt;<i> you credit the authors and Vispix near the photo. All images are free,
</I>&gt;<i> but can't be used in the sex industry or to promote the sale of tobacco
</I>&gt;<i> or alcohol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Clips section contains clip art, but most samples are photos rather
</I>&gt;<i> than flat images. You can zoom in on pictures using Visipix's Java tool.
</I>&gt;<i> Just click on the image to zoom in; hold Shift while clicking to zoom
</I>&gt;<i> out. The Start Mirror button shows a mirrored version of the photo; as
</I>&gt;<i> the site explains, this is to help Westerners view Eastern art in the
</I>&gt;<i> way it was intended and vice versa. Each picture comes in multiple sizes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Be aware that it's not always clear which images are copyrighted and
</I>&gt;<i> which aren't. This site has many wonderful things to discover, so be
</I>&gt;<i> prepared to spend a lot of time once you get there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Woophy
</I>&gt;<i> Woophy has a collection of over 23,000 photos from around the world,
</I>&gt;<i> with over 4,300 cities represented. You can search by city,
</I>&gt;<i> highest-rated photos, country, category keywords, or member to find
</I>&gt;<i> photos. The categories are animals, culture, landmarks and buildings,
</I>&gt;<i> nature, objects, and people. You can also limit the search results by
</I>&gt;<i> date and number of views.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A world map appears on the site and you can click on a city to view the
</I>&gt;<i> pictures taken there. At the bottom of the map you'll find statistics,
</I>&gt;<i> the number of pictures added in the last 24 hours, the featured city of
</I>&gt;<i> the day, the member of the month, latest user comments, and news.
</I>&gt;<i> Searching for the Right Image
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't find what you're looking for on one of the free online
</I>&gt;<i> image banks, try using one of the following search engines to find that
</I>&gt;<i> extra-special image for your Web site or next report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ask.com Picture Search
</I>&gt;<i> Ask.com Picture Search is a search engine that locates images by
</I>&gt;<i> keyword. Its advanced search feature lets you conduct more detailed
</I>&gt;<i> searches by selecting words to include or exclude, language, domain or
</I>&gt;<i> site, geographical area, and date modified. You can save these settings
</I>&gt;<i> or restore default settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Picture Search's copyright disclaimer clearly states that search results
</I>&gt;<i> are protected by copyright and trademark laws; whether or not you can
</I>&gt;<i> use the pictures depends on the rules of the site where you find them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every image found by Picture Search appears with two links: Info and
</I>&gt;<i> Save. Info provides the file name, URL, and the page where the image
</I>&gt;<i> lives; Save stores the images on a page where you can refer to them later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you've saved images, click the My Saved Results button at the top
</I>&gt;<i> of the thumbnails page. There, you can move images to another folder,
</I>&gt;<i> delete them, print them, or email them. Saved images can be sorted by
</I>&gt;<i> date or title.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Picture Search is a very nice search engine, but remember that the
</I>&gt;<i> search results may not always be free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creative Commons Search
</I>&gt;<i> The Creative Commons search engine locates content on the Web that has
</I>&gt;<i> been published under a Creative Commons license. Still in its beta
</I>&gt;<i> stage, CC Search doesn't yet offer thumbnails of the photos it finds;
</I>&gt;<i> however, as soon as it is able to display more visual data on its search
</I>&gt;<i> results, this will become a popular destination for finding a rich
</I>&gt;<i> selection of free images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Flickr
</I>&gt;<i> Flickr is one of the best ways to store, search, sort, and share your
</I>&gt;<i> photos. This easy-to-use online application has super features and a
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide community of contributors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike your typical photo archive, Flickr is more of a repository of
</I>&gt;<i> personal shots and individual home photo collections than a public
</I>&gt;<i> repository of images to be shared and reused. But with the large amount
</I>&gt;<i> of content available, it's difficult not to find something that fits
</I>&gt;<i> your needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Flickr is free; registration is only required if you want to upload,
</I>&gt;<i> edit, and tag your own digital images. Those who publish images on
</I>&gt;<i> Flickr can select and specify the image's licensing terms --- from all
</I>&gt;<i> rights reserved to any of the Creative Commons licenses. Before
</I>&gt;<i> downloading a photo, read its permissions carefully. (Head to the
</I>&gt;<i> Creative Commons page to find the 100 most recently licensed photos.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google Image Search
</I>&gt;<i> Best known for its Web search engine, Google also offers a separate
</I>&gt;<i> search engine for images only. Keep in mind, however, that because they
</I>&gt;<i> come from all over the Internet, these images may not be free (chances
</I>&gt;<i> are, they aren't). Nonetheless, Google Image Search can still be a
</I>&gt;<i> useful way to locate hard-to-find images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To conduct a search, enter the keyword of the image you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> find (the fewer words, the better). If you get too many results or want
</I>&gt;<i> something more specific, add another word. You can also filter your
</I>&gt;<i> results to omit images from adult sites by going into preferences and
</I>&gt;<i> changing the options under SafeSearch Filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For specific searches, you can also use the advanced search tool, which
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to add additional filters to your search. You can also limit
</I>&gt;<i> your search to images of a specific size, a specific format, and even a
</I>&gt;<i> specific color. Once you find an image, check the source for its
</I>&gt;<i> licensing information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MSN Live Search
</I>&gt;<i> MSN Live Search allows you to search for images by keyword and to sort
</I>&gt;<i> results by size and color. Under Options, you can change display and
</I>&gt;<i> filter options, including language and location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Picsearch
</I>&gt;<i> Picsearch is a search engine that uses its own technology to crawl the
</I>&gt;<i> Web and index images. If you find an image through Picsearch, check the
</I>&gt;<i> site's licensing terms or contact the copyright holder to see if you
</I>&gt;<i> have permission to use it. (Picsearch also provides information on how
</I>&gt;<i> you can prevent your pictures from appearing in its search results.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Family filters are in place at all times, so parents don't have to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about kids turning them off. The Help button explains how to search and
</I>&gt;<i> how to improve your results, while Preferences allows you to change the
</I>&gt;<i> interface language and choose whether you want the results to open in
</I>&gt;<i> the same window or in a new window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Advanced search options let you search for animation or to sort images
</I>&gt;<i> by color or size. Additionally, the results page will suggest relevant
</I>&gt;<i> keywords to help you narrow down or broaden your results. Results are
</I>&gt;<i> displayed as thumbnails, and come with the image's size, source, and
</I>&gt;<i> other information. A nice search tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia available in a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> languages. While its search tool's main purpose is to find entries
</I>&gt;<i> containing the entered keywords, most Wikipedia entries also include an
</I>&gt;<i> image. Some photos displayed on Wikipedia are in the public domain and
</I>&gt;<i> are available for reuse. Click on an image to find out its copyright
</I>status.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo Search
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo Search also allows you to search for images, including clip art.
</I>&gt;<i> Its Advanced Image Search tool allows you to search for specific
</I>&gt;<i> results, including the top-level domain (.com, .edu, .net and so on).
</I>&gt;<i> The site also lists popular image searches so you can see what many
</I>&gt;<i> people are looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo Search also allows you to manage your display preferences,
</I>&gt;<i> including language and layout and to search for multimedia. If you're a
</I>&gt;<i> member of a site like LexisNexis, Yahoo Search also has a feature that
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to search it for images --- though they are likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> copyrighted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yotophoto
</I>&gt;<i> Yotophoto searches multiple photo collection sites for free images. It
</I>&gt;<i> may be a good starting point when you're looking for something specific.
</I>&gt;<i> (For example, the tool found 351 images for the word apple.) Enter a
</I>&gt;<i> keyword into the search box and the results display thumbnails along
</I>&gt;<i> with copyright information, size, and source; a new feature even allows
</I>&gt;<i> you to search images by color.
