</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michel
</I>&gt;<i> I am Paritosh from Pune, India
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with ref to our telcon 2 days back:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Objective for starting WikiOcean-Software unit
</I>&gt;<i> *To build a non-proprietory commercial organization based on revenue
</I>&gt;<i> sharing model. In any business.
</I>&gt;<i> Inspired by free software foundation's model to create software, we decide
</I>&gt;<i> to experiment and extend it to management.
</I>&gt;<i> So we started operating and simultaneously also kept on evolving the model.
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage what to do, what market, how to do, how revenue sharing would
</I>&gt;<i> work, how to decentarlise decision making was not known.
</I>&gt;<i> The concept is now put up at www.wekosystem.org
</I>&gt;<i> We started with software because it has low fixed cost and high margin and
</I>&gt;<i> high growth.
</I>&gt;<i> On average India Software companies figures are
</I>&gt;<i> Salary cost 30%
</I>&gt;<i> Overheads  40%
</I>&gt;<i> Profit          30%
</I>&gt;<i> for product companies it looks still better.
</I>&gt;<i> So if we share all the profit with peers(workers) then retention would we
</I>&gt;<i> higher, growth would we better, customers would be more satisfied.
</I>&gt;<i> *Starting*
</I>&gt;<i> Since last  May 2007  we are working on to build a  peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized business model.
</I>&gt;<i> We hired people on minimum assurance of market level income per month or
</I>&gt;<i> revenue share whichever is higher.
</I>&gt;<i> We did not spend time trying to find people who like the concept and would
</I>&gt;<i> want to support it by working for it free.
</I>&gt;<i> As not much was defined and no such model that we were talking had ever
</I>&gt;<i> worked. Specially given  the economic situation in India its difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> get people to work for concept even if they want to.
</I>&gt;<i> Initially we started with software outsourcing work like website and
</I>&gt;<i> related stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> But soon realized that  building brand to get good billing rate would take
</I>&gt;<i> time, which will make it difficult to retail good people.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the signs of US economic slowdown were quit apparent then, which would
</I>&gt;<i> further put pressure on billing.
</I>&gt;<i> *Focus Change*
</I>&gt;<i> So we decided to focus on ERP and CRM product *integration and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation*, rather than outsourcing to start with.
</I>&gt;<i> India our target market to begin with has no good low cost products for mid
</I>&gt;<i> size companies, with strong GDP growth It appeared very promising.
</I>&gt;<i> We did R&amp;D for 6 + months trying to identify which products to select for
</I>&gt;<i> support based on their architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile since starting we are also developing a product called GnuPool -
</I>&gt;<i> Focus on integrating different products and lot of other imp features.
</I>&gt;<i> GnuPool form the basis on which we plan to integrate and deliver projects.
</I>&gt;<i> *Launching*
</I>&gt;<i> We finally started to market the ERP and CRM in local area around Pune and
</I>&gt;<i> Mumbai by participating in industrial Expos.
</I>&gt;<i> The response has been more than what we  had imagined. Now the marketing
</I>&gt;<i> team 8 peers is also trained.
</I>&gt;<i> Till date we have 7 erp orders total valued at RS 15lacs ($37500), it takes
</I>&gt;<i> average 2 months to close a deal.
</I>&gt;<i> Lot of inquires in process, *expect to break even in next 2 months.*
</I>&gt;<i> Our average monthly expense is Rs 10lacs ($25000).
</I>&gt;<i> *Implementation*
</I>&gt;<i> We have started to implement erp as per requirements from June-08 in 2
</I>&gt;<i> month expect 5 implementation to be completed.
</I>&gt;<i> To de-risk the process we decided to expand the team and create assembly
</I>&gt;<i> line kind of set-up.
</I>&gt;<i> So first focus was to train new people rather than go for implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> This also reduces person dependency, and also increases per person output
</I>&gt;<i> as people can focus on specific areas.
</I>&gt;<i> We are now about 150 peers.
</I>&gt;<i> *Contribution based Revenue Sharing*
</I>&gt;<i> We have designed a model for revenue share based on points called Reppos.
</I>&gt;<i> Reppos are distributed by peers amongst themselves based on quantity and
</I>&gt;<i> quality of work done in that period.
</I>&gt;<i> Reppos are not linked to success or failure of each project, but efforts
</I>&gt;<i> taken to achieve the given targets.
</I>&gt;<i> The registered legal entity does not keep anything for itself. For defined
</I>&gt;<i> in our agreement with peers.
</I>&gt;<i> This model has already evolved to to take care of following questions
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What is share of each individual based on its quantity and quality of
</I>&gt;<i> contribution ? 3 months in use with 100 + peers
</I>&gt;<i> 2) How do you ensure that people also focus on decision and efforts for
</I>&gt;<i> future growth and not just current income ?
</I>&gt;<i> 3) To ensure that all distribution happens on predefined standards without
</I>&gt;<i> any personal decision being involved, to eliminate the chances of disputes ?
</I>&gt;<i> 4) That innovation is rewarded ? model has been adjusted for it, needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be tested.
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Decision making for resouce allocation based on another points called
</I>&gt;<i> Wekos would be implemented 3 months.
</I>&gt;<i> *Website*
</I>&gt;<i> All the above calculation would we available for public to see at our site
</I>&gt;<i> within 1 to 2 months at max which is being updated for the same.
</I>&gt;<i> Our site www.wikiocean.net has lot of missing things as of now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Dimentions of the model* :as evolved over the last year.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Revenue potential* -      is very high as product implementation and
</I>&gt;<i> integration offers good margins
</I>&gt;<i> *Market world over* -      This service has good potential in markets
</I>&gt;<i> world over.
</I>&gt;<i> *Product independent* -  At core their is no product risk as we are
</I>&gt;<i> working on most popular community products. But are not dependent on them.
</I>&gt;<i> *Existing community* -   Huge number of contributers who have no
</I>&gt;<i> alternative but to work for propreitory companies, would love to be part of
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> *Low Capex* -                can be extended at very low to zero cost in
</I>&gt;<i> new areas.
</I>&gt;<i> *Centralization* -            decision are taken by the organization,
</I>&gt;<i> customer interacts with one legal entity only.
</I>&gt;<i> *Decentralization* -         peers take decision based on the track record
</I>&gt;<i> measured by Wekos.
</I>&gt;<i> *Personal Judgement* -   As the model is implemented in phases the role on
</I>&gt;<i> central management is reduced to near zero.
</I>&gt;<i> *Freedom* -                   A peer is free to chose the work, with who
</I>&gt;<i> an how is association or other peers.
</I>&gt;<i> *Minority opinion* -         Through Wekos even people with minority
</I>&gt;<i> opinion can enforce decisions on the system.
</I>&gt;<i>                                   (crazy innovators all always in minority)
</I>&gt;<i> *Equity in Distribution* -  Though no system can claim to 100 % perfect,
</I>&gt;<i> we think at current stage this model is far more efficient in surplus
</I>&gt;<i> distribution as compared to convention ownership based models. But still it
</I>&gt;<i> can compete with those in markets.
</I>&gt;<i> *No Commitments* -       As the model is designed to work in market
</I>&gt;<i> environment, no personal commitment from peers is required, no special
</I>&gt;<i> regulation to enable or protect it, or external subsidy would be required.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers should participate because a model delivers and not because of
</I>&gt;<i> emotional attachment to a cause.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Looking For*
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who would want to join us.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who would want to extend and help us evolve and refine this further.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who are working in similar lines in true spirit of a co-operative.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who could fund new experiments that we are planning.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who could help us explain and document this.
</I>&gt;<i> Peers who could guide us and help us take this concept to potential peers.
</I>&gt;<i>
