</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Ally Kevin Kelly has a terrific piece up about Brian Eno's concept of
</I>&gt;<i> scenius&lt;<A HREF="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php">http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Brian Eno suggested the word to convey the extreme creativity that
</I>&gt;<i> groups, places or &quot;scenes&quot; can occasionally generate. His actual definition
</I>&gt;<i> is: &quot;Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole
</I>&gt;<i> cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their
</I>&gt;<i> best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like genius. Your like-minded
</I>&gt;<i> peers, and the entire environment inspire you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The geography of scenius is nurtured by several factors:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Mutual appreciation -- Risky moves are applauded by the group, subtlety
</I>&gt;<i> is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the shy. Scenius can be
</I>&gt;<i> thought of as the best of peer pressure.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Rapid exchange of tools and techniques -- As soon as something is
</I>&gt;<i> invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly because they
</I>&gt;<i> are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Network effects of success -- When a record is broken, a hit happens, or
</I>&gt;<i> breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the entire scene. This
</I>&gt;<i> empowers the scene to further success.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Local tolerance for the novelties -- The local &quot;outside&quot; does not push
</I>&gt;<i> back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The renegades and
</I>&gt;<i> mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scenius can erupt almost anywhere, and at different scales: in a corner of
</I>&gt;<i> a company, in a neighborhood, or in an entire region.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been lucky enough to be involved (at least peripherally) in a few
</I>&gt;<i> really vibrant scenes of communal innovation, and in my experience, the one
</I>&gt;<i> thing they all have in common is what I've called an epicenter&lt;<A HREF="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//002067.html">http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//002067.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[E]very community needs the space where people who do innovative,
</I>&gt;<i> creative, risky, noble, worldchanging things get together and fuel each
</I>&gt;<i> other's ardor. Meeting your allies -- shaking hands, sitting down and eating
</I>&gt;<i> together, talking, laughing, getting to look one another in the eye, getting
</I>&gt;<i> to know someone in all the rich, primate non-verbal ways which can only
</I>&gt;<i> happen in actual physical proximity -- is powerful. Epicenters are tools.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kevin quite rightly points out that scenius is difficult, if not
</I>&gt;<i> impossible, to create on demand, and the same is true of its epicenters. You
</I>&gt;<i> can't just open a bar and expect collective genius to erupt. Artists can
</I>&gt;<i> tell you that the same thing is true of any form of human creativity -- it
</I>&gt;<i> just doesn't turn on like a tap. But artists can also tell you that while
</I>&gt;<i> you can't command creativity and innovation, you can create a welcoming
</I>&gt;<i> space for it and increase the likelihood that it will show up. It can't be
</I>&gt;<i> commanded, but it can be courted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The art of courting genius is one that people hoping to solve the world's
</I>&gt;<i> big problems would do well to learn, because truly worldchanging solutions
</I>&gt;<i> don't arrive steadily or predictably on schedules as deliverables for
</I>&gt;<i> rational investment. No, truly worldchanging solutions tend to arrive in
</I>&gt;<i> unruly clumps, in great non-linear spills of changed thinking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This reality vexes today's philanthropists and social investors. For the
</I>&gt;<i> past two decades, the trend in the practice of giving money intelligently in
</I>&gt;<i> an effort to do good has been all about measurable outcomes and predictable
</I>&gt;<i> returns on giving. This approach has had some benefit, driving social
</I>&gt;<i> enterprises to leaner operations; but mostly it's been an abject failure.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, as I wrote last summer, many social investors are finding that in
</I>&gt;<i> trying to bring predictability to their work, they've become incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> averse to risk, and that this fear of risky giving has left them almost
</I>&gt;<i> completely incapable of finding and funding efforts that would create the
</I>&gt;<i> conditions for the emergence of the kinds of innovation we most need&lt;<A HREF="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006796.html">http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006796.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Worse yet is the trend towards half-assed citizen media and social
</I>&gt;<i> networking approaches, projects based on the insane assumption that all
</I>&gt;<i> that's needed to court collaborative creativity is a website and a good
</I>&gt;<i> advertising campaign. This tendency to think that innovative collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> comes free of cost, bubbling up out the Internet like spring water, betrays
</I>&gt;<i> a poor understanding of the actual workings of either online collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> or quality thinking. Most often, when these open/ citizen-media/
</I>&gt;<i> online-collaborative approaches work, it's because a core group in the
</I>&gt;<i> project provides most of the important input, and usually curates most of
</I>&gt;<i> the other participants' input into useful forms. So, frequently, funders'
</I>&gt;<i> hopes that they can create transformation on the cheap actually just create
</I>&gt;<i> a system that appears cheap because it externalizes the cost of expert
</I>&gt;<i> participation onto the shoulders of others... and when their enthusiasm lags
</I>&gt;<i> (or they need to get day jobs), the project falters or dies. The examples of
</I>&gt;<i> failed peer-based social innovation efforts outnumber the successful cases
</I>&gt;<i> by orders of magnitude.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect what we need is an exploding number of epicenters, independent
</I>&gt;<i> and creative people and groups, and well-designed networks to support them
</I>&gt;<i> -- things that set the conditions for a planetary explosion of new thinking.
</I>&gt;<i> We need to prepare lots of welcoming spaces where genius can take roost.
</I>&gt;<i> That's going to take some risk-oblivious, keenly perceptive, imaginative
</I>&gt;<i> money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even more, I suspect it's going to take worldchangers understanding how
</I>&gt;<i> valuable networked scenius is, and joining efforts to welcome it into their
</I>&gt;<i> own lives and communities.
