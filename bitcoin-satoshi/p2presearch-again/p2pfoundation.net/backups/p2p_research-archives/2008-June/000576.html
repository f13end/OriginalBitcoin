Stephen Downes and I will be offering an online course starting September
through University of Manitoba on Connectivism and Connective Knowledge. The
course is available for credit (enrollment is required) or for personal
interest (no fee). All discussions and learning resources will be freely
available. More information on how the course is run, weekly topics, etc.,
is available on the course wiki&lt;<A HREF="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/wiki/Connectivism">http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/wiki/Connectivism</A>&gt;.
If you are interested, you can sign up
here&lt;<A HREF="http://www.elearnspace.org/connectivism.html">http://www.elearnspace.org/connectivism.html</A>&gt;in order to receive
more information on participating or enrolling.
If for some reason the above link to the wiki doesn't work, it is also
available here: <A HREF="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/Connectivism">http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/Connectivism</A>
We've set up a course blog &lt;<A HREF="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/connectivism/">http://ltc.umanitoba.ca:83/connectivism/</A>&gt; for
our Connectivism and Connective Knowledge online course. The intention of
the blog is to open up the conversation around course design and delivery
and changing value points in education. The transparency will hopefully
capture some of our (Stephen Downes and myself) thinking around course
design and foster interaction with others on ways to improve delivery.
We're hoping that this course will serve at least three purposes:
1. To address the *questions about value points in education* and the role
of learners and faculty in large scale open courses
2. To *model alternatives to existing course design and delivery* models.
These alternatives are defined by openness, innovation, active
participation, connectedness, and learner autonomy.
3. To *expound connectivism as a learning theory and provide a forum for
critical thought, debate, and consideration* of future steps in research and
implementation.

Reflections on Africa&lt;<A HREF="http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/06/elearning_africa.html">http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/06/elearning_africa.html</A>&gt;:
&quot;My understanding of education and learning technologies is largely confined
to European, Canadian, Australian, and American contexts. While I have
frequent informal interactions with individuals from other regions, my
understanding of the unique challenges facing these areas is limited. In
particular, I'm largely unfamiliar with African, Russian, Asian, Middle
Eastern, and South American use of information communication technology for
teaching and learning. These are all areas on my &quot;must go to&quot; list.&quot;

Cute Kitten Syndrome: Open Educational
Resources:&lt;<A HREF="http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/04/open_educational_resources_fur.html">http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/04/open_educational_resources_fur.html</A>&gt;&quot;Educators
are periodically afflicted with a psychological condition called
&quot;Cute Kitten Syndrome&quot;. This syndrome manifests itself as evoking perceived
universal favor for an idea or concept and with those opposing cast as
lacking some key element that comprises humanity. I mean, really, who
doesn't love cute furry kittens? If a person is to speak against open
educational resources (OERs), they are essentially revealing their callus
nature. But, I must say a few critical things...&quot;

Pedagogy First?
Whatever:&lt;<A HREF="http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/pedagogy_first_whatever.html">http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/pedagogy_first_whatever.html</A>&gt;&quot;In
dealing with faculty and instructional designers, a series of almost
default phrases are vocalized once technology is mentioned: &quot;We need to
start with pedagogy&quot;...&quot;It's pedagogy first&quot;.
Or, whenever I'm in a meeting and someone says &quot;pedagogy first&quot;, the
apparently genetic instinct to nod viciously is enacted by everyone around
the table. &quot;Yes, that is right. We need to have priorities here. Let's tame
technology and focus instead on what we already know and are comfortable
with. Let's ensure that technology does not get away from the tried and true
method of containing innovation and new approaches.&quot;
On the surface, I share this sentiment. I've used it many times as well.
It's a nice comforting way of letting people know that we are people with
good priorities. We are not from the dark side. Come a little closer to the
edge. We are just like you.
Another one of my favorite conversations that cause me to feel with warm,
glowing edu-speak goodness: &quot;We need to design our course/program on sound
pedagogy&quot;.
But my angst can no longer be contained... &quot;

I mean, where did we think this was
going?&lt;<A HREF="http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/i_mean_really_where_did_we_thi.html">http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/i_mean_really_where_did_we_thi.html</A>&gt;:
&quot;But then, what were we expecting? What did we think would happen when
learners started using the web for creating and accessing content? When they
started creating social networks to assist each other in learning? What did
we think would happen when large distributed, global conversations started
to occur around how to teach? What did we expect would happen to classrooms
when the walls became increasingly permeable and learners could directly
access video and audio recordings of experts? What did we think would be the
final outcome of a tremendous shift in control over what and how our
learners deal with content, each other, experts, and the rest of the world?
Did we actually think that we could have a revolution within the confines of
existing structures?&quot;

Networks are getting
faster:&lt;<A HREF="http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/networks_are_getting_faster.html">http://connectivism.ca/blog/2008/03/networks_are_getting_faster.html</A>&gt;&quot;The
network trend has since continued and even accelerated.
del.cio.us, Myspace, Facebook, ustream, and Twitter represent an
acceleration of information sharing on par with the distinction between a
traditional newspaper and blogs. Growing up, my information network was
slow, but social contact was high. In early school years, the information
network accelerated, at the expense of humanness of the exchange. In
university, both information and social networks grew in intensity but did
so separately. And with the growth of network tools for learning,
socialization, and information exchange, the world became rather small.&quot;
