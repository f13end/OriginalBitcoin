If Wikileaks is added to the OFAC list (not appeal-able), a US citizen
who donates to their legal defense or provides other support - not
limited to funds would be guilty of a serious crime

Material Support For Terrorists

04 JAN 2011 07:40 PM

David Cole&#160;thinks&#160;current law makes it too easy to be charged with
that offense, and that some big names have put themselves in legal
jeopardy:

DID former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, former New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Tom Ridge, a former homeland security secretary, and
Frances Townsend, a former national security adviser, all commit a
federal crime last month in Paris&#160;when they spoke in support&#160;of the
Mujahedeen Khalq at a conference organized by the Iranian opposition
group&#8217;s advocates? Free speech, right? Not necessarily.

The problem is that the United States government&#160;has labeled&#160;the
Mujahedeen Khalq a &#8220;foreign terrorist organization,&#8221; making it a crime
to provide it, directly or indirectly, with any material support. And,
according to the Justice Department under Mr. Mukasey himself, as well
as under the current attorney general, Eric Holder, material support
includes not only cash and other tangible aid, but also speech
coordinated with a &#8220;foreign terrorist organization&#8221; for its benefit.
It is therefore a felony, the government has argued, to file an amicus
brief on behalf of a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; group, to engage in public advocacy
to challenge a group&#8217;s &#8220;terrorist&#8221; designation or even to encourage
peaceful avenues for redress of grievances.

Greenwald:

Imagine if a group of leading American liberals met on foreign soil
with -- and expressed vocal support for -- supporters of a terrorist
group that had (a) a long history of hateful anti-American rhetoric,
(b) an active role in both the takeover of a U.S. embassy and Saddam
Hussein's brutal 1991 repression of Iraqi Shiites, (c) extensive
financial and military support from Saddam, (d) multiple acts of
violence aimed at civilians, and (e) years of being designated a
&quot;Terrorist organization&quot; by the U.S. under Presidents of both parties,
a designation which is ongoing? The ensuing uproar and orgies of
denunciation would be deafening.

But on December 23, a group of leading conservatives -- including Rudy
Giuliani and former Bush officials Michael Mukasey, Tom Ridge, and
Fran Townsend --&#160;did exactly that.

Jacob Sullum&#160;wrote&#160;last May about how the War On Terrorism was
morphing into a war on free speech.

</I>&gt;<i> Wants WikiLeaks added to Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons List
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Washington, D.C. &#8211; Today, U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, called on Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to add WikiLeaks and its founder Jullian Assange to the Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). This action by Geithner would prohibit people and companies within U.S. jurisdiction from conducting business with WikiLeaks and Assange. In a letter to Geithner, King wrote that &#8220;the U.S. government simply cannot continue its ineffective piecemeal approach of responding in the aftermath of Wikileaks&#8217; damage. The Administration must act to disrupt the Wikileaks enterprise. The U.S. government should be making every effort to strangle the viability of Assange&#8217;s organization.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Below is the text of the letter from King to Geithner:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> January 12, 2011
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secretary Timothy F. Geithner
</I>&gt;<i> U.S. Department of the Treasury
</I>&gt;<i> 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
</I>&gt;<i> Washington, D.C. 20220
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Secretary Geithner:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I write to urge you to add Julian Assange and his Wikileaks enterprise to the Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons List (the SDN List) maintained by the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> U.S. Department of Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), and thus prohibit any company or person subject to U.S. jurisdiction from conducting any business with Assange and Wikileaks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, several prominent officials from the Obama Administration, including Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Department of State Secretary Hilary Clinton, have warned of the threat that Wikileaks and Assange pose to U.S. national security interests. On January 7th, the New York Times reported that Wikileaks&#8217; unauthorized disclosures have forced the State Department to warn &#8220;hundreds of human rights activists, foreign government officials and business people identified in leaked diplomatic cables of potential threats to their safety and has moved a handful of them to safer locations.&#8221; It is undeniable that Wikileaks poses a clear and present threat to U.S. national interests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The U.S. government simply cannot continue its ineffective piecemeal approach of responding in the aftermath of Wikileaks&#8217; damage. The Administration must act to disrupt the Wikileaks enterprise. The U.S. government should be making every effort to strangle the viability of Assange&#8217;s organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to the Department of Treasury, OFAC &#8220;administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against ... threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.&#8221; There have been repeated instances of U.S. companies entering into transactions with Assange, regardless of the consequences. Earlier this year, Amazon, PayPal, and Visa were conducting business with Wikileaks. Fortunately, those companies have withdrawn from their relationships with Assange. However, in late December, U.S. publishing company Alfred A. Knopf announced that it had entered into a publishing deal that would pay Assange approximately $1 million. Mr. Assange commented that he needed those funds to &#8220;keep Wikileaks afloat.&#8221; Assange seems more emboldened than ever in Wikileaks&#8217; continued viability, as he announced yesterday that Wikileaks is &#8220;stepping up our publishing for matters related to [classified U.S. diplomatic cables] and other materials.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The U.S. government should be doing all it can to sink Wikileaks. By adding Assange and Wikileaks to the SDN List, the United States can finally take action to dismantle his organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time and consideration of my request. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PETER T. KING
</I>&gt;<i> Chairman
</I>&gt;<i> Committee on Homeland Security
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And so it starts (in this Congress).&#160; Going to be a bumpy ride&#8230;
