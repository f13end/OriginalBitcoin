</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 Geopolitics: 'Rivals will take greater risks against the US'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No balance of power lasts forever. Just a century ago, London was the
</I>&gt;<i> centre of the world. Britain bestrode the world like a colossus and only
</I>&gt;<i> those with strong nerves (or weak judgment) dared challenge the Pax
</I>&gt;<i> Britannica.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That, of course, is all history, but the Pax Americana that has taken shape
</I>&gt;<i> since 1989 is just as vulnerable to historical change. In the 1910s, the
</I>&gt;<i> rising power and wealth of Germany and America splintered the Pax
</I>&gt;<i> Britannica; in the 2010s, east Asia will do the same to the Pax Americana.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 21st century will see technological change on an astonishing scale. It
</I>&gt;<i> may even transform what it means to be human. But in the short term ? the
</I>&gt;<i> next 20 years ? the world will still be dominated by the doings of
</I>&gt;<i> nation-states and the central issue will be the rise of the east.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By 2030, the world will be more complicated, divided between a broad
</I>&gt;<i> American sphere of influence in Europe, the Middle East and south Asia, and
</I>&gt;<i> a Chinese sphere in east Asia and Africa. Even within its own sphere, the US
</I>&gt;<i> will face new challenges from former peripheries. The large, educated
</I>&gt;<i> populations of Poland, Turkey, Brazil and their neighbours will come into
</I>&gt;<i> their own and Russia will continue&nbsp;its&nbsp;revival.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, America will probably remain the world's major power. The
</I>&gt;<i> critics who wrote off the US during the depression of the 1930s and the
</I>&gt;<i> stagflation of the 1970s lived to see it bounce back to defeat the Nazis in
</I>&gt;<i> the 1940s and the Soviets in the 1980s. America's financial problems will
</I>&gt;<i> surely deepen through the 2010s, but the 2020s could bring another Roosevelt
</I>&gt;<i> or Reagan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A hundred years ago, as Britain's dominance eroded, rivals, particularly
</I>&gt;<i> Germany, were emboldened to take ever-greater risks. The same will happen as
</I>&gt;<i> American power erodes in the 2010s-20s. In 1999, for instance, Russia would
</I>&gt;<i> never have dared attack a neighbour such as Georgia but in 2009 it took just
</I>&gt;<i> such a chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The danger of such an adventure sparking a great power war in the 2010s is
</I>&gt;<i> probably low; in the 2020s, it will be much greater.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most serious threats will arise in the vortex of instability that
</I>&gt;<i> stretches from Africa to central Asia. Most of the world's poorest people
</I>&gt;<i> live here; climate change is wreaking its worst damage here; nuclear weapons
</I>&gt;<i> are proliferating fastest here; and even in 2030, the great powers will
</I>&gt;<i> still seek much of their energy here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here, the risk of Sino-American conflict will be greatest and here the
</I>&gt;<i> balance of power will be decided.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 The UK economy: 'The popular revolt against bankers will become
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to resist'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will be a second financial crisis in the 2010s ? probably sooner than
</I>&gt;<i> later ? that will prove to be the remaking of Britain. Confronted by a
</I>&gt;<i> second trillion-pound bank bailout in less than 10 years, it will be
</I>&gt;<i> impossible for the City and wider banking system to resist reform. The
</I>&gt;<i> popular revolt against bankers, their current business model in which
</I>&gt;<i> neglect of the real economy is embedded and the scale of their bonuses ? all
</I>&gt;<i> to be underwritten by bailouts from taxpayers ? will become irresistible.
</I>&gt;<i> The consequent rebalancing of the British economy, already underway, will
</I>&gt;<i> intensify. Britain, in thrall to finance since 1945, will break free ?
</I>&gt;<i> spearheading a second Industrial Revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 2035, there is thus a good prospect that Britain will be the most
</I>&gt;<i> populous (our birth rate will be one the highest in Europe), dynamic and
</I>&gt;<i> richest European country, the key state in a reconfigured EU. Our leading
</I>&gt;<i> universities will become powerhouses of innovation, world centres in
</I>&gt;<i> exploiting the approaching avalanche of scientific and technological
</I>&gt;<i> breakthroughs. A reformed financial system will allow British entrepreneurs
</I>&gt;<i> to get the committed financial backing they need, becoming the capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> leaders in Europe. And, after a century of trying, Britain will at last
</I>&gt;<i> build itself a system for developing apprentices and technicians that is no
</I>&gt;<i> longer the Cinderella of the education system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will not be plain sailing. Massive political turbulence in China and its
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with the US will define part of the next 25 years ? and there will
</I>&gt;<i> be a period when the world trading and financial system retreats from
</I>&gt;<i> openness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How far beggar-my-neighbour competitive devaluations and protection will
</I>&gt;<i> develop is hard to predict, but protectionist trends are there for all to
</I>&gt;<i> see. Commodity prices will go much higher and there will be shortages of key
</I>&gt;<i> minerals, energy, water and some basic foodstuffs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The paradox is that this will be good news for Britain. It will force the
</I>&gt;<i> state to re-engage with the economy and to build a matrix of institutions
</I>&gt;<i> that will support innovation and investment, rather as it did between 1931
</I>&gt;<i> and 1950. New Labour began this process tremulously in its last year in
</I>&gt;<i> office; the coalition government is following through. These will be lean
</I>&gt;<i> years for the traditional Conservative right, but whether it will be a
</I>&gt;<i> liberal One Nation Tory party, ongoing coalition governments or the Labour
</I>&gt;<i> party that will be the political beneficiary is not yet sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key point is that those 20 years in the middle of the 20th century
</I>&gt;<i> witnessed great industrial creativity and an unsung economic renaissance
</I>&gt;<i> until the country fell progressively under the stultifying grip of the City
</I>&gt;<i> of London. My guess is that the same, against a similarly turbulent global
</I>&gt;<i> background, is about to happen again. My caveat is if the City remains
</I>&gt;<i> strong, in which case economic decline and social division will escalate.

</I>&gt;<i> 3 Global development: 'A vaccine will rid the world of Aids'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Within 25 years, the world will achieve many major successes in tackling
</I>&gt;<i> the diseases of the poor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, we will be polio-free and probably will have been for more than
</I>&gt;<i> a decade. The fight to eradicate polio represents one of the greatest
</I>&gt;<i> achievements in global health to date. It has mobilised millions of
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers, staged mass immunisation campaigns and helped to strengthen the
</I>&gt;<i> health systems of low-income countries. Today, we have eliminated 99% of the
</I>&gt;<i> polio in the world and eradication is well within reach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vaccines that prevent diseases such as measles and rotavirus, currently
</I>&gt;<i> available in rich countries, will also become affordable and readily
</I>&gt;<i> available in developing countries. Since it was founded 10 years ago, the
</I>&gt;<i> Gavi Alliance, a global partnership that funds expanded immunisation in poor
</I>&gt;<i> countries, has helped prevent more than 5 million deaths. It is easy to
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that in 25 years this work will have been expanded to save millions
</I>&gt;<i> more lives by making life-saving vaccines available all over the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also expect to see major strides in new areas. A rapid point-of-care
</I>&gt;<i> diagnostic test ? coupled with a faster-acting treatment regimen ? will so
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally change the way we treat tuberculosis that we can begin
</I>&gt;<i> planning an elimination campaign.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will eradicate malaria, I believe, to the point where there are no human
</I>&gt;<i> cases reported globally in 2035. We will also have effective means for
</I>&gt;<i> preventing Aids infection, including a vaccine. With the encouraging results
</I>&gt;<i> of the RV144 Aids vaccine trial in Thailand, we now know that an Aids
</I>&gt;<i> vaccine is possible. We must build on these and promising results on other
</I>&gt;<i> means of preventing HIV infection to help rid the world of the threat of
</I>&gt;<i> Aids.

</I>&gt;<i> 4 Energy: 'Returning to a world that relies on muscle power is not an
</I>&gt;<i> option'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Providing sufficient food, water and energy to allow everyone to lead
</I>&gt;<i> decent lives is an enormous challenge. Energy is a means, not an end, but a
</I>&gt;<i> necessary means. With 6.7 billion people on the planet, more than 50% living
</I>&gt;<i> in large conurbations, and these numbers expected to rise to more than 9
</I>&gt;<i> billion and 80% later in the century, returning to a world that relies on
</I>&gt;<i> human and animal muscle power is not an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The challenge is to provide sufficient energy while reducing reliance on
</I>&gt;<i> fossil fuels, which today supply 80% of our energy (in decreasing order of
</I>&gt;<i> importance, the rest comes from burning biomass and waste, hydro, nuclear
</I>&gt;<i> and, finally, other renewables, which together contribute less than 1%).
</I>&gt;<i> Reducing use of fossil fuels is necessary both to avoid serious climate
</I>&gt;<i> change and in anticipation of a time when scarcity makes them prohibitively
</I>&gt;<i> expensive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will be extremely difficult. An International Energy Agency scenario
</I>&gt;<i> that assumes the implementation of all agreed national policies and
</I>&gt;<i> announced commitments to save energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels
</I>&gt;<i> projects a 35% increase in energy consumption in the next 25 years, with
</I>&gt;<i> fossil fuels up 24%. This is almost entirely due to consumption in
</I>&gt;<i> developing countries where living standards are, happily, rising and the
</I>&gt;<i> population is increasing rapidly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This scenario, which assumes major increases in nuclear, hydro and wind
</I>&gt;<i> power, evidently does not go far enough and will break down if, as many
</I>&gt;<i> expect, oil production (which is assumed to increase 15%) peaks in much less
</I>&gt;<i> than 25 years. We need to go much further in reducing demand, through better
</I>&gt;<i> design and changes in lifestyles, increasing efficiency and improving and
</I>&gt;<i> deploying all viable alternative energy sources. It won't be cheap. And in
</I>&gt;<i> the post-fossil-fuel era it won't be sufficient without major contributions
</I>&gt;<i> from solar energy (necessitating cost reductions and improved energy storage
</I>&gt;<i> and transmission) and/or nuclear fission (meaning fast breeder and/or
</I>&gt;<i> thorium reactors when uranium eventually becomes scarce) and/or fusion
</I>&gt;<i> (which is enormously attractive in principle but won't become a reliable
</I>&gt;<i> source of energy until at least the middle of the century).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Disappointingly, with the present rate of investment in developing and
</I>&gt;<i> deploying new energy sources, the world will still be powered mainly by
</I>&gt;<i> fossil fuels in 25 years and will not be prepared to do without them.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5 Advertising: 'All sorts of things will just be sold in plain packages'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I'd been writing this five years ago, it would have been all about
</I>&gt;<i> technology: the internet, the fragmentation of media, mobile phones, social
</I>&gt;<i> tools allowing consumers to regain power at the expense of corporations, all
</I>&gt;<i> that sort of stuff. And all these things are important and will change how
</I>&gt;<i> advertising works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it's becoming clear that what'll really change advertising will be how
</I>&gt;<i> we relate to it and what we're prepared to let it do. After all, when you
</I>&gt;<i> look at advertising from the past the basic techniques haven't changed; what
</I>&gt;<i> seems startlingly alien are the attitudes it was acceptable to portray and
</I>&gt;<i> the products you were allowed to advertise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 25 years, I bet there'll be many products we'll be allowed to buy but
</I>&gt;<i> not see advertised ? the things the government will decide we shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> consuming because of their impact on healthcare costs or the environment but
</I>&gt;<i> that they can't muster the political will to ban outright. So, we'll end up
</I>&gt;<i> with all sorts of products in plain packaging with the product name in a
</I>&gt;<i> generic typeface ? as the government is currently discussing for cigarettes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it won't stop there. We'll also be nudged into renegotiating the
</I>&gt;<i> relationship between society and advertising, because over the next few
</I>&gt;<i> years we're going to be interrupted by advertising like never before. Video
</I>&gt;<i> screens are getting so cheap and disposable that they'll be plastered
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere we go. And they'll have enough intelligence and connectivity that
</I>&gt;<i> they'll see our faces, do a quick search on Facebook to find out who we are
</I>&gt;<i> and direct a message at us based on our purchasing history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least, that'll be the idea. It probably won't work very well and when it
</I>&gt;<i> does work it'll probably drive us mad. Marketing geniuses are working on
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff right now, but not all of them recognise that being allowed to do
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of thing depends on societal consent ? push the intrusion too far
</I>&gt;<i> and people will push back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Society once did a deal accepting advertising because it seemed
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally useful and interesting and because it paid for lots of
</I>&gt;<i> journalism and entertainment. It's not necessarily going to pay for those
</I>&gt;<i> things for much longer so we might start questioning whether we want to live
</I>&gt;<i> in a Blade Runner world brought to us by Cillit Bang.

</I>&gt;<i> Mather and a columnist for the magazines Campaign and Wired

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6 Neuroscience: 'We'll be able to plug information streams directly into
</I>&gt;<i> the cortex'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By 2030, we are likely to have developed no-frills brain-machine
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces, allowing the paralysed to dance in their thought-controlled
</I>&gt;<i> exoskeleton suits. I sincerely hope we will not still be interfacing with
</I>&gt;<i> computers via keyboards, one forlorn letter at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to imagine we'll have robots to do our bidding. But I predicted
</I>&gt;<i> that 20 years ago, when I was a sanguine boy leaving Star Wars, and the
</I>&gt;<i> smartest robot we have now is the Roomba vacuum cleaner. So I won't be
</I>&gt;<i> surprised if I'm wrong in another 25 years. Artificial intelligence has
</I>&gt;<i> proved itself an unexpectedly difficult problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we will understand what's happening when we immerse our heads into
</I>&gt;<i> the colourful night blender of dreams. We will have cracked the secret of
</I>&gt;<i> human memory by realising that it was never about storing things, but about
</I>&gt;<i> the relationships between things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will we have reached the singularity ? the point at which computers surpass
</I>&gt;<i> human intelligence and perhaps give us our comeuppance? We'll probably be
</I>&gt;<i> able to plug information streams directly into the cortex for those who want
</I>&gt;<i> it badly enough to risk the surgery. There will be smart drugs to enhance
</I>&gt;<i> learning and memory and a flourishing black market&nbsp;among ambitious
</I>&gt;<i> students to obtain them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having lain to rest the nature-nurture dichotomy at that point, we will
</I>&gt;<i> have a molecular understanding of the way in which cultural narratives work
</I>&gt;<i> their way into brain tissue and of individual susceptibility to those
</I>&gt;<i> stories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there's the mystery of consciousness. Will we finally have a framework
</I>&gt;<i> that allows us to translate the mechanical pieces and parts into private,
</I>&gt;<i> subjective experience? As it stands now, we don't even know what such a
</I>&gt;<i> framework could look like (&quot;carry the two here and that equals the
</I>&gt;<i> experience of tasting cinnamon&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That line of research will lead us to confront the question of whether we
</I>&gt;<i> can reproduce consciousness by replicating the exact structure of the brain
</I>&gt;<i> ? say, with zeros and ones, or beer cans and tennis balls. If this theory of
</I>&gt;<i> materialism turns out to be correct, then we will be well on our way to
</I>&gt;<i> downloading our brains into computers, allowing us to live forever in The
</I>&gt;<i> Matrix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if materialism is incorrect, that would be equally interesting: perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> brains are more like radios that receive an as-yet-undiscovered force. The
</I>&gt;<i> one thing we can be sure of is this: no matter how wacky the predictions we
</I>&gt;<i> make today, they will look tame in the strange light of the future.

</I>&gt;<i> 7 Physics: 'Within a decade, we'll know what dark matter is'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next 25 years will see fundamental advances in our understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> underlying structure of matter and of the universe. At the moment, we have
</I>&gt;<i> successful descriptions of both, but we have open questions. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> why do particles of matter have mass and what is the dark matter that
</I>&gt;<i> provides most of the matter in the universe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am optimistic that the answer to the mass question will be found within a
</I>&gt;<i> few years, whether or not it is the mythical Higgs boson, and believe that
</I>&gt;<i> the answer to the dark matter question will be found within a decade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Key roles in answering these questions will be made by experiments at
</I>&gt;<i> Cern's Large Hadron Collider, which started operations in earnest last year
</I>&gt;<i> and is expected to run for most of the next 20 years; others will be played
</I>&gt;<i> by astrophysical searches for dark matter and cosmological observations such
</I>&gt;<i> as those from the European Space Agency's Planck satellite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many theoretical proposals for answering these questions invoke new
</I>&gt;<i> principles in physics, such as the existence of additional dimensions of
</I>&gt;<i> space or a &quot;supersymmetry&quot; between the constituents of matter and the forces
</I>&gt;<i> between them, and we will discover whether these ideas are useful for
</I>&gt;<i> physics. Both these ideas play roles in string theory, the best guess we
</I>&gt;<i> have for a complete theory of all the fundamental forces including gravity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will string theory be pinned down within 20 years? My crystal ball is
</I>&gt;<i> cloudy on this point, but I am sure that we physicists will have an exciting
</I>&gt;<i> time trying to find out.

</I>&gt;<i> 8 Food: 'Russia will become a global food superpower'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When experts talk about the coming food security crisis, the date they
</I>&gt;<i> fixate upon is 2030. By then, our numbers will be nudging 9 billion and we
</I>&gt;<i> will need to be producing 50% more food than we are now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the middle of that decade, therefore, we will either all be starving,
</I>&gt;<i> and fighting wars over resources, or our global food supply will have
</I>&gt;<i> changed radically. The bitter reality is that it will probably be a mixture
</I>&gt;<i> of both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Developed countries such as the UK are likely, for the most part, to have
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to pull up the drawbridge, increasing national production and
</I>&gt;<i> reducing our reliance on imports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In response to increasing prices, some of us may well have reduced our
</I>&gt;<i> consumption of meat, the raising of which is a notoriously inefficient use
</I>&gt;<i> of grain. This will probably create a food underclass, surviving on a carb-
</I>&gt;<i> and fat-heavy diet, while those with money scarf the protein.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The developing world, meanwhile, will work to bridge the food gap by
</I>&gt;<i> embracing the promise of biotechnology which the middle classes in the
</I>&gt;<i> developed world will have assumed that they had the luxury to reject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In truth, any of the imported grain that we do consume will come from
</I>&gt;<i> genetically modified crops. As climate change lays waste to the productive
</I>&gt;<i> fields of southern Europe and north Africa, more water-efficient strains of
</I>&gt;<i> corn, wheat and barley will be pressed into service; likewise, to the north,
</I>&gt;<i> Russia will become a global food superpower as the same climate change opens
</I>&gt;<i> up the once frozen and massive Siberian prairie to food production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The consensus now is that the planet does have the wherewithal to feed that
</I>&gt;<i> huge number of people. It's just that some people in the west may find the
</I>&gt;<i> methods used to do so unappetising.

</I>&gt;<i> 9 Nanotechnology: 'Privacy will be a quaint obsession'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twenty years ago, Don Eigler, a scientist working for IBM in California,
</I>&gt;<i> wrote out the logo of his employer in letters made of individual atoms. This
</I>&gt;<i> feat was a graphic symbol of the potential of the new field of
</I>&gt;<i> nanotechnology, which promises to rebuild matter atom by atom, molecule by
</I>&gt;<i> molecule, and to give us unprecedented power over the material world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some, like the futurist Ray Kurzweil, predict that nanotechnology will lead
</I>&gt;<i> to a revolution, allowing us to make any kind of product for virtually
</I>&gt;<i> nothing; to have computers so powerful that they will surpass human
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence; and to lead to a new kind of medicine on a sub-cellular level
</I>&gt;<i> that will allow us to abolish ageing and death.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that Kurzweil's &quot;technological singularity&quot; ? a dream of
</I>&gt;<i> scientific transcendence that echoes older visions of religious apocalypse ?
</I>&gt;<i> will happen. Some stubborn physics stands between us and &quot;the rapture of the
</I>&gt;<i> nerds&quot;. But nanotechnology will lead to some genuinely transformative
</I>&gt;<i> applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New ways of making solar cells very cheaply on a very large scale offer us
</I>&gt;<i> the best hope we have for providing low-carbon energy on a big enough scale
</I>&gt;<i> to satisfy the needs of a growing world population aspiring to the
</I>&gt;<i> prosperity we're used to in the developed world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll learn more about intervening in our biology at the sub-cellular level
</I>&gt;<i> and this nano-medicine will give us new hope of overcoming really difficult
</I>&gt;<i> and intractable diseases, such as Alzheimer's, that will increasingly
</I>&gt;<i> afflict our population as it ages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The information technology that drives your mobile phone or laptop is
</I>&gt;<i> already operating at the nanoscale. Another 25 years of development will
</I>&gt;<i> lead us to a new world of cheap and ubiquitous computing, in which privacy
</I>&gt;<i> will be a quaint obsession of our grandparents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nanotechnology is a different type of science, respecting none of the
</I>&gt;<i> conventional boundaries between disciplines and unashamedly focused on
</I>&gt;<i> applications rather than fundamental understanding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the huge resources being directed towards nanotechnology in China and
</I>&gt;<i> its neighbours, this may also be the first major technology of the modern
</I>&gt;<i> era that is predominantly developed outside the US and Europe.

</I>&gt;<i> 10 Gaming: 'We'll play games to solve problems'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last decade, in the US and Europe but particularly in south-east
</I>&gt;<i> Asia, we have witnessed a flight into virtual worlds, with people playing
</I>&gt;<i> games such as Second Life. But over the course of the next 25 years, that
</I>&gt;<i> flight will be successfully reversed, not because we're going to spend less
</I>&gt;<i> time playing games, but because games and virtual worlds are going to become
</I>&gt;<i> more closely connected to reality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There will be games where the action is influenced by what happens in
</I>&gt;<i> reality; and there will be games that use sensors so that we can play them
</I>&gt;<i> out in the real world ? a game in which your avatar is your dog, which wears
</I>&gt;<i> a game collar that measures how fast it's running and whether or not it's
</I>&gt;<i> wagging its tail, for example, where you play with your dog to advance the
</I>&gt;<i> narrative, as opposed to playing with a virtual character. I can imagine
</I>&gt;<i> more physical activity games, too, and these might be used to harness energy
</I>&gt;<i> ? peripherals like a dance pad that actually captures energy from your
</I>&gt;<i> dancing on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there will be problem-solving games: there are already a lot of games
</I>&gt;<i> in which scientists try to teach gamers real science ? how to build proteins
</I>&gt;<i> to cure cancer, for example. One surprising trend in gaming is that gamers
</I>&gt;<i> today prefer, on average, three to one to play co-operative games rather
</I>&gt;<i> than competitive games. Now, this is really interesting; if you think about
</I>&gt;<i> the history of games, there really weren't co-operative games until this
</I>&gt;<i> latest generation of video games. In every game you can think of ? card
</I>&gt;<i> games, chess, sport ? everybody plays to win. But now we'll see increasing
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration, people playing games together to solve problems while they're
</I>&gt;<i> enjoying themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also studies on how games work on our minds and our cognitive
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities, and a lot of science suggests you can use games to treat
</I>&gt;<i> depression, anxiety and attention-deficit disorder. Making games that are
</I>&gt;<i> both fun and serve a social purpose isn't easy ? a lot of innovation will be
</I>&gt;<i> required ? but gaming will become increasingly integrated into society.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The open web created by idealist geeks, hippies and academics, who believed
</I>&gt;<i> in the free and generative flow of knowledge, is being overrun by a web that
</I>&gt;<i> is safer, more controlled and commercial, created by problem-solving

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook and Apple are spawning cloud capitalism, in which consumers allow
</I>&gt;<i> companies to manage information, media, ideas, money, software, tools and
</I>&gt;<i> preferences on their behalf, holding everything in vast, floating clouds of

</I>&gt;<i> mainstream force. If, however, it becomes little more than a guerrilla
</I>&gt;<i> campaign, then the open web could be pushed to the margins, along with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By 2035, the web, as a single space largely made up of webpages accessed on

</I>&gt;<i> be sharing videos, simulations, experiences and environments, on a
</I>&gt;<i> multiplicity of devices to which we'll pay as much attention as a light
</I>&gt;<i> switch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, many of the big changes of the next 25 years will come from unknowns
</I>&gt;<i> working in their bedrooms and garages. And by 2035 we will be talking about

</I>&gt;<i> 12 Fashion: 'Technology creates smarter clothes'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fashion is such an important part of the way in which we communicate our
</I>&gt;<i> identity to others, and for a very long time it's meant dress: the textile
</I>&gt;<i> garments on our body. But in the coming decades, I think there'll be much
</I>&gt;<i> more emphasis on other manifestations of fashion and different ways of
</I>&gt;<i> communicating with each other, different ways of creating a sense of
</I>&gt;<i> belonging and of making us feel great about ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're already designing our identities online ? manipulating imagery to
</I>&gt;<i> tell a story about ourselves. Instead of meeting in the street or in a bar
</I>&gt;<i> and having a conversation and looking at what each other is wearing, we're
</I>&gt;<i> communicating in some depth through these new channels. With clothing, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's possible that we'll see a polarisation between items that are
</I>&gt;<i> very practical and those that are very much about display ? and maybe these
</I>&gt;<i> are not things that you own but that you borrow or share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technology is already being used to create clothing that fits better and is
</I>&gt;<i> smarter; it is able to transmit a degree of information back to you. This is
</I>&gt;<i> partly driven by customer demand and the desire to know where clothing comes
</I>&gt;<i> from ? so we'll see tags on garments that tell you where every part of it
</I>&gt;<i> was made, and some of this, I suspect, will be legislation-driven, too, for
</I>&gt;<i> similar reasons, particularly as resources become scarcer and it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly important to recognise water and carbon footprints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it's not simply an issue of functionality. Fashion's gone through
</I>&gt;<i> a big cycle in the last 25 years ? from being something that was treasured
</I>&gt;<i> and cherished to being something that felt disposable, because of a drop in
</I>&gt;<i> prices. In fact, we've completely changed our relationship towards clothes
</I>&gt;<i> and there's a real feeling among designers who I work with that they're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to work back into their designs an element of emotional content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there's definitely a place for technology in creating a dialogue
</I>&gt;<i> with you through your clothes.

</I>&gt;<i> 13 Nature: 'We'll redefine the wild'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We all want to live in a world where species such as tigers, the great
</I>&gt;<i> whales, orchids and coral reefs can persist and thrive and I am sure that
</I>&gt;<i> the commitment that people have to maintaining the spectacle and diversity
</I>&gt;<i> of life will continue. Over the past 50 years or so, there has been growing
</I>&gt;<i> support for nature conservation. When we understand the causes of species
</I>&gt;<i> losses, good conservation actions can and do reverse the trends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is going to become much harder. The human population has roughly
</I>&gt;<i> doubled since the 1960s and will increase by another third by 2030. Demands
</I>&gt;<i> for food, water and energy will increase, inevitably in competition with
</I>&gt;<i> other species. People already use up to 40% of the world's primary
</I>&gt;<i> production (energy) and this must increase, with important consequences for
</I>&gt;<i> nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the UK, some familiar species will become scarcer as our rare habitats
</I>&gt;<i> (mires, bogs and moorlands) are lost. We will be seeing the effects from
</I>&gt;<i> gradual warming that will allow more continental species to live here, and
</I>&gt;<i> in our towns and cities we'll probably have more species that have become
</I>&gt;<i> adapted to living alongside people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can conserve species when we really try, so I'm confident that the
</I>&gt;<i> charismatic mega fauna and flora will mostly still persist in 2035, but they
</I>&gt;<i> will be increasingly restricted to highly managed and protected areas. The
</I>&gt;<i> survivors will be those that cope well with people and those we care about
</I>&gt;<i> enough to save. Increasingly, we won't be living as a part of nature but
</I>&gt;<i> alongside it, and we'll have redefined what we mean by the wild and
</I>&gt;<i> wilderness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Crucially, we are still rapidly losing overall biodiversity, including soil
</I>&gt;<i> micro-organisms, plankton in the oceans, pollinators and the remaining
</I>&gt;<i> tropical and temperate forests. These underpin productive soils, clean
</I>&gt;<i> water, climate regulation and disease-resistance. We take these vital
</I>&gt;<i> services from biodiversity and ecosystems for granted, treat them recklessly
</I>&gt;<i> and don't include them in any kind of national accounting.

</I>&gt;<i> 14 Architecture: What constitutes a 'city' will change
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 2035, most of humanity will live in favelas. This will not be entirely
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful, as many people will live in very poor housing, but it will have
</I>&gt;<i> its good side. It will mean that cities will consist of series of small
</I>&gt;<i> units organised, at best, by the people who know what is best for themselves
</I>&gt;<i> and, at worst, by local crime bosses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cities will be too big and complex for any single power to understand and
</I>&gt;<i> manage them. They already are, in fact. The word &quot;city&quot; will lose some of
</I>&gt;<i> its meaning: it will make less and less sense to describe agglomerations of
</I>&gt;<i> tens of millions of people as if they were one place, with one identity. If
</I>&gt;<i> current dreams of urban agriculture come true, the distinction between town
</I>&gt;<i> and country will blur. Attempts at control won't be abandoned, however,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that strange bubbles of luxury will appear, like shopping malls and
</I>&gt;<i> office parks. To be optimistic, the human genius for inventing social
</I>&gt;<i> structures will mean that new forms of settlement we can't quite imagine
</I>&gt;<i> will begin to emerge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All this assumes that environmental catastrophe doesn't drive us into
</I>&gt;<i> caves. Nor does it describe what will happen in Britain, with a roughly
</I>&gt;<i> stable population and a planning policy dedicated to preserving the status
</I>&gt;<i> quo as much as possible. Britain in 25 years' time may look much as it does

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sport will have to respond to new technologies, the speed at which we
</I>&gt;<i> process information and apparent reductions in attention span. Shorter
</I>&gt;<i> formats, such as Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens, could aid the
</I>&gt;<i> development of traditional sports in new territories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The demands of TV will grow, as will technology's role in umpiring and

</I>&gt;<i> live holograms. I don't think we'll see an acceptance of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not difficult to predict how our transport infrastructure will look in
</I>&gt;<i> 25 years' time ? it can take decades to construct a high-speed rail line or
</I>&gt;<i> a motorway, so we know now what's in store. But there will be radical
</I>&gt;<i> changes in how we think about transport. The technology of information and
</I>&gt;<i> communication networks is changing rapidly and internet and mobile
</I>&gt;<i> developments are helping make our journeys more seamless. Queues at St
</I>&gt;<i> Pancras station or Heathrow airport when the infrastructure can't cope for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason should become a thing of the past, but these challenges,
</I>&gt;<i> while they might appear trivial, are significant because it's not easy to
</I>&gt;<i> organise large-scale information systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The instinct to travel is innate within us, but we will have to do it in a
</I>&gt;<i> more carbon-efficient way. It's hard to be precise, but I think we'll be
</I>&gt;<i> cycling and walking more; in crowded urban areas we may see travelators ?
</I>&gt;<i> which we see in airports already ? and more scooters. There will be more
</I>&gt;<i> automated cars, like the ones Google has recently been testing. These
</I>&gt;<i> driverless cars will be safer, but when accidents do happen, they may be on
</I>&gt;<i> the scale of airline disasters. Personal jetpacks will, I think, remain a

</I>&gt;<i> 17 Health: 'We'll feel less healthy'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Health systems are generally quite conservative. That's why the more
</I>&gt;<i> radical forecasts of the recent past haven't quite materialised. Contrary to
</I>&gt;<i> past predictions, we don't carry smart cards packed with health data; most
</I>&gt;<i> treatments aren't genetically tailored; and health tourism to Bangalore
</I>&gt;<i> remains low. But for all that, health is set to undergo a slow but steady
</I>&gt;<i> revolution. Life expectancy is rising about three months each year, but
</I>&gt;<i> we'll feel less healthy, partly because we'll be more aware of the many
</I>&gt;<i> things that are, or could be, going wrong, and partly because more of us
</I>&gt;<i> will be living with a long-term condition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll spend more on health but also want stronger action to influence
</I>&gt;<i> health. The US Congressional Budget Office forecasts that US health spending
</I>&gt;<i> will rise from 17% of the economy today to 25% in 2025 and 49% in 2082.
</I>&gt;<i> Their forecasts may be designed to shock but they contain an important grain
</I>&gt;<i> of truth. Spending on health and jobs in health is bound to grow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of that spending will go on the problems of prosperity ? obesity,
</I>&gt;<i> alcohol consumption and injuries from extreme sports. Currently fashionable
</I>&gt;<i> ideas of &quot;nudge&quot; will have turned out to be far too weak to change
</I>&gt;<i> behaviours. Instead, we'll be more in the realms of &quot;shove&quot; and &quot;push&quot;, with
</I>&gt;<i> cities trying to reshape whole environments to encourage people to walk and
</I>&gt;<i> cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By 2030, mental health may at last be treated on a par with physical
</I>&gt;<i> health. Medicine may have found smart drugs for some conditions but the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest impact may be achieved from lower-tech actions, such as meditation
</I>&gt;<i> in schools or brain gyms for pensioners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Healthcare will look more like education. Your GP will prescribe you a
</I>&gt;<i> short course on managing your diabetes or heart condition, and when you get
</I>&gt;<i> home there'll be an e-tutor to help you and a vast array of information
</I>&gt;<i> about your condition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Almost every serious observer of health systems believes that the great
</I>&gt;<i> general hospitals are already anachronistic, but because hospitals are where
</I>&gt;<i> so much of the power lies, and so much of the public attachment, it would be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the next two and a half decades, it is quite possible that those Brits
</I>&gt;<i> who follow a religion will continue both to fall in number and also become
</I>&gt;<i> more orthodox or fundamentalist. Similarly, organised religions will
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly work together to counter what they see as greater threats to
</I>&gt;<i> their interests ? creeping agnosticism and secularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another 10 years of failure by the Anglican church to face down the
</I>&gt;<i> African-led traditionalists over women bishops and gay clerics could open
</I>&gt;<i> the question of disestablishment of the Church of England. The country's
</I>&gt;<i> politicians, including an increasingly gay-friendly Tory party, may find it
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to see how state institutions can continue to be associated with
</I>&gt;<i> an image of sexism and homophobia.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I predict an increase in debate around the tension between a secular agenda
</I>&gt;<i> which says it is merely seeking to remove religious privilege, end
</I>&gt;<i> discrimination and separate church and state, and organised orthodox
</I>&gt;<i> religion which counterclaims that this would amount to driving religious
</I>&gt;<i> voices from the public square.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Despite two of the three party leaders being professed atheists, the
</I>&gt;<i> secular tendency in this country still flatters to deceive. There is, at
</I>&gt;<i> present, no organised, non-religious, rationalist movement. In contrast, the

</I>&gt;<i> The theatre will weather the recent cuts. Some companies will close and the

</I>&gt;<i> more politicised generation of theatre artists. We will see old forms from
</I>&gt;<i> the 1960s re-emerge (like agit prop) and new forms will be generated to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate ideology and politics.

</I>&gt;<i> exciting possibilities of web-native literature, stories that really exploit
</I>&gt;<i> the fractal, hypertextual way we use the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that, in 2035, stories will be ubiquitous. There'll be a
</I>&gt;<i> tube-based soap opera to tune your iPod to during your commute, a tale
</I>&gt;<i> (incorporating on-sale brands) to enjoy via augmented reality in the
</I>&gt;<i> supermarket. Your employer will bribe you with stories to focus on your job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most won't be great, but then most of everything isn't great ? and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually there'll be a Twitter-based classic.
