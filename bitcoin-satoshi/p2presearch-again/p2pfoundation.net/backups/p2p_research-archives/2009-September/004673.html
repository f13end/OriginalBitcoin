<PRE>Hi Paul,

yes indeed, there is a world of difference between automating some research
steps, and obsoleting human research and meaning-making altogether ..

</I>&gt;<i> I agree with most of your points and concerns here. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Some tangentially related points.

</I>&gt;<i> Even within subspecialities, it can be hard to keep up on all the
</I>&gt;<i> exponentially emerging technologies out there right now. It is way harder
</I>&gt;<i> for a generalist to know what is possible and ongoing in a field. So, we are
</I>&gt;<i> all working from a disadvantage on what is available now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, there are some issues where there may be active disinformation (like
</I>&gt;<i> anti-solar FUD by the fossil fuel and nuclear industries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And now for some extended comments on this trend for automating research
</I>&gt;<i> (as well as changing the nature how it is dose in other ways):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a robot that does its own research, in the sense that is asks the
</I>&gt;<i> questions within a limited domain, as opposed to the easier task of just
</I>&gt;<i> answering questions that Nathan pointed to.  You're right the system that
</I>&gt;<i> Nathan cites (one from IBM answering Jeapordy trivia questions) is not
</I>&gt;<i> putting scientists is much danger. :-)  But, this other system has the
</I>&gt;<i> potential to make at least some post-docs nervous, perhaps, in the sense
</I>&gt;<i> that it amplifies what just one scientist do:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Video: A Robot That Conducts Its Own Research&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-04/video-robot-conducts-its-own-research">http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-04/video-robot-conducts-its-own-research</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I've always said that most of what I did as a biology research technician
</I>&gt;<i> would someday be carried out by a robot or well-trained monkey. Most lab
</I>&gt;<i> work involves tasks just begging for a robotic hand: repetitive, technical,
</I>&gt;<i> and exceptionally boring. Some (very well-funded) labs have robots that can
</I>&gt;<i> perform repetitive physical jobs, like screening gazillions of chemicals for
</I>&gt;<i> ones that will be medically useful. But this new robot can do the fun part
</I>&gt;<i> of science, too -- the thinking. Meet Adam, the first robot that has
</I>&gt;<i> independently brought a little nugget of experimental knowledge to the
</I>&gt;<i> world. Adam thought up a hypothesis, tested in the real world, analyzed the
</I>&gt;<i> data, and then, of course, did it all over again, many, many times.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with the destruction of the low end manufacturing industry in the USA
</I>&gt;<i> and offshoring more and more stuff to China, when you remove the on ramps or
</I>&gt;<i> first steps at the low end of something (gradually increasing in what you
</I>&gt;<i> replace, like China has gone from cheap toys to all sorts of gadgetry now,
</I>&gt;<i> same as Japan did decades earlier), there is less of a chance for as many
</I>&gt;<i> new people to learn and move into an industry. This robot above does what
</I>&gt;<i> post-docs I knew were doing in the 1990s for most of their day. So, it
</I>&gt;<i> essentially is removing the first rungs of the scientist career ladder in an
</I>&gt;<i> area. Science is supposed to be more than rote stuff, but in practice, the
</I>&gt;<i> way academia is set up as a pecking order, that's the way it is for most
</I>&gt;<i> early career researchers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I think that is a good thing in general to automate such work, because
</I>&gt;<i> those biochemicals can be nasty, and post-docs are routinely exploited as
</I>&gt;<i> cheap labor in the biology field. But, is it better to be exploited as well
</I>&gt;<i> as get cancer in twenty years, or is it better to be unemployed with huge
</I>&gt;<i> student loans you can not repay? These sorts of robots are potentially a big
</I>&gt;<i> issue that will more and more affect biotech research. They may mean less
</I>&gt;<i> and less first step opportunities or any employment of many people getting
</I>&gt;<i> biology-related PhDs, considering there is already a glut of them relative
</I>&gt;<i> to the opportunities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computer software and simulation by itself has the same potential, with
</I>&gt;<i> computers looking at lots of simulated possibilities. In that sense, senior
</I>&gt;<i> engineers are also being amplified while at the same time junior engineers
</I>&gt;<i> are replaced to an extent. Again, that is good in one sense, but bad in
</I>&gt;<i> another in a scarcity oriented society where you are either employed or
</I>&gt;<i> destitute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, one may point to lots of counter examples, but it seems there is the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of a trend here.  The real issue is, if you have a fixed amount of
</I>&gt;<i> money as a researcher, how much do you want to spend on people and how much
</I>&gt;<i> on machines (robots or fancy computers)? That has always been an issue, but
</I>&gt;<i> as the machines get more capable, the balance may be shifting to more
</I>&gt;<i> technology per researcher. So, a robot like this might not remove the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Principal Investigator&quot; anytime soon, but it might obsolete much of the
</I>&gt;<i> supporting PhD staff. That would be a good thing to remove the drudgery if
</I>&gt;<i> there was not essentially a limited supply of funds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, here is why the academic pyramid scheme has failed already,
</I>&gt;<i> even without the robots which just make all this even worse from the
</I>&gt;<i> point-of-view of the would-be researcher starting out:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The Big Crunch&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/crunch_art.html<http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/crunch_art.html">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/crunch_art.html&lt;http://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Edg/crunch_art.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, there is stuff going on, but again, it is not to the point where
</I>&gt;<i> researchers are all being replaced today. But clearly, they are starting to
</I>&gt;<i> be under pressure. And that is sad, because many people want to do research
</I>&gt;<i> and never get the chance. And researchers often don't cost much money to
</I>&gt;<i> feed (although equipment and lab space can add up in some areas). It is sad
</I>&gt;<i> if our society can not accommodate everyone that wants to make a research
</I>&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The more general issue is that while everything you say is right about
</I>&gt;<i> being clear on issues of imagination, dream, and reality, one does need to
</I>&gt;<i> be clear on trends, too. :-) And as with that &quot;big crunch&quot; essay above
</I>&gt;<i> written by the Vice Provost of Caltech, sometimes trends are not obvious to
</I>&gt;<i> look at until many years after you are living in the implications of them
</I>&gt;<i> (in that case, it was the end of most academic growth in the 1970s for the
</I>&gt;<i> USA while production of PhDs in vast quantities continued, a fact that
</I>&gt;<i> thirty years later academia still refuses to acknowledge or deal with). Even
</I>&gt;<i> ten years ago, it was known the &quot;half-life&quot; of a science PhD was less than a
</I>&gt;<i> decade:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Careers close to critical mass&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=107362&amp;sectioncode=26">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=107362&amp;sectioncode=26</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What does a scientist's career have in common with a radioactive element
</I>&gt;<i> like tritium? They both have a half-life that is measured in years, not
</I>&gt;<i> decades. In the case of tritium, it has a half-life of just over 12 years,
</I>&gt;<i> but the &quot;career half-life&quot; of the typical biomedical scientist may be only
</I>&gt;<i> half as long. The half-life of tritium is how long it takes before 50 per
</I>&gt;<i> cent of the atoms have decomposed, but in the case of a group of scientists,
</I>&gt;<i> their career half-life is how long it takes before half of them have left
</I>&gt;<i> the profession, which may be as little as six years. Lawyers and doctors, on
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand, can generally look forward to a career that lasts until
</I>&gt;<i> retirement.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, add automation to that situation, and we may well be seeing the end of
</I>&gt;<i> entire areas of research in academia done by PhDs and post-docs, at least in
</I>&gt;<i> some areas of biochemistry, given the machines are cheaper and they have not
</I>&gt;<i> yet unionized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, I'd point out, the sciences were considered the *good* and *safe*
</I>&gt;<i> PhDs:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Wanted: Really Smart Suckers: Grad school provides exciting new road to
</I>&gt;<i> poverty&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-20/news/wanted-really-smart-suckers/">http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-20/news/wanted-really-smart-suckers/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Here's an exciting career opportunity you won't see in the classified ads.
</I>&gt;<i> For the first six to 10 years, it pays less than $20,000 and demands
</I>&gt;<i> superhuman levels of commitment in a Dickensian environment. Forget about
</I>&gt;<i> marriage, a mortgage, or even Thanksgiving dinners, as the focus of your
</I>&gt;<i> entire life narrows to the production, to exacting specifications, of a
</I>&gt;<i> 300-page document less than a dozen people will read. Then it's time for
</I>&gt;<i> advancement: Apply to 50 far-flung, undesirable locations, with a 30 to 40
</I>&gt;<i> percent chance of being offered any position at all. You may end up living
</I>&gt;<i> 100 miles from your spouse and commuting to three different work locations a
</I>&gt;<i> week. You may end up $50,000 in debt, with no health insurance, feeding your
</I>&gt;<i> kids with food stamps. If you are the luckiest out of every five entrants,
</I>&gt;<i> you may win the profession's ultimate prize: A comfortable middle-class job,
</I>&gt;<i> for the rest of your life, with summers off. Welcome to the world of the
</I>&gt;<i> humanities Ph.D. student, 2004, where promises mean little and revolt is in
</I>&gt;<i> the air. In the past week, Columbia's graduate teaching assistants went on
</I>&gt;<i> strike and temporary, or adjunct, faculty at New York University narrowly
</I>&gt;<i> avoided one. Columbia's Graduate Student Employees United seeks recognition,
</I>&gt;<i> over the administration's appeals, of a two-year-old vote that would make it
</I>&gt;<i> the second officially recognized union at a private university. NYU's
</I>&gt;<i> adjuncts, who won their union in 2002, reached an eleventh-hour agreement
</I>&gt;<i> for health care and office space, among other amenities. Grad students have
</I>&gt;<i> always resigned themselves to relative poverty in anticipation of a cushy,
</I>&gt;<i> tenured payoff. But in the past decade, the rules of the game have changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Budget pressures have spurred universities' increasing dependence on
</I>&gt;<i> so-called &quot;casual labor,&quot; which damages both the working conditions of
</I>&gt;<i> graduate students and their job prospects. Over half of the classroom time
</I>&gt;<i> at major universities is now logged by non-tenure-track teachers, both
</I>&gt;<i> graduate teaching assistants&#8212;known as TAs&#8212;and adjuncts. At community
</I>&gt;<i> colleges, part-timers make up 60 percent of the faculties.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, computers have the potential to automate the humanities PhD
</I>&gt;<i> student's work as well. I say &quot;work&quot; in the sense of what PhDs are generally
</I>&gt;<i> paid to do as research assistants, teaching assistants, and lab assistants,
</I>&gt;<i> not &quot;work&quot; as in what they love to do in their own original research for a
</I>&gt;<i> PhD thesis or whatever. So, computers make it easier for existing
</I>&gt;<i> professorts to grade assignments, search for references, write letters,
</I>&gt;<i> check for plagiarism, and so on, thus eliminating the need for most of the
</I>&gt;<i> jobs that humanities PhDs have been paid to do (not to mention many academic
</I>&gt;<i> secretaries). Obviously, I feel it is wonderful that a humanities PhD
</I>&gt;<i> student talks about things like literature with undergrads, discusses the
</I>&gt;<i> meanings in life and all that, and does original research -- but in an age
</I>&gt;<i> of tightening budgets and a glut of people with PhDs and lots of computers,
</I>&gt;<i> there is pressure to cut what can be cut, and grad students are historically
</I>&gt;<i> the weakest players. Not to mention other pressures on them:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.disciplined-minds.com/">http://www.disciplined-minds.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I predict we see more and more automation in those humanities areas, since
</I>&gt;<i> computers are getting better and better at analyzing rote text. Example of
</I>&gt;<i> just the beginning of replacing humanities PhDs:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Professor Develops Essay Grading Software&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/05/09/professor-develops-essay-grading-software">http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/05/09/professor-develops-essay-grading-software</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ed Brent, University of Missouri professor of sociology invested six years
</I>&gt;<i> into developing Qualrus, using the last two years to test it on his
</I>&gt;<i> students. Brent said the program is sophisticated enough to analyze sentence
</I>&gt;<i> and paragraph structure and is able to judge the flow or arguments and
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. Keywords and concepts are pre-entered by the teacher. Students can
</I>&gt;<i> upload their papers on the Internet and receive instant feedback and scores.
</I>&gt;<i> Numeric scores are based on whether the writer addressed the most important
</I>&gt;<i> elements of the assignment. The idea is to save teachers the tedium of
</I>&gt;<i> reading scores of essays on the same topic. According to Brent, he himself
</I>&gt;<i> has shaved off 200 hours of paper grading.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, I'm not saying you can replace a humanities professor with that. But
</I>&gt;<i> you can replace the first career steps to become a humanities professor with
</I>&gt;<i> that, and the net effect may ultimately be the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already faculty are graying. In the same way automation lets old Japanese
</I>&gt;<i> keep from importing young foreigners to help them, graying faculty may turn
</I>&gt;<i> to automation instead of new hires to hang on to their jobs:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Graying of US academia stirs debate: Some cite brilliance; others see lost
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity in hiring&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/12/27/graying_of_us_academia_stirs_debate/">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/12/27/graying_of_us_academia_stirs_debate/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> This year, 9.2 percent of tenured professors in Harvard's Faculty of Arts
</I>&gt;<i> and Sciences are 70 or older, compared with none in 1992. Other universities
</I>&gt;<i> have seen jumps in the percentage of older professors, although the actual
</I>&gt;<i> number remains small on many campuses. The graying of university faculty has
</I>&gt;<i> stirred vigorous debate. Some in higher education, including Glauber's
</I>&gt;<i> students, say many older professors are brilliant researchers and riveting
</I>&gt;<i> teachers with plenty to offer. But some academic leaders say the abundance
</I>&gt;<i> of older professors is plugging the pipeline, making it harder to hire young
</I>&gt;<i> faculty members and bring fresh ideas into labs and the classroom. At the
</I>&gt;<i> worst, they worry that the perseverance of older professors will crowd the
</I>&gt;<i> young out of scholarly professions altogether. ... The slower pace of
</I>&gt;<i> retirements in the sciences is one of the reasons that young scientists are
</I>&gt;<i> spending more years in low-paid postdoctoral fellowships and the average age
</I>&gt;<i> for a scientist to get his or her first major research grants from the
</I>&gt;<i> National Institutes of Health has risen from 37 to 42 in the last 25 years.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in a way, this is even a &quot;transhumanism&quot; issue, as old professors with
</I>&gt;<i> tenure and relative affluence are turning themselves into transhumans with
</I>&gt;<i> computers, Borg-like collaborative social networks, hearing aids, glasses,
</I>&gt;<i> and insulin shots, and with all that augmenting technology they are crowding
</I>&gt;<i> out the young and poor would-be professors who just can't compete. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Add robots that do their own research and paper-grading computer AI
</I>&gt;<i> software programs into this mix, things that will mainly be only available
</I>&gt;<i> to the old and relatively wealthy professors who are already established,
</I>&gt;<i> and who knows what will be happening soon to grad students? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, all that is one thing driving the Pro-Am revolution:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_amateurs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_amateurs</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As well as the &quot;Blue Collar&quot; scholar:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://unconventionalideas.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/blue-collar-independent-scholar/">http://unconventionalideas.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/blue-collar-independent-scholar/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;People with scholarly interests should take a long hard look at the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of a blue collar career. On the surface this may sound
</I>&gt;<i> ludicrous, but I&#8217;ve found blue collar work actually enables me to pursue
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual interests far more than any white collar job I ever had. Here&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> how it all happened:.. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, perhaps, in my case, doing child-care part of the time for my child
</I>&gt;<i> while also writing stuff and programming free software, I guess that makes
</I>&gt;<i> me a &quot;Pink Collar&quot; scholar. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink-collar_worker">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink-collar_worker</A>
</I>&gt;<i> At least for a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I think there are plenty of resources on our planet to allow anyone
</I>&gt;<i> of any age to be a researcher or professor, so I don't think the solution is
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory retirement. It's a basic income, rethinking education vs.
</I>&gt;<i> schooling, massively increased R&amp;D spending by government, and things like
</I>&gt;<i> that, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, there are actually several trends that are changing the nature of
</I>&gt;<i> academic research as we know it. :-) And peer-to-peer, in part bypassing the
</I>&gt;<i> academic journal system (like this mailing list), is fueling some of them.
</I>&gt;<i> As is automation. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is all not to disagree with your general point. You are right
</I>&gt;<i> to call for clarity about what categories ideas and information fall into.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> surely want to destroy everyone else in some way; we're better than that;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we're smarter than that!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So put the appropriate political exchange trade economies in practice to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simple hand tool craft production if you so please) and distribution

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> produce the outcome and if we have the people to meet those requirements.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> am now working on that document with those I know or know someone else
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knows how to accomplish these tasks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To better express the link between exchange trade and production
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> progression, here's a working model to debate and elaborate:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Urban. 50% of the global population. Toward post-scarcity with exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trade as needed, but reduced with each phase.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   - we know what mass production picture looks like, factory workers are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   obsolete and we must admit this and information workers are being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> replaced
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   with software. Not enough people are able to afford the goods so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> capital
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   collapses whether demand exists for the  &gt;&gt; product or outcome
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   - flexible mass production &gt;&gt; a few techs to ensure designs created by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   the user match the robots used to assemble a variety &gt;&gt; with few jobs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   high paying positions, but mostly many jobs that do not pay enough,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   populations with this production formula are issued a basic income to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pay
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   for goods if they cannot be made personally for free &gt;&gt; product or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> outcome
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Post-scarcity is achieved
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   - Digitally/robotically personal production enabling the freedom to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   return to simple hand tool craft production if you so please &gt;&gt; product
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   outcome
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The assumptions I've stated mean I am a technological advocate, but I do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not agree that technology in itself will fruit the production phases I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> presented without guidance or self determination. The outcomes presented
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> require the tact of social science integrated with the study in applied
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> technology and will require an interest in how things work and an desire
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> make the things that work to secure the paths I have presented. I am
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my best to become a person of such sorts, but I admit I still have a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hangover from the consumer culture that surfaced me. I may well be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considered insane; as my beliefs do not reflect or address with much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> interest the present &quot;reality,&quot; but the 'reality' I would rather live
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whether practices can meet these requirements or not. I'm stubborn and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of us need to be in this regard.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am a technological determinist in the sense that based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> presented by Kurzweil in 'The Singularity is Near', it presents various
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> technology developments, showing that when our tools are accessed by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> computers or communications channels, people can see them and then work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> develop them further, and in so doing, the 'deposit' remains and grows
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exponentially, and that this can be shown on a variety of charts as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happening before for sometime, and we call the human deposit that is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> made,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'technology'. If it happened before for hundreds of years along with a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variety of others things we can expect many of these things to continue
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> develop exponentially regardless of our individual behaviors. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the pitfalls of extrapolation as I will address.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I rarely, if at all, separate what is human from what is technology, as I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view technology as a human artifact; a series of methods produced to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> extend
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or secure a human function.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For those not familier or unable to access Kurzweil's book, Moravec in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1998
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> made a similar extrapolation in 'When will computer hardware match the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> human
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> brain'. This essay simply demonstrates that as the years go by, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> becoming more possible than the day before to have the outcomes I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposed here and elsewhere.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We have the ability to do a variety of things people do well with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> distributed computer networks, so we have the computational capacity
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a single human brain already. Its just a matter of determining the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and figuring what artifact, ideally adaptive, that might address it and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems the many other problems that come after it. So solving problems

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Paul
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Fernhout has in his wonderfully expansive source references. Regardless,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know its possible because of nomadic societies living well without
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trade and from reflecting deeply within myself to that which surfaces
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> emotion and seeing that it is a most reasonable moral pursuit. Many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have spoken in admitting they would prefer not to have any compromise for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> living, tells me there are enough people here on earth to pursue the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ability
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to care for themselves without compromising others, call it alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> currency if you like, it remains a compromise, no matter how ethically or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> evenly you frame it. A market is a compromise. No matter how &quot;fair&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;even&quot; or &quot;equal&quot; the exchange is, judgement is made toward a value of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing before it is addressed; and worse; at least two people must decide
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that it is of one measurable value. The measurement of value destroys it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my view, becasue to measure value is to destroy what generated its worth
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> begin with, and cannot possibly account for what produced the 'thing' of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> value. This is one argument that demonstrates why I am so strongly for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> basic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> income or gift economies or freedom without markets because it lets the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> individual decide what to do and what is valuable. However innefficient
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> selfish that may be; these rough edges can be soften by technological
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implements that ensure free human behavior serves the needs or wants of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> others, intended or not. We're seeing this surface with 'recommendation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> engines' like Amazon or friend suggestions on Facebook from simple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'friend-of-a-friend' algorithms that simply see who's a friend of your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> friend and makes a suggestion for you to befriend them. When this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> applied in an 'interest-of-interest', then we can see the people that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> share
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular interests like engineering or 3d modeling or robotics and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contact
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these people to build that magical technology that will solve many of our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (Ahh, but there's always a catch, a cost, a price. . . yes. . . its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> profit of the sort that cannot be measured and of which we can hardly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> imagine; a profit that will turn our views of children as pests, as many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> see do to my detriment and anger, into the most brilliant of beings, as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use what we build to do far more amazing things that what you may well
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> already damned for yourself, long ago. But of course, we're seeing that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people can quickly adapt, so I have hope for overgrown children as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That is not to say we will approve of what they do; I suspect that like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good parent we will not!)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If I thought the word 'technology' represented a magical thing that will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> soon 'solve all of our problems', I would not be so interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ensuring
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that our tools nurture individuals and communities. So my concern is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ensuring the exponential growth of technical developments enable rather
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> destroy people. Many people will likely want to 'destroy' themselves from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view, such as manipulate their DNA or replace bodily biologies with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'better'
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> artificial replacements to a degree that would make them post-human. Many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this group find this unattractive as I do.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What I find dissapointing is only a few people are expressing on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lists
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I follow try to present full or broader technologically packaged ways
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> toward
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> going toward an abundant environment. For one they may fear being viewed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a fool for trying, such as on the open manufacturing list where many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are tech friendly and savvy. For those on the p2presearch list, I've
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experienced a sentiment of the rejection technology as a viable solution
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> social problems; which I find rather unusual, since we're using a highly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> advanced integrated media to have this very discussion. Perhaps I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> been criticized (thank you for the criticism, Herbert, as this will help
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> us
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> improve our lives in some way) not because you view technology as a bad
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing, but because I have failed to address how badly technology is used.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> believe addressing the ills are rhetorical as the ills are clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expressed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in every Industrial mass production based civilization today. Just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> acknowledge your feelings reflectively as you behave; and your body will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tell you what is right and what is wrong: for you.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Without technologies like netbooks and the web life would be worse off.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it were not for computers and the web, I'd probably be miserable in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> university class room or miserable teaching in a university classroom for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lack of knowing anything else better to pursue. That's not to say I think
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> universities are awful places, but they are rather depressing, so will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to become more flexible for me to have much tolerance for them, as I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> believe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any student, especially one (usually the parents) that pays
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> such outrageous fees, to follow the 'path of the [compartmentalized]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elders'
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> insisted today.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It likely required more arms to put food into your mouth than your own.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This means someone is doing something they much would rather not. That
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> must
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change. Those three final sentences sum up my overall interest in the P2P
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Foundation as a researcher and developer; to help people feed themselves
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without making others hungry. If you think such goals are not appropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the P2P Foundation, I'd rather not go anywhere else, because I like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people too much, because you seem to 'get it' as a whole more than any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> social collective I've encountered.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My critics (that's good; it means I may be saying something of value!)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> say that may well have read well, but its not good enough, and that I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> must
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> say more, present more sources, and so on. If this becomes the case, I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be encouraged to elaborate, but if not, that means what I have said is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enough to work with. I do not think it is in itself, which is why we're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alive I suppose, but I hope it is at least convincing enough to critique.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm pretty confused as to what to call myself as I seem to use a variety
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> disciplines. Until I can think of something better than post-scarcity
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> theorist, that 'fool's game' at present, (so I'll accept the title of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fool
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as well) as it is greatly dependent on that fuzzy thing we call
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> technology.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (unless you're interested in the sort of post-scarcity that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> measured
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scientifically, what Paul Fernhout calls pre-scarcity, then you're a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> primitivist, not all that interesting in my opinion, as we know this to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work, but without all the groovy toys I think and what others believe are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> worth keeping) There is a reason technology is a separate discipline from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> science. . . Technology is difficult today to measure social outcomes, so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm addressing technology for reasons of personal and community
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> autonomony,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this may seem to make things even more difficult as the modeler must
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> address
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what devices are needed to solve x and of what quantity and quality. This
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> provides an interesting challenge to the systems modeler or post-scarcity
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> theorist, but until that is better explored and placed into a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> coordination
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform, as to how to model technology in regard to its social effect in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> way that makes people present their works more transparently, if it is to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ungrounded

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> present that case; bless him.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whatever I may lack in precision I hope to make up for in coordinating
