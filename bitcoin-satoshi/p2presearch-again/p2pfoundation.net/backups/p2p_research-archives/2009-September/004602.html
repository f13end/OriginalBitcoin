</I>&gt;<i> Tehran Ramps Up Campaign Against 'Immoral' Websites
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Iranians flock to Internet cafes in Tehran.
</I>&gt;<i> December 15, 2008
</I>&gt;<i> By Farangis Najibullah
</I>&gt;<i> The Iranian authorities, who admit to blocking access to over 5 million
</I>&gt;<i> websites, have decided to take additional measures to restrict Internet
</I>&gt;<i> access and crack down on bloggers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Iranian news agencies recently quoted Tehran prosecutor Said Mortazavi as
</I>&gt;<i> saying those behind irreligious and immoral websites would be &quot;harshly
</I>&gt;<i> confronted.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The prosecutor's office has set up a special department to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> Internet &quot;crimes.&quot; Mortazavi said a team of Internet experts along with two
</I>&gt;<i> officials would identify and block websites that &quot;do not follow religious
</I>&gt;<i> principles and are immoral.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RFE/RL's Radio Farda has reported that intelligence services would also
</I>&gt;<i> take part in the campaign.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier this month, Esmail Jafari, a blogger from the southwestern city of
</I>&gt;<i> Bushehr was sentenced to five months in prison. He was found guilty of
</I>&gt;<i> antigovernment publicity and disseminating information abroad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based media rights groups,
</I>&gt;<i> at least two online journalists, Mojtaba Lotfi and Shahnaz Gholami, are
</I>&gt;<i> currently being detained in Iran.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gholami, an editor of the &quot;Azar Zan&quot; blog, was charged with jeopardizing
</I>&gt;<i> national security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In October, an adviser to Iran's chief prosecutor said more than 5 million
</I>&gt;<i> antisocial and immoral websites have been blocked and are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> accessible in the country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most recently, an Iranian dating website, &quot;Hamsarchat,&quot; was fined and
</I>&gt;<i> banned after being accused of promoting prostitution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The popular website, which claims to be &quot;Iran's most complete
</I>&gt;<i> spouse-finding website,&quot; has been taken to court following a complaint from
</I>&gt;<i> Tehran's public prosecutor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Growing Internet Presence
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With some 20 million people with access to the Internet, Iran is one of the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest Internet users in the Middle East. And despite all the blocks,
</I>&gt;<i> filtering, and other restrictions, blogging is becoming increasingly
</I>&gt;<i> popular.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to media reports, there are some 65,000 bloggers in Iran, most of
</I>&gt;<i> whom try to stay away from political issues, focusing instead on social,
</I>&gt;<i> art, family, and other safer topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the popularity of the Internet, especially, among young people, and its
</I>&gt;<i> impact on society is obviously a source of concern for the Iranian
</I>&gt;<i> authorities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some Iranian leaders have warned that the West is trying to provoke a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; in Iran using the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alongside Iranian music, news, and political websites, they have also
</I>&gt;<i> blocked access to popular foreign sites such as YouTube and Facebook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, according to Said, a blogger in Tehran, the authorities' &quot;old
</I>&gt;<i> method of filtering is not working anymore.&quot; Said tells Radio Farda that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;with simple software or proxies, you can avoid any filter.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, Iran's authorities and religious leaders are themselves
</I>&gt;<i> trying to use the Internet to get their message out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From clerics in the holy city of Qom to President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, they
</I>&gt;<i> have set up personal websites to promote their ideas to the public.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Protest as Facebook removes breastfeeding photos
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As part of a Facebook users' rebellion against the site, a group blitzed it
</I>&gt;<i> with breastfeeding photos, some of which were taken down
</I>&gt;<i> Mike Harvey, Technology Correspondent
</I>&gt;<i> Alpha Mummy: Facebook needs to grow up
</I>&gt;<i> A mass online protest movement is gathering pace after Facebook banned some
</I>&gt;<i> breastfeeding photos from the social network site.
</I>&gt;<i> Angry mothers even picketed the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto,
</I>&gt;<i> California, in a live &quot;nurse-in&quot; to complain about a ban on photos of
</I>&gt;<i> mothers suckling their children that exposed too much of the mother's
</I>&gt;<i> breast. Hundreds of women have had their pictures removed without warning
</I>&gt;<i> and have been informed that they may be barred from using the site.
</I>&gt;<i> More than 80,000 people have joined a Facebook petition group &quot;Hey
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook, Breast-feeding is not Obscene&quot; with hundreds joining every hour.
</I>&gt;<i> More than 11,000 women from around the world have also taken part in an
</I>&gt;<i> online &quot;nurse-in&quot; protest on Saturday by posting more breastfeeding
</I>&gt;<i> pictures. The protest's organisers reported that many have since had these
</I>&gt;<i> photos removed from the site.
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook has said that it has no problem with breastfeeding but photos that
</I>&gt;<i> showed nipples or aureolae were indecent and had to be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> Barry Schnitt, a Facebook spokesman, said the website takes no action over
</I>&gt;<i> most breast-feeding photos because they follow the site's terms of use.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We agree that breast-feeding is natural and beautiful and we're very glad
</I>&gt;<i> to know that it is so important to some mothers to share this experience
</I>&gt;<i> with others on Facebook.'' But, he added, some photos were removed to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> the site remains safe and secure for all users, including children.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Photos containing a fully exposed breast - as defined by showing the
</I>&gt;<i> nipple or areola - do violate those terms on obscene, pornographic or
</I>&gt;<i> sexually explicit material and may be removed,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> photos we act upon are almost exclusively brought to our attention by other
</I>&gt;<i> users who complain.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Patricia Madden, from San Jose, had a photograph of her breastfeeding her
</I>&gt;<i> daughters Zoe and Isobel removed from the site. The birth doula, who
</I>&gt;<i> encourages new mothers to breast-feed, was photographed by her husband while
</I>&gt;<i> feeding in the bathtub.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's amazing to me that we're living in a world where people are upset by
</I>&gt;<i> this,'' she said. &quot;You can't see my nipples. It's completely legal to
</I>&gt;<i> breast-feed in public. Breast-feeding is completely natural and healthy.
</I>&gt;<i> They took off the photo, without my permission,&quot; she told the San Jose
</I>&gt;<i> Mercury News.
</I>&gt;<i> The live protest in Palo Alto, under the banner of the Mothers
</I>&gt;<i> International Lactation Campaign, attracted a handful of mothers and
</I>&gt;<i> supporters who picketed peacefully, armed with suckling children and
</I>&gt;<i> placards.
</I>&gt;<i> It is legal to breastfeed in public in most states in America and in many
</I>&gt;<i> countries around the world including Britain but Facebook's terms of service
</I>&gt;<i> give it the right to remove content that it deems it to be inappropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> Campaigners say that breastfeeding is natural and healthy and should be not
</I>&gt;<i> bracketed with pornography. Facebook's stance demeans and stigmatises women,
</I>&gt;<i> they say.
</I>&gt;<i> Heather Farley, 23, of Provo, Utah, said she was surprised when Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> took down two photos of her nursing her 6-month-old daughter, one of which
</I>&gt;<i> was her profile picture. She became of the protest's organisers. She said:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Where I live, I can breast-feed in public or private, and there are laws
</I>&gt;<i> that say it's not obscene or lewd or indecent. If I can do it in public, why
</I>&gt;<i> can't I do it on Facebook?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Censoring such images, she said, reinforces stigmas that discourage mothers
</I>&gt;<i> from a healthy, natural practice. Angry at the site, but not wanting to lose
</I>&gt;<i> her online friend network by unsubscribing, she decided to take action.
</I>&gt;<i> The online petition on Facebook, which has more than 120 million members
</I>&gt;<i> around the world, has sparked a furious debate with more than 1,500
</I>&gt;<i> discussion topics on the petition's homepage. Most comments are supportive
</I>&gt;<i> but some ask why, if breastfeeding mothers don't like being censored on
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook, they don't join another free site which does allow them to post
</I>&gt;<i> their pictures.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Breastfeeding mothers have launched an online protest against Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> after images of them suckling their babies were removed from their profiles
</I>&gt;<i> without warning.
</I>&gt;<i> More than 80,000 people have joined the Facebook petition group &quot;Hey

</I>&gt;<i> Technology and protest in Myanmar
</I>&gt;<i> By Dheera Sujan
</I>&gt;<i> 05-12-2008
</I>&gt;<i> An ordinary telephone SIM card costs just two US dollars in Bangkok. In
</I>&gt;<i> Myanmar, less than an hour away by plane, it costs 1800 US dollars. This in
</I>&gt;<i> a country where a surgeon is lucky to take home 100 US dollars a month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet there are more mobile phones in the towns and cities of this closed
</I>&gt;<i> country than its army led government would like. And mobile phones were key
</I>&gt;<i> instruments in the organisation and news dissemination of last September's
</I>&gt;<i> pro democracy protests led by monks - illustrating exactly why the leading
</I>&gt;<i> Junta fear the access to the outside world that technology offers.
</I>&gt;<i> The September protests were caught by the countless mobile phones of
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary people or shot at great risk by the hidden video cameras of
</I>&gt;<i> undercover reporters and sent out of the country within minutes through the
</I>&gt;<i> internet. Smuggled video tapes found their way to mainstream media around
</I>&gt;<i> the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile video footage of a Japanese journalist shot at close range
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scenes of violence shown on Al-Jazeera
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unprecedented coverage
</I>&gt;<i> For a few days Burmese monks led civilian protesters on the streets of
</I>&gt;<i> Yangon, and the international community watched, electrified by the
</I>&gt;<i> unprecedented images of a country that had remained behind its own bamboo
</I>&gt;<i> curtain for years. At first, the Myanmar government was paralysed with
</I>&gt;<i> indecision. Then it did what most feared it would - it called in the troops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And still the cameras rolled, still the images were loaded onto YouTube. A
</I>&gt;<i> Japanese cameraman, shot at point blank range by a soldier, troops shooting
</I>&gt;<i> into crowds of civilians, police beating monks with iron bars, and dragging
</I>&gt;<i> off peaceful demonstrators holding banners.
</I>&gt;<i> Having their story told
</I>&gt;<i> The world was watching Myanmar for the first time in decades and the
</I>&gt;<i> Burmese people, forcibly isolated for so long, were exultantly aware that
</I>&gt;<i> they were not forgotten. &quot;It's almost an existential desire for the Burmese
</I>&gt;<i> to have their story told,&quot; says one journalist who has written and reported
</I>&gt;<i> from the country for more than 20 years. She was there during the protests
</I>&gt;<i> last year, and she was there when the retribution came.
</I>&gt;<i> Just a few weeks ago, the government of Myanmar apprehended leaders of the
</I>&gt;<i> protests, monks, journalists, and bloggers and sentenced them to up to 65
</I>&gt;<i> years in prison. The bloggers were accused of violating the Electronics Act
</I>&gt;<i> which regulates electronic communications.
</I>&gt;<i> The sentences are breathtakingly harsh, and they send a clear message from
</I>&gt;<i> the government - that it will brook no opposition from within during the
</I>&gt;<i> run-up to the elections planned for 2010. But there is also a hidden message
</I>&gt;<i> in the single-minded way people who sent images of human rights violations
</I>&gt;<i> out of the country have been hunted down: that the government too can use
</I>&gt;<i> technology to its own benefit. People have been traced through their email
</I>&gt;<i> and mobile phones and internet servers have been examined for &quot;improper
</I>&gt;<i> use&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cat and mouse
</I>&gt;<i> The government has even mined the very same images of the violent put-down
</I>&gt;<i> of the demonstrators to locate the shops, doorways and homes where people
</I>&gt;<i> may have taken the footage and then made group arrests to find the
</I>&gt;<i> photographers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as the journalist says, &quot;it's a cat and mouse game. The government
</I>&gt;<i> blocks the technology in one way and people find alternatives to go around
</I>&gt;<i> it. There are proxy servers springing up all the time...it won't stop. The
</I>&gt;<i> people will always find a way of making their voice heard. It's always been
</I>&gt;<i> that way in Burma.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> Anti-government Facebook protests fizzle
</I>&gt;<i> Croatian Times
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-government protests organized on Facebook fizzled Friday when roughly
</I>&gt;<i> 3,500 people turned out for a demonstration that organizers hoped would draw
</I>&gt;<i> 60,000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About 2,500 people gathered in the capital, Zagreb. Several hundred turned
</I>&gt;<i> up in Croatia's second-largest city, Split, and a few hundred more in five
</I>&gt;<i> other cities to protest government austerity measures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's easier to click a mouse, in the safety of your home, than show up in
</I>&gt;<i> public,&quot; said Jaksa Matovinovic, a spokesman for the group that organized
</I>&gt;<i> the protest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, the protests demonstrated that online social networks have began to
</I>&gt;<i> have some political impact in this former Yugoslav republic, where only 2 in
</I>&gt;<i> 5 households have access to the Internet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Younger generations are well-versed in the Internet, but gaffes by some
</I>&gt;<i> politicians reflect Croatia's relative computer illiteracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker of parliament Vladimir Seks called the social networking Web site
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Facebok.&quot; Opposition lawmaker Mato Arlovic, spoke of &quot;emajl&quot; - enamel in
</I>&gt;<i> Croatian - when he meant e-mail. And former Interior Minister Ivica Kirin
</I>&gt;<i> called YouTube &quot;Jubito&quot; in a widely played clip posted on that site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Facebook group, called &quot;Tighten your own belt, you gang of knaves,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> criticized Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's measures to fight a potential
</I>&gt;<i> financial crisis, saying they would hurt the average Croat while politicians
</I>&gt;<i> and the rich would be unscathed. It also blames the government for failing
</I>&gt;<i> to fight crime and corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Only united we are becoming a force that no one can ignore,&quot; the group's

</I>&gt;<i> TurboTax Withdraws Price Hike after Protest
</I>&gt;<i> Reported by: John Matarese
</I>&gt;<i> Email: <A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">jmatarese at wcpo.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Last Update: 12/15/2008 6:19 pm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TurboTax has been the number one do it yourself tax program for years
</I>&gt;<i> ....because it's easy to use, provides great support, and is so affordable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that affordability may be a thing of the past, according to some people
</I>&gt;<i> who have looked at the newest version for the 2008/2009 filing season.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Online Complaints force Reconsideration
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're a TurboTax user, you may be amazed by the angry reviews the
</I>&gt;<i> newest version is getting at Amazon.com and various online blogs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the good news: Turbotax is now reversing at least some of its latest
</I>&gt;<i> new fees....because of all the online outrage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are so many users unhappy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For starters, TurboTax is raising the price of its popular deluxe version
</I>&gt;<i> from $45 to $59.  That was enough to anger many veteran users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But more controversial: It was also planning to eliminate free sharing
</I>&gt;<i> among family members. In the past, you could use one version to prepare
</I>&gt;<i> taxes for up to 5 family members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Power of the Internet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But Turbox has now reconsided and is withdrawing that plan after online
</I>&gt;<i> protests, which demonstrates the power of the internet. In addition, it's
</I>&gt;<i> adding free e-filing this year, so the price hike is not as bad as it
</I>&gt;<i> appears.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But my advice? If you dont like the new price, consider H&amp;R Block's TaxCut,
</I>&gt;<i> TaxAct (free or paid versions), or other programs. And read online reviews
</I>&gt;<i> before purchasing a program: They'll tell you a lot about changes in each
</I>&gt;<i> program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'The good news is that as you prepare for April 15th, you have a lot of tax
</I>&gt;<i> prep options...And if one software program has become too expensive, you
</I>&gt;<i> have time to find another, so you don't waste your money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm John Matarese.

</I>&gt;<i> Student movements go high-tech
</I>&gt;<i> By Hung Chen-ling &#27946;&#35998;&#29618;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Friday, Nov 21, 2008, Page 8
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Hello, this is XXX, coming to you live from Taipei. We are going to
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast a three-party talk live around half past 12. We are currently
</I>&gt;<i> doing some technical tests, so please stand by ...&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> These familiar opening lines did not come from a TV program or a full-time
</I>&gt;<i> reporter, but from the student demonstrators at Liberty Square in Taipei,
</I>&gt;<i> who transmitted information to everyone with Internet access. Not only is
</I>&gt;<i> this a historical change for Taiwan&#8217;s student movements, it is also
</I>&gt;<i> challenging the prejudice and distortions of mainstream media in reporting
</I>&gt;<i> dissenting opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not an overstatement to view the demonstration as a &#8220;high-tech
</I>&gt;<i> student movement.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the beginning, between 400 and 500 students were mobilized overnight
</I>&gt;<i> using the Internet to a rally staged in front of the Executive Yuan, where
</I>&gt;<i> the students expressed their dissatisfaction with alleged police brutality
</I>&gt;<i> during the recent visit by Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
</I>&gt;<i> Strait Chairman Chen Yunlin (&#38515;&#38642;&#26519;) and the Assembly and Parade Law (&#38598;&#26371;&#36938;&#34892;&#27861;)
</I>&gt;<i> that is said to have violated the protesters&#8217; freedom of speech. While
</I>&gt;<i> reporters were still covering anti-Chen demonstrations at the Grand Hotel
</I>&gt;<i> and Grand Formosa Regent Taipei where a massive police presence was
</I>&gt;<i> stationed, students had already sent out messages about their sit-in
</I>&gt;<i> protests on the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After being moved from the Executive Yuan by police, students regrouped at
</I>&gt;<i> Liberty Square to protest. It was amazing that in addition to rain shelters
</I>&gt;<i> and generators, tables and chairs, four to five computers were set up in a
</I>&gt;<i> row at the venue. The young generation is not only familiar with Internet
</I>&gt;<i> technology, but also able to broadcast news live in Chinese, English and
</I>&gt;<i> Japanese and send information thousands of kilometers away. The 24-hour live
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast became a live, uncut reality show of the student&#8217;s demands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They told the public: &#8220;Whatever mainstream media outlets cannot or are not
</I>&gt;<i> willing to do, we will do by ourselves. We will be our own media.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> High-tech social movements initiated on the Internet have existed for a
</I>&gt;<i> while. The Internet allows non-government organizations and local
</I>&gt;<i> communities to effectively form alliances across borders. In particular,
</I>&gt;<i> when an issue comes up, the Internet can help further discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> communication between organizations, or even mobilize people with a
</I>&gt;<i> particular position in an attempt to change the development of the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another example is the Internet mobilization of Chinese people around the
</I>&gt;<i> world in protest of assaults and killings of ethnic Chinese women in
</I>&gt;<i> Indonesia.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last year, up to 20,000 residents of Xiamen City in China&#8217;s Fujian Province
</I>&gt;<i> were mobilized through cellphone text messages and through the Internet to
</I>&gt;<i> protest against the construction of a chemical plant in the city.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, the Internet serves as a mouthpiece for disadvantaged
</I>&gt;<i> groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Zapatista Army of National Liberation is a revolutionary group in
</I>&gt;<i> Chiapas, Mexico consisting of grassroots farmers who suffered from the North
</I>&gt;<i> American Free Trade Agreement, and who were besieged by heavily armed police
</I>&gt;<i> forces. However, this grassroots resistance gained international support
</I>&gt;<i> after uploading locally gathered information onto the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Images circulated on the Internet of masked guerillas left a deep
</I>&gt;<i> impression on many people. In addition, this revolutionary movement and the
</I>&gt;<i> way it is voicing its opposition have been described as the first
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;post-modern&#8221; movement by the New York Times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way the aforementioned social movements used the real-time,
</I>&gt;<i> interactivity and far-reaching high tech of the Internet can all be found in
</I>&gt;<i> the student demonstration on Liberty Square. Using the Internet, the student
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrators connected to all of Taiwan and implemented deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy to make their voice heard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let this serve as a warning to both the establishment and its bureaucrats
</I>&gt;<i> and mainstream media outlets: Passive inaction and selective or distorted
</I>&gt;<i> reporting will no longer convince the public because the government and the
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream media are no longer the only sources of news.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it cannot be denied that a successful movement needs not only
</I>&gt;<i> technology, but also the power of discourse and organization as a foundation
</I>&gt;<i> for its broadcasts. This is the challenge facing student movements when they
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to overcome the external obstacles to getting their voices heard.

</I>&gt;<i> Today 70 Saudi activists launched a two-day hunger strike via Facebook to
</I>&gt;<i> protest the detention of 11 human rights activists who have been held in
</I>&gt;<i> Saudi Arabia for months - some for almost two years - without charge.
</I>&gt;<i> Operating under oppressive restraints of freedom of expression and assembly,
</I>&gt;<i> the activists' defense team and supporters have harnessed the power of
</I>&gt;<i> online tools to amplify their voices and calls for justice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Calling for the release - or fair and public trails - of detainees is
</I>&gt;<i> incredibly restrictive under the absolute monarch. In July 2007, the
</I>&gt;<i> Mabahith, Saudi secret police, arrested five women who were peacefully
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrating for the release or trial of their relatives detained for over
</I>&gt;<i> two years without trial. Operating under oppressive restraints of freedom of
</I>&gt;<i> expression and assembly, the activists' defense team and supporters have
</I>&gt;<i> harnessed the power of online tools to amplify their voices and calls for
</I>&gt;<i> justice.
</I>&gt;<i> Under Saudi law, one can be detained for up to six months (and up to 60
</I>&gt;<i> days in solitary confinement) without a formal sentencing or trial. Once in
</I>&gt;<i> custody, detainees are &quot;commonly the victims of systematic and multiple
</I>&gt;<i> violations of due process and fair trial rights, including arbitrary arrest
</I>&gt;<i> and torture and ill-treatment during interrogation,&quot; according to Human
</I>&gt;<i> Rights Watch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We are trying to introduce a culture of protest where there is none.
</I>&gt;<i> Without the Internet, this wouldn't have been possible,&quot; said Mr.
</I>&gt;<i> al-Qahtani, an organizer of the hunger strike in an interview with Canada's
</I>&gt;<i> Globe and Mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A combination of few freedoms to assemble, express or associate oneself
</I>&gt;<i> publicly, reasonably high internet connectivity, and a 60% population under
</I>&gt;<i> the age of 30 has made it possible for this unprecedented event to occur
</I>&gt;<i> online. Word is quickly spreading in online chat rooms, social networks and
</I>&gt;<i> the blogosphere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> World media is reporting on this unprecendented act of civil disobedience.
</I>&gt;<i> Watch an exclusive video interview with Saudi journalist Ebtihal Mubarak
</I>&gt;<i> about the hunger strike at <A HREF="http://hub.witness.org/en/SaudiHungerStrike.">http://hub.witness.org/en/SaudiHungerStrike.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> WITNESS' online channel for human rights video, the Hub, was fortunate
</I>&gt;<i> enough to attain the only video interview on this subject, due to its strict
</I>&gt;<i> adherence to safety and security issues for participants.

</I>&gt;<i> Though this is not the first human rights-related campaign from the region
</I>&gt;<i> on Facebook (see WIRED's &quot;Cairo Activists Use Facebook to Rattle Regime&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> it is notable because it's the first one of its kind in Saudi Arabia to get
</I>&gt;<i> around repressive laws by harnessing power and the ubiquity of the internet
</I>&gt;<i> to gain attention and hopefully change policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you'll share this info with your online colleagues who may have more
</I>&gt;<i> room to cover this story online or continue to look to WITNESS and the Hub

</I>&gt;<i> Saudi hunger strikers risk arrest for protest

</I>&gt;<i> SONIA VERMA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From Friday's Globe and Mail
</I>&gt;<i> November 6, 2008 at 10:17 PM EST
</I>&gt;<i> JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia &#8212; Mohammad al-Qahtani rose before dawn, kissed his
</I>&gt;<i> children and prayed before embarking on the most radical act of his life: He
</I>&gt;<i> skipped breakfast.
</I>&gt;<i> The professor of economics is among a group of 64 Saudis staging this
</I>&gt;<i> conservative kingdom's first public hunger strike, denouncing the detention
</I>&gt;<i> of nearly a dozen political prisoners.
</I>&gt;<i> To outsiders, the two-day protest might seem tame, but in a country where
</I>&gt;<i> political parties, civic organizations and public rallies are strictly
</I>&gt;<i> banned, the strikers could face arrest for dissent.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Yes, we are afraid,&#8221; Mr. al-Qahtani, 43, said, &#8220;but to get our message out
</I>&gt;<i> we are willing to take the risk.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> He admits, however, their risk is a calculated one.
</I>&gt;<i> The protest, which ends Friday, was timed to coincide with the weekend here
</I>&gt;<i> so strikers could fast in hiding or in the safety of their own homes.
</I>&gt;<i> Recruitment was also kept low-key, with organizers using online networks
</I>&gt;<i> such as Facebook to enlist supporters and talk to each other.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;We are trying to introduce a culture of protest where there is none.
</I>&gt;<i> Without the Internet, this wouldn't have been possible,&#8221; Mr. al-Qahtani
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledged.
</I>&gt;<i> Saudi's state-controlled media have not reported on the strike, although
</I>&gt;<i> the story is beginning to capture headlines in the international press.
</I>&gt;<i> The protesters' demands centre on the cases of 11 prisoners who are being
</I>&gt;<i> held in Jeddah and Riyadh jails without charge.
</I>&gt;<i> Strikers are demanding the Saudi government give the prisoners fair, public
</I>&gt;<i> trials or set them free.
</I>&gt;<i> Nine of the detained men, who were arrested in Jeddah in February, 2007,
</I>&gt;<i> were accused of supporting terrorism and sent to solitary confinement
</I>&gt;<i> without formal charge.
</I>&gt;<i> Human-rights groups say they were jailed for pressing for political reform.
</I>&gt;<i> The most high-profile prisoner is Matrouk al-Faleh, a political science
</I>&gt;<i> professor at Riyadh's King Saud University, who was arrested in May after
</I>&gt;<i> publishing a report criticizing conditions in Saudi jails.
</I>&gt;<i> He was previously jailed in 2003 after calling for a constitutional
</I>&gt;<i> monarchy, but was subsequently freed by King Abdullah when he assumed the
</I>&gt;<i> throne in 2005.
</I>&gt;<i> In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Mr. al-Faleh's wife, Jamila, said
</I>&gt;<i> she didn't think the hunger strike would change her husband's fate.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;It won't solve our problem, but at least I feel there are others who are
</I>&gt;<i> standing with us,&#8221; said Ms. Al-Faleh, who is only allowed to visit her
</I>&gt;<i> husband once a week and says his health is declining.
</I>&gt;<i> Government officials canvassed by The Globe said they were unaware of any
</I>&gt;<i> protest but, hypothetically speaking, said hunger strikes are against the
</I>&gt;<i> law.
</I>&gt;<i> They declined to comment on the cases of the 11 men in detention.
</I>&gt;<i> With the government effectively ignoring the protest, it was unclear what
</I>&gt;<i> kind of impact it would have.
</I>&gt;<i> The activists, mostly young, prominent Saudis &#8211; lawyers, writers,
</I>&gt;<i> professors and journalists &#8211; hold positions that would likely insulate them
</I>&gt;<i> from harsh prosecution.
</I>&gt;<i> Some hoped their protest would encourage others from all walks of Saudi
</I>&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;<i> Others described their participation as personal victories.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I see the hunger strike as my little personal gesture to the detainees,&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> wrote Ahmed al-Omran, a popular Saudi blogger known as Saudijeans.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I don't know what it would mean to them or if they even know about it, but
</I>&gt;<i> it certainly means something to me. It means that I do not accept
</I>&gt;<i> injustice,&#8221; he wrote.

</I>&gt;<i> Rwanda: Protests Against Kabuye's Arrest Go Online
</I>&gt;<i> Edwin Musoni
</I>&gt;<i> 18 November 2008
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kigali &#8212; Thousands have signed various online petitions posted on the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet calling for the release of Director of State Protocol Rose Kabuye
</I>&gt;<i> who was arrested ten days ago in Germany.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> Kabuye was on November 9, arrested in Frankfurt, following the contentious
</I>&gt;<i> indictments by the French Judge Jean Louis Bruguiere.
</I>&gt;<i> The Judge alleges that she was involved in the shooting down of Rwanda's
</I>&gt;<i> former president, Juvenal Habyarimana's plane in 1994. She was arrested
</I>&gt;<i> while on official state business.
</I>&gt;<i> The online petitions are calling for the immediate release of Kabuye, they
</I>&gt;<i> also attack the French and Germany governments for their collective abuse of
</I>&gt;<i> the principle of Universal Jurisdiction.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the petition letters read in part that Kabuye is considered a hero
</I>&gt;<i> and a liberator in ending the 1994 Tutsi Genocide that was observed and
</I>&gt;<i> supervised by the French.
</I>&gt;<i> The letters also express suspicion that the arrest is politically motivated
</I>&gt;<i> by the French government and calls upon Rwandans, their friends and
</I>&gt;<i> supporters from across the world to protest it.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the websites <A HREF="http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/freerosekabuyecalls">http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/freerosekabuyecalls</A> on Rwandans to see the action of France as another war on them.
</I>&gt;<i> Another website, www.petitionspot.com/petitions/RoseKabuye, states that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;upon signing the petition, you are strengthening this effort in gaining
</I>&gt;<i> true rights, and strengthening the freedom of a world wide community.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The petitions are expected to be produced and presented to the French
</I>&gt;<i> Embassies around the world as a sign of the world communities' intolerance
</I>&gt;<i> for justice.

</I>&gt;<i> Brazil: Flash mob protest against Digital Crimes Bill
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sunday, November 16th, 2008 @ 11:05 UTC
</I>&gt;<i> by Paula G&#243;es
</I>&gt;<i> Brazilian bloggers and netizens took to the streets of S&#227;o Paulo to protest
</I>&gt;<i> against the Digital Crimes Bill, which typifies the cyber-crimes punishable
</I>&gt;<i> by law and stipulates penalties accordingly. They claim the law has so many
</I>&gt;<i> flaws that, instead of punishing real criminals, it might end up deeming as
</I>&gt;<i> crime trivial conduct when surfing the Internet. Proposed by senator Eduardo
</I>&gt;<i> Azeredo, the bill has passed through the Senate, has proceeded to the House
</I>&gt;<i> of Representatives and has been labeled as urgent, which means that voting
</I>&gt;<i> might happen at any time.
</I>&gt;<i> Over 50 bloggers, students and netizens participated in the flash mob last
</I>&gt;<i> Friday at Avenida Paulista, one of the city's most important avenues and
</I>&gt;<i> financial centers. The protest was organized through blogs and mostly
</I>&gt;<i> twitter. L&#250;cia Freitas reports:
</I>&gt;<i> A postos, mostramos nossos cartazes. algu&#233;m de dentro do &#244;nibus acena.
</I>&gt;<i> Pessoas param nas cal&#231;adas de ambos os lados. Motos e carros buzinam. Ao
</I>&gt;<i> comando, viramos para o outro lado (&#237;mpar) da avenida. Os fot&#243;grafos fazem
</I>&gt;<i> farra. A gente diz em alto e bom som: N&#227;o!
</I>&gt;<i> Put in place, we showed our posters. Someone waves at us from inside a bus.
</I>&gt;<i> People stop on both sides of sidewalks. Motorcycles and cars honk their
</I>&gt;<i> horns. At the command, we turn to the other side of the avenue.
</I>&gt;<i> Photographers enjoy it. We say in loud and clear voices: No!
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, due to bad weather and terrible traffic, many people only managed
</I>&gt;<i> to get there late. Political Scientist S&#233;rgio Amadeu [pt] says that these
</I>&gt;<i> late comers demanded to be part of the protest, so a quick decision was made
</I>&gt;<i> for another performance, this time attended by over 100 people:
</I>&gt;<i> Bom, como uma manifesta&#231;&#227;o auto-organizada ela resolveu se auto-constituir
</I>&gt;<i> de novo. A flashmob virou uma refreshmob.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as an auto-organized protest, it decided to reproduce itself again.
</I>&gt;<i> The flashmob became a refreshmob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Photo by Paulo Fehlauer who also has a video showing the protest at Avenida
</I>&gt;<i> Paulista
</I>&gt;<i> On the day before, a public hearing was held in Bras&#237;lia and some bloggers
</I>&gt;<i> took the time to attend the debate (see a video and twitter reactions). They
</I>&gt;<i> had their mouths closed with sellotape to protest against the
</I>&gt;<i> over-surveillance on the Internet that the bill may bring if approved.
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel Padua [pt] was there and said it had a positive outcome as the case
</I>&gt;<i> against was very well laid by both specialists and members of parliament:
</I>&gt;<i> A for&#231;a dos argumentos foi uma surpresa pros defensores do projeto, que
</I>&gt;<i> acabaram soando rid&#237;culos e despreparados - como no caso do delegado da PF
</I>&gt;<i> (alguma coisa Sobral) - que apresentou uma hist&#243;ria na qual a PF tinha os
</I>&gt;<i> IPs de suspeitos de pedofilia, mas s&#243; conseguiu prender 1/5 deles pela falta
</I>&gt;<i> de um processo jur&#237;dico adequado, e foi questionado pelo deputado Paulo
</I>&gt;<i> Teixeira: &#8220;bom, a PF tinha os IPs, n&#227;o? ent&#227;o se voc&#234;s j&#225; conseguem os IPs
</I>&gt;<i> das pessoas, porque precisam desse projeto de lei?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> The strength of the arguments (against the bill) was a surprise for the
</I>&gt;<i> project supporters, who ended up sounding silly and unprepared - as in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of a police officer who had a history in which the police had the IPs
</I>&gt;<i> of suspected pedophiles, but only managed to arrest 1/5 of them because of
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of an appropriate legal process. He was questioned by parliament
</I>&gt;<i> member Paulo Teixeira: &#8220;Well, the PF had the IPs, right? So if you already
</I>&gt;<i> get people's IPs, what do you need this bill for?&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i> Marcelo Tr&#228;sel [pt] says that a battle was won but the fight goes ahead. He
</I>&gt;<i> unveils whose interests are in fact behind the bill:
</I>&gt;<i> Porque no fim das contas &#233; disso que se trata: os bancos est&#227;o tentando
</I>&gt;<i> impor uma legisla&#231;&#227;o est&#250;pida para deixarem de assumir a responsabilidade
</I>&gt;<i> por tornar seus sistemas de transa&#231;&#227;o eletr&#244;nica mais seguros. Afinal,
</I>&gt;<i> garantir a seguran&#231;a de dados custa dinheiro. E dinheiro &#233; o que os bancos
</I>&gt;<i> deram, coincidentemente, para a campanha a senador de Azeredo e muitos
</I>&gt;<i> outros deputados. Est&#227;o pouco ligando se v&#227;o emperrar o processo cultural ou
</I>&gt;<i> o avan&#231;o da inclus&#227;o digital no Brasil.
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of the day this is it: banks are trying to impose this stupid
</I>&gt;<i> law so that they don't have the responsibility for making their electronic
</I>&gt;<i> transaction systems more secure. After all, ensuring data security costs
</I>&gt;<i> money. And money is what the banks have, coincidentally, donated to Senator
</I>&gt;<i> Azeredo's and many other [politicians] campaigns. They don't care if it will
</I>&gt;<i> paralyse the cultural process or the enhancement of digital inclusion in
</I>&gt;<i> Brazil.
</I>&gt;<i> According to Jo&#227;o Carlos Carib&#233; [pt], this public hearing, virtually the
</I>&gt;<i> first open debate about the bill, was made possible through liaising by the
</I>&gt;<i> organizers of an online petition [pt] in defense of freedom and progress of
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge on the Brazilian Internet. It has been signed by over 121,400
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, which is not much, considering Brazil's nearly 200 million
</I>&gt;<i> population. Gabriel Sadoco [pt] writes about it at this Saturday's blog
</I>&gt;<i> carnival [pt] about politics and says that people should not be so apathetic
</I>&gt;<i> regarding this and others issues:
</I>&gt;<i> E a esses brasileiros que n&#227;o se incomodam com o que acontece no seu pa&#237;s.
</I>&gt;<i> Que preferem assistir as trag&#233;dias do jornal antes da novela das oito e s&#243;
</I>&gt;<i> servem pra fazer peso no mundo, acordem para a realidade e comecem a
</I>&gt;<i> protestar, porque voc&#234; ainda tem direito a isso. N&#227;o ao vigilantismo.
</I>&gt;<i> Privacidade e liberdade pra todo mundo!
</I>&gt;<i> For those Brazilians who do not care whatever happens in their country, who
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to read the tragedies in the newspaper before the eight o'clock soap
</I>&gt;<i> opera and are only good to put weight on the world, wake up to reality and
</I>&gt;<i> begin to protest, because you still have the right to do so. Say no to
</I>&gt;<i> surveillance. Privacy and freedom for everyone!
</I>&gt;<i> M&#225;rio Amaya [pt] has designed the poster that many bloggers have been
</I>&gt;<i> carrying with them, which can be downloaded and printed out. He is also the
</I>&gt;<i> designer of many of the online banners that have spread on the blogosphere.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kate X Messer's Young gay marriage activist leads national protests on 365
</I>&gt;<i> Gay profiles Seattle Amy Balliett, who started up the Join the Impact web
</I>&gt;<i> site after a blog post and email by her friend Willow Witte.  Amy's 26, and
</I>&gt;<i> her day job is as a search engine optimizer.  It's also an excellent history
</I>&gt;<i> of the start of the movement:
</I>&gt;<i> By Monday morning, a plan had emerged: Cities around the country would
</I>&gt;<i> organize their own efforts to coordinate a synchronized protest for Sat.,
</I>&gt;<i> Nov. 15, 10:30 a.m. PST. The movement became officially global with hits
</I>&gt;<i> from the UK and France, and by Nov. 11, over one million visitors had come
</I>&gt;<i> to the site.
</I>&gt;<i> Across the country, posts on Craigslist, bulletins on MySpace, and emails
</I>&gt;<i> on ListServs with titles like &quot;Meet at City Hall next weekend!&quot; and &quot;Upset
</I>&gt;<i> about Prop 8? Here's what YOU can do about it,&quot; began to buzz with notice of
</I>&gt;<i> the upcoming national protest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nancy Scola's Once a Local Legal Battle, Is Prop 8 On Its Way to
</I>&gt;<i> 'Net-Fueled Cultural Moment? on techPresident puts Join the Impact in
</I>&gt;<i> context: &quot;Its success is reminiscent of Columbia's anti-FARC movement
</I>&gt;<i> launched on Facebook that spawned protests all over the world.&quot;  Yeah,
</I>&gt;<i> really. jonpincus :: Join the Impact: taking social network activism (and
</I>&gt;<i> LGBTQ rights) to the next level I don't mean to slight the other LGBTQ
</I>&gt;<i> rights activism going on out there.  Equality Utah's brilliant idea of
</I>&gt;<i> reaching out to LDS leaders by taking them at their word and asking them to
</I>&gt;<i> co-sponsor civil unions in Utah presents the church with an opportunity.
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time the fiasco at the El Coyote press conference, the sticky
</I>&gt;<i> situation for Sundance, and the artistic director of the California's
</I>&gt;<i> largest musical theater stepping down in the wake of reaction to his $1000
</I>&gt;<i> donation (&quot;He said his sister is a lesbian in a domestic partnership, which
</I>&gt;<i> he understands to carry the same legal rights as marriage&quot;) all show the
</I>&gt;<i> strength of the various boycott movements.   Still, Join the Impact, with
</I>&gt;<i> its Wetpaint wiki and social network focus, is the one that has me most
</I>&gt;<i> excited.
</I>&gt;<i> In Towards a rebirth of freedom: activism on social networks back in July,
</I>&gt;<i> I suggested
</I>&gt;<i> The experiences from Get FISA Right and other social network activism
</I>&gt;<i> campaigns are much more broadly applicable.   As Cheryl Contee says, a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of people &quot;aren't as concerned about, say, FISA or impeachment. They want
</I>&gt;<i> jobs&quot; - or an end to wars and institutionalized violence, voting rights,
</I>&gt;<i> affordable food, different commencement speakers, marriage equality ....We
</I>&gt;<i> did a fairly good job of taking notes as we were going, and so hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> there's a lot for people to build on; still, there's much more to be said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  Observing the incredible organizing skill of the Millennials who
</I>&gt;<i> have grown up with these technologies it becomes abundantly clear how we
</I>&gt;<i> were just scratching the surface.  My reaction is consistently &quot;wow, that's
</I>&gt;<i> kind of how I'd have approached things but they've done it much much better
</I>&gt;<i> than I would have.&quot;  It starts with their positive and inclusive mission
</I>&gt;<i> statement; a brief excerpt:
</I>&gt;<i> Our movement seeks to encourage the LGBTQ community not to look towards the
</I>&gt;<i> past and place blame, but instead to look forward toward what needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> done now to achieve one goal: Full equality for ALL. We stand for reaching
</I>&gt;<i> out across all communities. We do not stand for bigotry, for scapegoating,
</I>&gt;<i> or using anger as our driving force. Our mission is to encourage our
</I>&gt;<i> community to engage our opposition in a conversation about full equality and
</I>&gt;<i> to do this with respect, dignity, and an attitude of outreach and education.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well said.  Then compare-and-contrast Get FISA Right's prototype
</I>&gt;<i> Fifty-state strategy and List of Senator-specific Facebook groups with Join
</I>&gt;<i> the Impact's main page (with a list of states + DC + International as well
</I>&gt;<i> as the navigation on the left), and individual cities -- complete with
</I>&gt;<i> embedded Google maps and links to Facebook groups.   Or check out their
</I>&gt;<i> Twitter update directing people to a customizable press release template.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be clear, I'm not dissing our accomplishments with Get FISA Right (GFR);
</I>&gt;<i> we prototyped approaches like the 50-state strategy and use of SaysMe.tv,
</I>&gt;<i> and GFR and the Voter Suppression Wiki together clearly had a big influence
</I>&gt;<i> on Wetpaint wiki activism.  We continue to be used as an example of the
</I>&gt;<i> power of social networks by people as diverse as Hillary Clinton's Internet
</I>&gt;<i> expert Peter Daou and Music for Democracy founder Bear Kittay, and with
</I>&gt;<i> discussions like What shoud Get FISA Right do now? starting up we're about
</I>&gt;<i> to test Ari Melber's and my theories about reactivating net movements.  More
</I>&gt;<i> on GFR soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Still, Join the Impact has taken things to another level, and as we go
</I>&gt;<i> ahead on GFR we'll be looking to them for inspiration.  It's not surprising:
</I>&gt;<i> for me, and the generally-older crowd that's been involed in Get FISA Right
</I>&gt;<i> and the Voter Suppression Wiki, social network sites are with rare
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions recently-learned behavior that typically isn't integrated fully
</I>&gt;<i> into our lives.  By contrast:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;For me it's second nature,&quot; says Balliett of social networking. &quot;It's my
</I>&gt;<i> job. I think: Need to organize an event? Use the Internet. Throw a party?
</I>&gt;<i> Use Evite. Technology offers a platform on which to hold the conversation.
</I>&gt;<i> It's also given a platform for us to rally together and organize.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said in email to a couple of folks my age, &quot;I feel old.  But in a good
</I>&gt;<i> way.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The Seattle protest's at Volunteer Park this Saturday. Festivities start at
</I>&gt;<i> 10:30 a.m., the rally and margh begins at noon, and there are speeches at
</I>&gt;<i> Westlake Center at 2.  See you there, I hope!  And if you're not in the
</I>&gt;<i> Seattle area, check out the wiki.  There's probably a protest near you.

</I>&gt;<i> U.S. gay marriage fight takes to the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Wed Nov 12, 2008 4:34pm ES
</I>&gt;<i> By Peter Henderson
</I>&gt;<i> SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The rejection of gay marriage by California
</I>&gt;<i> voters has unleashed a hurricane of protest on the Internet, with some
</I>&gt;<i> supporters venting their anger and others planning national demonstrations.
</I>&gt;<i> Amy Balliett, 26, used her lunch break last Friday to start a website --
</I>&gt;<i> www.jointheimpact.com -- to call for coordinated action across the United
</I>&gt;<i> States this weekend.
</I>&gt;<i> In a few days, more than 1 million people have visited her site and dozens
</I>&gt;<i> of marches and meetings are now planned for 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT) on
</I>&gt;<i> Saturday.
</I>&gt;<i> By the evening jointheimpact.com was created, it was visited 10,000 times.
</I>&gt;<i> By Sunday, there were 50,000 visits per hour and the computer running the
</I>&gt;<i> site crashed. It has moved computers twice since in an effort to keep up.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why do we have to wait for someone to step up and say let's do a protest?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Balliett remembered thinking after her friend, Willow Witte, posted a blog
</I>&gt;<i> about California. &quot;Over email we decided to do it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> California's Supreme Court opened the way to gay marriage in May, putting
</I>&gt;<i> it among a handful of states, provinces and European countries that allow
</I>&gt;<i> same-sex couples to marry.
</I>&gt;<i> But after a $70 million-plus campaign, a measure to ban gay marriage in
</I>&gt;<i> California passed in a vote held alongside the U.S. presidential and
</I>&gt;<i> congressional elections on November 4, stunning a community that had
</I>&gt;<i> expected its first major ballot box win.
</I>&gt;<i> Balliett's plan is to create an educational dialogue but others have
</I>&gt;<i> diverse goals or are simply speaking out as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, text
</I>&gt;<i> messages, blogs and websites buzz with protest about the vote in California.
</I>&gt;<i> Members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community say they
</I>&gt;<i> were hurt deeply and want to bring their civil rights argument -- that
</I>&gt;<i> same-sex couples deserve the same treatment as others -- to a national
</I>&gt;<i> audience.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It took the rights being taken away from people to really get across that
</I>&gt;<i> it's not a California issue. It's a nationwide issue,&quot; said Brandon
</I>&gt;<i> Williamson, who was about to start his own protest website when he found
</I>&gt;<i> Balliett's and joined forces as publicist.
</I>&gt;<i> 'IT'S MASSIVE'
</I>&gt;<i> Gay marriage is legal in two U.S. states, Massachusetts and Connecticut,
</I>&gt;<i> where court-approved same-sex weddings began on Wednesday. But dozens of
</I>&gt;<i> states have laws that limit marriage to a man and a woman.
</I>&gt;<i> This month's election also saw bans on gay marriage pass in Florida and
</I>&gt;<i> Arizona, while Arkansas stopped gay couples from adopting children.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the first time gay marriage proponents or their adversaries
</I>&gt;<i> have used technology. Both sides of California's Proposition 8, the gay
</I>&gt;<i> marriage ban, used websites and more.
</I>&gt;<i> But the ability of the Internet to organize grass-roots movements has been
</I>&gt;<i> especially clear since the ban's passage.
</I>&gt;<i> Balliett, whose job is publicizing websites through searches, says she has
</I>&gt;<i> never seen anything like it. Civil rights campaigners agree.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's massive,&quot; said Scott Robbe, a gay rights veteran based in Wisconsin,
</I>&gt;<i> adding that election campaigns from Howard Dean to Barack Obama had paved
</I>&gt;<i> the way for the civil rights movement to use the Internet on a massive
</I>&gt;<i> scale.
</I>&gt;<i> Balliett directs volunteer organizers to start MySpace and Facebook sites
</I>&gt;<i> for their own cities but the Internet action is about more than her efforts.
</I>&gt;<i> The Facebook group &quot;1,000,000 Million Strong Against Newly Passed Prop 8&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> has about 68,000 members, for instance. The group's creators identify
</I>&gt;<i> themselves as high school students.

</I>&gt;<i> Armenian bloggers protest destruction of Armenian churches in Georgia
</I>&gt;<i> 27.11.2008 17:59 GMT+04:00
</I>&gt;<i> /PanARMENIAN.Net/ Armenian bloggers gathered at the Georgian Embassy in
</I>&gt;<i> Yerevan today to demand that demolition of the Armenian cultural heritage be
</I>&gt;<i> stopped and those guilty be punished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The protesters were carrying posters of Norashen church and banners reading
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Save Armenian churches in Georgia&#8221;, &#8220;Republic of Georgia not Europe still
</I>&gt;<i> Asiatic&#8221; and a small coffin with an inscription &#8220;The newborn Georgian
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. This newborn democracy is dead already&#8221; on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is happening to Armenian churches in Georgia is nothing but genocide
</I>&gt;<i> of our cultural heritage, according to historian Samvel Karapetyan. A crime
</I>&gt;<i> has been committed and those guilty should be punished by the international
</I>&gt;<i> court, he said yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over 650 Armenian churches are situated in the territory of Georgia, most
</I>&gt;<i> of them already appropriated or destructed by the Georgian side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On November 16, Georgian monk Tariel Sikinchelashvili instructed workers to
</I>&gt;<i> raze to the ground the graves of Mikhail and Lidia Tamamshevs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This barbarian act outraged Armenians, who demanded to let the graves in
</I>&gt;<i> their place. However, Father Tariel responded with harsh statements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Upon arrival of representatives of the Armenian Apostolic Church and
</I>&gt;<i> parliament member Van Bayburt, the Georgian monk said he just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the gravestones to &#8220;clean under them.&#8221;

</I>&gt;<i> Internet cafe users to verify identity
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jakarta Post - November 22, 2008
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jakarta -- Head of Indonesian Internet Cafe
</I>&gt;<i> Association's Supervisory Body Judith Monique said
</I>&gt;<i> Saturday the government should require all internet
</I>&gt;<i> services users to verify their identity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There needs to be a log for users, such as a guest
</I>&gt;<i> book, at every warnet (internet cafe) so as to
</I>&gt;<i> provide investigators with leads whenever
</I>&gt;<i> cybercrime surfaces,&quot; Monique said, as quoted by
</I>&gt;<i> Antara news agency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The National Police Cybercrime Unit head Edy
</I>&gt;<i> Hartono concurred, adding that the police had
</I>&gt;<i> already planned on ordering internet cafe owners to
</I>&gt;<i> set up user logs with detailed identity
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;To date, most internet cafe operators only
</I>&gt;<i> register net billing information and user IDs.
</I>&gt;<i> Since these can be easily manipulated, it creates a
</I>&gt;<i> conducive environment for criminals,&quot; Hartono said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He added that the police had stepped up measures in
</I>&gt;<i> publicizing the 2008 Law on Information and
</I>&gt;<i> Electronic Transactions (ITE), particularly among
</I>&gt;<i> the internet provider community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to legal expert Edmon Makarim, the ITE
</I>&gt;<i> law allows easier access for the police in
</I>&gt;<i> investigating cybercrimes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Under the ITE, digital evidences are deemed valid
</I>&gt;<i> in any investigation of alleged internet misuse,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Makarim said.

</I>&gt;<i> Kenya bans mobile phones to stem school riots
</I>&gt;<i> Posted Wed Jul 23, 2008 7:43am AEST
</I>&gt;<i> The Kenyan Government has banned the use of mobile phones in schools in a
</I>&gt;<i> bid to stem a string of deadly riots that have rocked the country.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I am banning the use of mobile phones by our students in our schools,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Education Minister Sam Ongeri told parliament.
</I>&gt;<i> The ban, which takes effect immediately, comes a day after police charged
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of students with arson after weekend riots that left at least one
</I>&gt;<i> student dead and several injured.
</I>&gt;<i> Officers charged several students on Monday over the burning down of
</I>&gt;<i> hostels and other violence that had shut down 20 secondary schools across
</I>&gt;<i> the country, said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We will continue arresting the students for the crimes they commit,&quot; said
</I>&gt;<i> Mr Kiraithe.
</I>&gt;<i> More than 300 secondary schools have gone on strike in Kenya over the past
</I>&gt;<i> month, while students have destroyed properties worth millions of shillings
</I>&gt;<i> as they protest poor living conditions and bad management.
</I>&gt;<i> Mr Ongeri said mobile phones had been used to coordinate the riots, which
</I>&gt;<i> he blamed on widespread political incitement and drug abuse.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We cannot afford careless actions; we cannot afford a carefree attitude.
</I>&gt;<i> If we don't have discipline in our schools, life will be chaotic,&quot; he told
</I>&gt;<i> reporters.

</I>&gt;<i> Protest Leading Fugitive Arrested in Seoul
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OCTOBER 20, 2008 08:44
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A deputy leader of an online community against President Lee Myung-bak was
</I>&gt;<i> arrested yesterday on the charge of leading illegal street demonstrations.
</I>&gt;<i> Baek Eun-jong, 55, was apprehended by the Jongno Police Station in Seoul.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;We arrested Baek yesterday,&quot; a police spokesman said. &quot;He had been hiding
</I>&gt;<i> in the (Buddhist) Jogye Temple for more than 100 days. We will send him to
</I>&gt;<i> an arraignment hearing for his involvement in illegal protests.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> To evade police, Baek sought safety at the temple on July 5, along with
</I>&gt;<i> fellow fugitives. He ventured out Saturday to join a demonstration at
</I>&gt;<i> Cheonggye Plaza and got arrested.
</I>&gt;<i> The goal of the street protest, meanwhile, changed from blasting U.S. beef
</I>&gt;<i> imports to urging action on the economic downturn. Over the last two months,
</I>&gt;<i> they had not held a rally.
</I>&gt;<i> A total of 1,100 members of leftist groups held a demonstration at the
</I>&gt;<i> plaza Saturday, criticizing the Lee administration for the national economic
</I>&gt;<i> crisis. They said recent tax cuts will help only the top one percent of the
</I>&gt;<i> income bracket and blasted the police crackdown on protestors as
</I>&gt;<i> undemocratic.
</I>&gt;<i> Authorities said the latest protest was an overture for continuing
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrations to topple the administration by highlighting the hobbling
</I>&gt;<i> economy. The protesters plan to launch a new organization this coming
</I>&gt;<i> Saturday.

</I>&gt;<i> South Korea jails man for internet lies during beef protests
</I>&gt;<i> 23 Oct 2008, 0910 hrs IST, AFP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SEOUL: A South Korean court has jailed a man who spread false Internet
</I>&gt;<i> rumours that police raped a demonstrator during protests against US beef
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> imports, officials said on Thursday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the latest legal action against Internet rumour mongers during the
</I>&gt;<i> protests, court officials said the man was sentenced to 10 months in prison
</I>&gt;<i> plus two years' probation and ordered to perform 160 hours of community
</I>&gt;<i> service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The court said the man used a fake identity to join a website and posted
</I>&gt;<i> two articles alleging police had raped one participant in the protests,
</I>&gt;<i> which rocked the country a few months ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;He was fully aware that his post was untrue, but he even went so far as to
</I>&gt;<i> fabricate pictures to support the false argument, posing a great danger to
</I>&gt;<i> society,&quot; the court said in its judgement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Internet postings fuelled the mass protests, which began in May after Seoul
</I>&gt;<i> lifted a ban on US beef imports. The ban had been imposed in 2003 over fears
</I>&gt;<i> the meat was infected with mad cow disease.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rallies died down after Seoul negotiated extra safety conditions for
</I>&gt;<i> the imports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Courts have punished several groups and individuals for breaking the law in
</I>&gt;<i> various ways during the sometimes violent rallies. The demonstrations took
</I>&gt;<i> on an anti-government flavour and rocked the administration of President Lee
</I>&gt;<i> Myung-Bak.

</I>&gt;<i> COLOMBIA:      PRINT PAGE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  AUTHORITIES SUPPRESS COVERAGE OF INDIGENOUS PROTESTS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least one person was killed and more than 130 were wounded during
</I>&gt;<i> indigenous demonstrations last week in several departments in Colombia. But
</I>&gt;<i> with multiple press freedom violations being committed, you would be
</I>&gt;<i> hard-pressed to find out what's going on.
</I>&gt;<i> Indigenous community media groups in the department of Cauca complained
</I>&gt;<i> recently that several of their websites have been blocked, and a local
</I>&gt;<i> community radio station has reported suspicious power outages - at a time
</I>&gt;<i> when indigenous communities have been protesting to protect their
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental rights, reports the Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), IFEX
</I>&gt;<i> member in Colombia.
</I>&gt;<i> Thousands of indigenous Colombians, mainly in the southwest and northwest,
</I>&gt;<i> mobilised last week on a five-point plan. It calls for the reestablishment
</I>&gt;<i> of their territorial rights as laid out by the Inter-American Commission on
</I>&gt;<i> Human Rights, and rallies against the Colombian free-trade deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> U.S., Canada and the EU and the increasing militarisation of the country by
</I>&gt;<i> the government and paramilitaries.
</I>&gt;<i> As part of the protests, indigenous groups blocked several roads last week,
</I>&gt;<i> including the Pan-American Highway, the country's main north-south
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughfare, in at least four locations between Colombia's third largest
</I>&gt;<i> city, Cali, and the city of Popay&#225;n, 135 kilometres to the south.
</I>&gt;<i> But they were met with a repressive response. Violent clashes broke out
</I>&gt;<i> between protesters and security officers on 14 and 15 October, when officers
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to reopen the highway, allegedly firing into the crowds and
</I>&gt;<i> assaulting them with tear gas and hand grenades. According to the National
</I>&gt;<i> Indigenous Organisation of Colombia (ONIC), the clashes have resulted in one
</I>&gt;<i> death and more than 130 people injured, many gravely.
</I>&gt;<i> On the same day, the websites of the Association of Indigenous Councils of
</I>&gt;<i> Northern Cauca (ACIN) and the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council (CRIC), two
</I>&gt;<i> of the main organisations that have been mobilising through their own media
</I>&gt;<i> channels, went out of service, reports FLIP.
</I>&gt;<i> CRIC told FLIP that its website was down for more than 12 hours until staff
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily transferred it to another server. CRIC said, &quot;It's very
</I>&gt;<i> coincidental that the website crashed at exactly the same time that the
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrations began.&quot; The websites of both CRIC and ACIN have previously
</I>&gt;<i> been down during demonstrations.
</I>&gt;<i> Several radio stations had their power cut while they were broadcasting
</I>&gt;<i> information about the demonstrations. La Libertad radio station, based in
</I>&gt;<i> the municipality of Totor&#243;, says power outages are common in the area.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;However, it appears suspicious to us because this has happened several
</I>&gt;<i> times when we are broadcasting this type of information,&quot; La Libertad said.
</I>&gt;<i> Sources in Cauca told FLIP that they believe the obstruction of the
</I>&gt;<i> independent media outlets may be aimed at preventing the dissemination of
</I>&gt;<i> allegations of excessive use of force by security forces during the
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrations.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, journalists who have been covering the demonstrations have
</I>&gt;<i> expressed concern over their safety. &quot;We are in the line of fire,&quot; one
</I>&gt;<i> journalist told FLIP.
</I>&gt;<i> According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), foreign journalists have been
</I>&gt;<i> stopped and questioned and even expelled for &quot;taking part in political
</I>&gt;<i> activities&quot;. Julien Dubois, a French journalist planning to document the
</I>&gt;<i> protests in Cauca Valley, was detained on 13 October, expelled the next day
</I>&gt;<i> and banned from Colombia for five years.
</I>&gt;<i> Colombia has a long tradition of community, citizen-based media projects
</I>&gt;<i> that consistently present an alternative narrative to the corporate media.
</I>&gt;<i> They are linked to a broader network of national, alternative media (such as
</I>&gt;<i> Indymedia-Colombia and SICO, among others). But as concluded at
</I>&gt;<i> International PEN's recent World Congress in Bogot&#225;, their perspectives are
</I>&gt;<i> rarely heard through mainstream channels, which often give an unfiltered
</I>&gt;<i> voice to the official authorities.
</I>&gt;<i> The mass media have been mainly echoing the government's perspective: that
</I>&gt;<i> the protests have been infiltrated by &quot;destabilising forces&quot; - the
</I>&gt;<i> Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The accusations have been
</I>&gt;<i> denied by protesters.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The (&#193;lvaro) Uribe government continues to make the unsubstantiated link
</I>&gt;<i> in an attempt to avoid any dialogue with the communities. This fact does not
</I>&gt;<i> come through in any of the coverage whatsoever, leaving the audience in a
</I>&gt;<i> permanent state of being misinformed,&quot; said Mario A. Murillo, a respected
</I>&gt;<i> professor at Hofstra University in New York, who has been documenting the
</I>&gt;<i> protests on his blog in Colombia.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The government's claims... have almost become conventional wisdom in the
</I>&gt;<i> last few days because of the capacity of the Uribe administration to set the
</I>&gt;<i> agenda, present its arguments to domestic journalists with indignation and
</I>&gt;<i> authority, and come off as the victim once again,&quot; he added.
</I>&gt;<i> In some respects, the indigenous groups have defied the odds and have been
</I>&gt;<i> successful in gathering support on an international level, and getting other
</I>&gt;<i> rights groups to take notice. An open letter demanding an international
</I>&gt;<i> mission go to Colombia, addressed to Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper,
</I>&gt;<i> has already garnered more than 150 signatures, including some from Canada's
</I>&gt;<i> First Nations groups.
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, at least 12,000 indigenous people started a march from La
</I>&gt;<i> Maria, Cauca to Cali on 21 October to continue to pressure President Uribe
</I>&gt;<i> to address their concerns. They have vowed to continue marching to Bogot&#225; if
</I>&gt;<i> he doesn't show. Despite talks over the weekend with three ministers and the
</I>&gt;<i> promise by Uribe to buy land for the indigenous peoples, there was no deal
</I>&gt;<i> made between them and the government.
</I>&gt;<i> The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) recalls that the
</I>&gt;<i> protests occur within a general context of grave, systematic and repeated
</I>&gt;<i> violations of the rights of indigenous peoples in Colombia. According to
</I>&gt;<i> FIDH, in the last month, 29 indigenous persons were killed in the country,
</I>&gt;<i> and over the past six years more than 1,240 indigenous persons have been
</I>&gt;<i> murdered and at least 53,885 displaced.

</I>&gt;<i> Breaking: Colombia: Indigenous Protests and Murders Under Media Blackout
</I>&gt;<i> By Juliana Rinc&#243;n Parra
</I>&gt;<i> Oct 23, 2008, 19:48
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From Colombia, the indigenous groups in the Cauca department have made an
</I>&gt;<i> international SOS to call attention on their plight. They accuse the armed
</I>&gt;<i> forces of opening fire with live ammunition during their marches along the
</I>&gt;<i> main highways in the country, killing and injuring indigenous protesters.
</I>&gt;<i> The government keeps stating that the live fire comes from indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> members or confabulated guerrilla infiltrated within the armed forces to
</I>&gt;<i> create chaos, and calling these protesters terrorists. The indigenous groups
</I>&gt;<i> are marching to ask, among other things, for justice for the thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> Indigenous Colombian people murdered in the past years, including community
</I>&gt;<i> leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From Colombia, the indigenous groups in the Cauca department have made an
</I>&gt;<i> international SOS to call attention on their plight. On their website,
</I>&gt;<i> cric-colombia.org they explain how they have been protesting the human
</I>&gt;<i> rights abuses they have been victim of, represented by the murder of one of
</I>&gt;<i> their community leaders by hit men and the death threats on other regional
</I>&gt;<i> and community leaders and spokespeople. They have requested a public
</I>&gt;<i> audience with the Government Officials, and have been protesting since
</I>&gt;<i> October 12, demanding the protection of their human rights and making the
</I>&gt;<i> government live up to the promises of the signed treaties of the past.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is said that armed government forces,  have shot live ammunition
</I>&gt;<i> at the protesters, leaving 2 dead and more than 60 indigenous members
</I>&gt;<i> injured. On this blog post on the indigenous community site they show
</I>&gt;<i> pictures of the protest and the injuries some have sustained as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> list of those injured up to October 14th. On October 15th, the armed forces
</I>&gt;<i> opened fire once again on the protesters, killing one and leaving 39
</I>&gt;<i> injured. They have also blocked the roads and ambulances can't get in to
</I>&gt;<i> help those who are hurt and needing assistance. (Links in Spanish unless
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise noted)
</I>&gt;<i> They write:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;la fuerza publica entr&#243; disparando con armas de largo alcance y ya hay 3
</I>&gt;<i> heridos mas de gravedad. la fuerza militar entro ya al territorio de dialogo
</I>&gt;<i> y negociaci&#243;n.
</I>&gt;<i> Se solicita de manera urgente que organismos internacionales frenen esta
</I>&gt;<i> violencia. tambien a los pueblos inigenas que refuercen el personal que esta
</I>&gt;<i> siendo atacado.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The armed forces came in shooting with long range weapons and there are
</I>&gt;<i> already 3 other persons seriously injured. The military forces have barged
</I>&gt;<i> into the territory of dialogue and negotiation.
</I>&gt;<i> We urgently request international organizations to stop this violence. Also
</I>&gt;<i> for the indigenous communities to get more people to back those who have
</I>&gt;<i> been attacked.
</I>&gt;<i> The indigenous community has been sending emails and posting on their
</I>&gt;<i> website[es] updates on the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> The following video was posted last week by user nasacin, including
</I>&gt;<i> cellphone and video camera images from the manifestations, clips showing
</I>&gt;<i> shot indigenous community members, a soldier speaking about the differences
</I>&gt;<i> between the Mob Control ESMAD and the armed forces, stating that the armed
</I>&gt;<i> forces are to keep the peace, and the ESMAD is the one in charge of defusing
</I>&gt;<i> violent situations. However, when asked who it is that is shooting with
</I>&gt;<i> rifles, the soldier doesn't answer.
</I>&gt;<i> Blogger Alejandro Pel&#225;ez last week wrote of how foreign media is reporting
</I>&gt;<i> on the indigenous protests, but local media hadn't published anything at
</I>&gt;<i> all:
</I>&gt;<i> Las noticias son hechos, y para escribir sobre hechos toca salir del
</I>&gt;<i> escritorio, entrevistar personas, buscar en archivos, viajar al monte . Las
</I>&gt;<i> masacres, por ejemplo, son hechos. Pero en este pa&#237;s los medios cubren este
</I>&gt;<i> tipo de hechos con diez a&#241;os de diferencia y ah&#237; ya no son noticia, son
</I>&gt;<i> historia. En este momento, como lo cuenta AdamIsacson (s&#237;, un gringo
</I>&gt;<i> sentando en Washington D.C.), hay serios disturbios en el Cauca y El Tiempo
</I>&gt;<i> ni lo anota. Tal vez presenten una cr&#243;nica complet&#237;sima dentro de diez a&#241;os.
</I>&gt;<i> Ch&#233;vere.
</I>&gt;<i> News is facts, and to write about facts you have to get out from behind
</I>&gt;<i> your desk, interview people, search the archives, head out into the
</I>&gt;<i> mountains. Massacres, for example, are facts. But in this country the media
</I>&gt;<i> covers this type of events with a 10 year difference when they are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> a news story, but history. In this moment, as Adam Isacson (yes, a gringo
</I>&gt;<i> sitting in Washington D.C.) reports, there are serious disturbances in the
</I>&gt;<i> Cauca, and El Tiempo doesn't even have a note on it.  Maybe they'll present
</I>&gt;<i> a full chronicle of it in ten years. Great.
</I>&gt;<i> In Gacetilla Colombiana, a Digg style application for Colombian news,
</I>&gt;<i> posters have been linking foreign news as an alternative for those who are
</I>&gt;<i> under the &#8220;media blackout&#8221; on this event, in particular to a major foreign
</I>&gt;<i> news chain's video [en] where a citizen media recording shows what could be
</I>&gt;<i> an armed but hooded person dressed in green with a rifle going moving
</I>&gt;<i> through the mob squad and shooting at the indigenous protesters as the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the mob squad move to let him pass. In the blog &#8220;Lets Change the
</I>&gt;<i> World&#8221;, Decio Machado posts the email chain sent out by the Indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> groups, the means through which most Colombians have found out about the

</I>&gt;<i> Breaking: Colombia: Indigenous Protests and Murders Under Media Blackout
</I>&gt;<i> By Juliana Rinc&#243;n Parra
</I>&gt;<i> Oct 23, 2008, 19:48
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From Colombia, the indigenous groups in the Cauca department have made an
</I>&gt;<i> international SOS to call attention on their plight. They accuse the armed
</I>&gt;<i> forces of opening fire with live ammunition during their marches along the
</I>&gt;<i> main highways in the country, killing and injuring indigenous protesters.
</I>&gt;<i> The government keeps stating that the live fire comes from indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> members or confabulated guerrilla infiltrated within the armed forces to
</I>&gt;<i> create chaos, and calling these protesters terrorists. The indigenous groups
</I>&gt;<i> are marching to ask, among other things, for justice for the thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> Indigenous Colombian people murdered in the past years, including community
</I>&gt;<i> leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From Colombia, the indigenous groups in the Cauca department have made an
</I>&gt;<i> international SOS to call attention on their plight. On their website,
</I>&gt;<i> cric-colombia.org they explain how they have been protesting the human
</I>&gt;<i> rights abuses they have been victim of, represented by the murder of one of
</I>&gt;<i> their community leaders by hit men and the death threats on other regional
</I>&gt;<i> and community leaders and spokespeople. They have requested a public
</I>&gt;<i> audience with the Government Officials, and have been protesting since
</I>&gt;<i> October 12, demanding the protection of their human rights and making the
</I>&gt;<i> government live up to the promises of the signed treaties of the past.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is said that armed government forces,  have shot live ammunition
</I>&gt;<i> at the protesters, leaving 2 dead and more than 60 indigenous members
</I>&gt;<i> injured. On this blog post on the indigenous community site they show
</I>&gt;<i> pictures of the protest and the injuries some have sustained as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> list of those injured up to October 14th. On October 15th, the armed forces
</I>&gt;<i> opened fire once again on the protesters, killing one and leaving 39
</I>&gt;<i> injured. They have also blocked the roads and ambulances can't get in to
</I>&gt;<i> help those who are hurt and needing assistance. (Links in Spanish unless
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise noted)
</I>&gt;<i> They write:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;la fuerza publica entr&#243; disparando con armas de largo alcance y ya hay 3
</I>&gt;<i> heridos mas de gravedad. la fuerza militar entro ya al territorio de dialogo
</I>&gt;<i> y negociaci&#243;n.
</I>&gt;<i> Se solicita de manera urgente que organismos internacionales frenen esta
</I>&gt;<i> violencia. tambien a los pueblos inigenas que refuercen el personal que esta
</I>&gt;<i> siendo atacado.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The armed forces came in shooting with long range weapons and there are
</I>&gt;<i> already 3 other persons seriously injured. The military forces have barged
</I>&gt;<i> into the territory of dialogue and negotiation.
</I>&gt;<i> We urgently request international organizations to stop this violence. Also
</I>&gt;<i> for the indigenous communities to get more people to back those who have
</I>&gt;<i> been attacked.
</I>&gt;<i> The indigenous community has been sending emails and posting on their
</I>&gt;<i> website[es] updates on the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> The following video was posted last week by user nasacin, including
</I>&gt;<i> cellphone and video camera images from the manifestations, clips showing
</I>&gt;<i> shot indigenous community members, a soldier speaking about the differences
</I>&gt;<i> between the Mob Control ESMAD and the armed forces, stating that the armed
</I>&gt;<i> forces are to keep the peace, and the ESMAD is the one in charge of defusing
</I>&gt;<i> violent situations. However, when asked who it is that is shooting with
</I>&gt;<i> rifles, the soldier doesn't answer.
</I>&gt;<i> Blogger Alejandro Pel&#225;ez last week wrote of how foreign media is reporting
</I>&gt;<i> on the indigenous protests, but local media hadn't published anything at
</I>&gt;<i> all:
</I>&gt;<i> Las noticias son hechos, y para escribir sobre hechos toca salir del
</I>&gt;<i> escritorio, entrevistar personas, buscar en archivos, viajar al monte . Las
</I>&gt;<i> masacres, por ejemplo, son hechos. Pero en este pa&#237;s los medios cubren este
</I>&gt;<i> tipo de hechos con diez a&#241;os de diferencia y ah&#237; ya no son noticia, son
</I>&gt;<i> historia. En este momento, como lo cuenta AdamIsacson (s&#237;, un gringo
</I>&gt;<i> sentando en Washington D.C.), hay serios disturbios en el Cauca y El Tiempo
</I>&gt;<i> ni lo anota. Tal vez presenten una cr&#243;nica complet&#237;sima dentro de diez a&#241;os.
</I>&gt;<i> Ch&#233;vere.
</I>&gt;<i> News is facts, and to write about facts you have to get out from behind
</I>&gt;<i> your desk, interview people, search the archives, head out into the
</I>&gt;<i> mountains. Massacres, for example, are facts. But in this country the media
</I>&gt;<i> covers this type of events with a 10 year difference when they are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> a news story, but history. In this moment, as Adam Isacson (yes, a gringo
</I>&gt;<i> sitting in Washington D.C.) reports, there are serious disturbances in the
</I>&gt;<i> Cauca, and El Tiempo doesn't even have a note on it.  Maybe they'll present
</I>&gt;<i> a full chronicle of it in ten years. Great.
</I>&gt;<i> In Gacetilla Colombiana, a Digg style application for Colombian news,
</I>&gt;<i> posters have been linking foreign news as an alternative for those who are
</I>&gt;<i> under the &#8220;media blackout&#8221; on this event, in particular to a major foreign
</I>&gt;<i> news chain's video [en] where a citizen media recording shows what could be
</I>&gt;<i> an armed but hooded person dressed in green with a rifle going moving
</I>&gt;<i> through the mob squad and shooting at the indigenous protesters as the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the mob squad move to let him pass. In the blog &#8220;Lets Change the
</I>&gt;<i> World&#8221;, Decio Machado posts the email chain sent out by the Indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> groups, the means through which most Colombians have found out about the
</I>&gt;<i> crisis.  The Selvas.org blog also posts updates on the situation, how
</I>&gt;<i> indigenous groups are all marching towards a main city called Cali and

</I>&gt;<i> Update: McCain protests YouTube's removal of his campaign videos
</I>&gt;<i> GOP candidate says YouTube acted too quickly to comply with copyright
</I>&gt;<i> notices that are 'without merit'
</I>&gt;<i> By Heather Havenstein
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> October 15, 2008 (Computerworld) Republican presidential candidate John
</I>&gt;<i> McCain is accusing YouTube LLC of acting too quickly to comply with
</I>&gt;<i> copyright infringement notices by yanking his campaign videos.
</I>&gt;<i> McCain's campaign sent a letter Monday to YouTube parent company Google
</I>&gt;<i> Inc., protesting YouTube's removal of unnamed videos from the site after
</I>&gt;<i> receiving take-down notices claiming copyright infringement under the
</I>&gt;<i> Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The McCain camp goes on to suggest
</I>&gt;<i> that YouTube set up a special process for reviewing the legal merit of
</I>&gt;<i> take-down requests for YouTube accounts associated with candidates or their
</I>&gt;<i> campaigns.
</I>&gt;<i> The letter asserts that numerous times during the campaign, YouTube removed
</I>&gt;<i> videos that do not violate the DMCA, but instead are examples of fair use of
</I>&gt;<i> material because the videos included less than 10 seconds of footage from
</I>&gt;<i> news broadcasts. The use of material from news broadcasts is protected as
</I>&gt;<i> fair use under the DMCA, McCain's letter claims, because the videos are
</I>&gt;<i> noncommercial uses of the material, the material is factual and brief, and
</I>&gt;<i> the videos don't affect the market for the allegedly infringed material.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Overreaching copyright claims have resulted in the removal of
</I>&gt;<i> noninfringing campaign videos from YouTube, thus silencing political
</I>&gt;<i> speech,&quot; according to the letter.
</I>&gt;<i> Despite the &quot;complete lack of merit in these copyright claims,&quot; YouTube has
</I>&gt;<i> removed McCain's campaign videos immediately upon receipt of the take-down
</I>&gt;<i> notices, the letter goes on to note.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It is unfortunate because it deprives the public of the ability to freely
</I>&gt;<i> and easily view and discuss the most popular political videos of the day,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> according to the letter. &quot;Nothing in the DMCA requires a host like YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> to comply automatically with the take-down notices, while blinding itself
</I>&gt;<i> from their legal merit.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The McCain campaign went on to propose that YouTube commit to a full legal
</I>&gt;<i> review of all take-down notices on videos posted from accounts controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> political campaigns and candidates.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Surely, the protection of core political speech and the protection of the
</I>&gt;<i> central role of YouTube has come to play in the country's political
</I>&gt;<i> discourse is worth the small amount of additional legal work our proposal
</I>&gt;<i> would require.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In a letter sent yesterday to the McCain campaign, YouTube said that
</I>&gt;<i> performing a substantial legal review of every DMCA take-down notice that it
</I>&gt;<i> receives is not a &quot;viable solution.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> It is not possible because of the scale of YouTube's operations, the letter
</I>&gt;<i> said. &quot;Any such review would have to include a determination of whether a
</I>&gt;<i> particular use is a 'fair use' under the law, which is a complex and
</I>&gt;<i> fact-specific test that requires the subjective balancing of four factors,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> the letter said. &quot;No number of lawyers could determine with a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> level of certainty whether all the videos for which we receive disputed
</I>&gt;<i> take-down notices qualify as fair use.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, YouTube does not have the required information about the
</I>&gt;<i> content in user-uploaded videos, such as the source of the content and
</I>&gt;<i> ownership rights, to make the determination as to whether a take-down notice
</I>&gt;<i> includes a valid claim of infringement, YouTube said.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Moreover, while we agree with you that the U.S. presidential
</I>&gt;<i> election-related content is invaluable and worthy of the highest level of
</I>&gt;<i> protection, there is a lot of other content on our global site that our
</I>&gt;<i> users around the world find to be equally important, including by way of
</I>&gt;<i> example only political campaigns from around the globe at all levels of
</I>&gt;<i> government, human rights movements and other important voices. We try to be
</I>&gt;<i> careful not to favor one category of content on our site over others.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Mike Masnick, president and CEO of IT research firm Techdirt, noted that it
</I>&gt;<i> is rare to see politicians delving into the fair use issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is impressive and somewhat unexpected,&quot; he noted in a blog post.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's certainly not an issue you'd expect to see raised by a presidential
</I>&gt;<i> candidate (of either party). I'm sure the McCain campaign recognizes that
</I>&gt;<i> YouTube is completely within its legal rights to automatically pull down the
</I>&gt;<i> content, but in sending this letter the campaign is suggesting that,
</I>&gt;<i> specific to videos put up by either political campaign (the letter cc's the
</I>&gt;<i> Obama campaign), that YouTube take into account fair use.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> He further noted that the real issue has nothing to do with Google or
</I>&gt;<i> YouTube, but in the way the DMCA itself is structured.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Since it provides clear safe harbor for a recipient of a take-down notice
</I>&gt;<i> if they take down the content, it's a reasonable business decision to simply
</I>&gt;<i> take down the content and then follow the proper procedures for letting the
</I>&gt;<i> uploader file a response notice,&quot; Masnick wrote. &quot;While it certainly would
</I>&gt;<i> be nice for YouTube to take into account fair use before deciding whether or
</I>&gt;<i> not to pull down the content, the real problem is with the law itself, and
</I>&gt;<i> the incentives it puts in place for any recipient of such a letter.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> He suggested that McCain or Democratic candidate Barack Obama push to have
</I>&gt;<i> the legislation changed so that DMCA explicitly notes that recipients of
</I>&gt;<i> take-down notices can keep their protection under fair use if they refuse to
</I>&gt;<i> take down content because they believe the content in question is a fair use
</I>&gt;<i> of the material.
</I>&gt;<i> The DMCA has taken center stage in the $1 billion copyright infringement
</I>&gt;<i> lawsuit filed against Google by Viacom last year alleging that YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> violates Viacom's copyrights by showing unauthorized video clips.
</I>&gt;<i> President Bush signed into law yesterday a bill aimed at bolstering
</I>&gt;<i> protection of intellectual property like software, films and music by
</I>&gt;<i> raising penalties for infringement and creating a national &quot;IP czar.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Taiwan: An online protest against the American Institute in Taiwan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thursday, October 16th, 2008 @ 08:26 UTC
</I>&gt;<i> In September, Taiwanese artist Chen Chieh-jen started a website against the
</I>&gt;<i> American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) called, &#8220;I suspect that you intend to
</I>&gt;<i> stow away to the U.S.&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i> When he was invited to attend New Orleans Biennial, he went to the AIT to
</I>&gt;<i> apply for a U.S. non-immigrant visa (business/tourist visa) at 12:45pm on
</I>&gt;<i> September 23, 2008. When he delivered his application documents, he was told
</I>&gt;<i> that there was an error in his document. He asked what the error was, but
</I>&gt;<i> the officer yelled at him arrogantly, &#8220;Come here! Do you want to argue with
</I>&gt;<i> me? I suspect that you intend to stow away to the U.S.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> After the accident, he left the AIT and claimed,
</I>&gt;<i> &#25105;&#30070;&#28982;&#35201;&#25298;&#32085;&#34987;&#36889;&#27171;&#30340;&#32670;&#36785;&#65292;&#26356;&#19981;&#26371;&#20877;&#21435;&#30003;&#35531;&#32654;&#22283;&#31805;&#35657;&#12290;
</I>&gt;<i> I surely reject this kind of humiliation, and I will never apply for a U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> visa again.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, he invited others to share their experience if they faced a
</I>&gt;<i> similar situation. He said,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#25105;&#30456;&#20449;&#36889;&#20491;&#19990;&#30028;&#32317;&#26159;&#34987;&#40670;&#40670;&#28404;&#28404;&#30340;&#32233;&#24930;&#25913;&#35722;&#65292;&#25105;&#35488;&#25711;&#22320;&#36992;&#35531;&#26377;&#39006;&#20284;&#32147;&#39511;&#30340;&#20154;&#65292;&#28961;&#35542;&#26159;&#35242;&#36523;&#32147;&#27511;&#12289;&#36523;&#26049;&#26379;&#21451;&#30340;&#32147;&#39511;&#65292;&#25110;&#26159;&#20320;&#26366;&#30446;&#25802;&#30340;&#36942;&#31243;&#65292;&#37117;&#24076;&#26395;&#20320;&#33021;&#22312;&#36889;&#20491;&#37096;&#33853;&#26684;&#19978;&#30041;&#19979;&#20320;&#30340;&#35211;&#35657;&#12290;&#30070;&#36889;&#35377;&#35377;&#22810;&#22810;&#30340;&#32147;&#39511;&#32858;&#38598;&#36215;&#20358;&#26178;&#65292;&#25110;&#35377;&#33021;&#24171;&#21161;&#25105;&#20497;&#24819;&#65306;&#25105;&#20497;&#28858;&#20160;&#40636;&#26371;&#34987;&#22914;&#27492;&#23565;&#24453;&#65311;&#25105;&#20497;&#21487;&#20197;&#22914;&#20309;&#25913;&#35722;&#23427;&#65311;
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this world will be changed slowly, little by little. I sincerely
</I>&gt;<i> invited people who have has a similar experience, either your own experience
</I>&gt;<i> or your friends' experience or what you have seen, to write down your
