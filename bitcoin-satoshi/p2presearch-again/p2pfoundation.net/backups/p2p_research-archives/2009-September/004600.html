Controversial RU staff clash with police
RU Correspondent

At least 10 'controversially-appointed' fourth-class employees of
Rajshahi University (RU) were injured in a clash between police and
employees in second day of the indefinite strike on the campus yesterday.

Earlier, around 200 fourth-class employees of RU enforced an indefinite
strike on the campus wearing shrouds demanding regularisation of their jobs.

The employees were preparing to burn the effigy of RU acting vice
chancellor. On information, law enforcers rushed to the spot and tried
to snatch away the effigy.

At one stage, the police locked in a clash with the angry employees.

JNTU teachers stage demonstration
Staff Reporter
Kakinada: The Teachers&#8217; Association of JNTU College of Engineering,
Kakinada staged a demonstration in front of the University&#8217;s Central
Administrative Building here on Saturday protesting against the delay in
releasing the quarterly block grants and demanded unconditional option
for all employees to choose the place of postings, transfer of budgeted
posts to the college and additional funds for development.
In a memorandum submitted to the registrar, association president P.
Subba Rao and secretary R. Srinivasa Rao stated that the JNTU, Kakinada
was given block grant only for the first quarter of this year against
the norm of releasing it in four quarterly instalments.
This inordinate delay was hampering the development and maintenance of
University and it might cause late payment of salaries and pensions.

Jury Rules in Favor of Ward Churchill, While the Media Rules Against Him
April 3, 2009 by strongwindsahead
In the case of Ward Churchill vs. CU Boulder, the jury ruled in favor of
American Indian scholar and activist Ward Churchill on all accounts. CU
Boulder administration, right wing pundits and much of the mainstream
press is fuming as a result.
You'll find many articles regretably conceding that yes indeed the
firing of Ward Churchill was fueled not by academic misconduct, but by
his controversial essay On the Justice of Roosting Chickens. The jury
agreed to all three points of the prosecution: that CU used Churchill's
opinions and words to terminate him, that the termination harmed
Churchill, and that had it not been for the essay he had written (as
opposed to the allegations of academic misconduct) that Churchill would
still be teaching at the University of Colorado.
Still, quickly looking at the headlines from major news outlets and the
story continues to be smearing Churchill, rather than recognizing that a
university joined forces with conservative politicians to lead a
witchhunt against a teacher for their political beliefs.
In the Denver Post, the lead article is &quot;$1 for Churchill,&quot; focusing not
so much on the ruling itself, but on the lone dollar being awarded to
Churchill. This misses the entire point of the court case, which was to
seek justice and not monetary compensation. Andrew Cohen of CBS News
offers an &quot;analysis&quot; which furthers the tired argument from the right
claiming that yet again another lazy, incompetent professor is saved by
tenure and the opaque technicalities of law. This analysis makes claim
after claim of Churchill being a poor professor who has not contributed
to the academic world. This despite Churchill boasting of a huge resume
of writings and analysis repeatedly referenced in Ethnic Studies. It
fails to mention that before his firing he was teaching to standing room
only classes or received an award for his scholarly contributions the
same year he was fired.
The story of the day should be about the victory of free speech over the
attempts by CU administrators and politicians of firing someone based on
their constitutionally-protected political beliefs. Luckily that was the
result of the trial, whether the media wants to recognize it or not.
In case you haven't heard yet, Ward Churchill, and justice, prevailed in
a Denver courtroom this afternoon. The jury in the 31/2 week trial was
asked to decide three questions (which I'm paraphrasing): 1)Did CU
Regents use protected speech (Ward's 9/11 essay) as a substantial or
motivating factor in its decision to terminate Ward? The jury answered Yes.
2)Did the termination harm Ward? The jury answered Yes.
3)Have the defendants shown that Ward would have been dismissed for
other reasons? The jury answered No. In some ways this was the most
important question. By answering No, the jury said not only that Ward's
First Amendment protected speech led to his firing, but that the
&quot;finding&quot; of the CU committee that Ward engaged in academic misconduct
was bogus, and there was no justification for firing him. As Ward said
to the press shortly after the verdict, and as was obvious all along,
this was a political motivated firing, and the jury in their verdict
said as much.
The jury awarded one dollar. But as David Lane, Ward's primary attorney,
had said all along, this was never about money, it was about justice and
vindication for Ward, and that's what the jury gave him.
Whether Ward will get reinstated is now apparently up to Judge Naves.
Attorneys have 30 days to prepare motions and then he'll make a decision.

A group of students held a protest rally against the Iranian government
and president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the University of Tehran on Sunday
to commemorate Student Day, the anniversary of the murdering of three
students of University of Tehran on December 6, 1953.
Daftare Tahkim Vahdat (means the Office of Consolidation of Unity), an
important student association, had organised this demonstration to
protest against censorship, gender apartheid and pressure on students.
They chanted slogans such as &#8220;Down with the dictatorship&#8221; and clashed
with security forces. You can see a collection of photos here.
Here is a video on the demonstration:
Salam Demokrat says that students who had been in jail or deprived of
studying delivered speeches at the university. The blogger adds:

Mahdieh Golro talked about the women's movement and her experience in

students read their statement and socialist students distributed their
tracks.
The blogger adds that the number of students was between 3000 to 4000.

Group causes damage at Tehran University: report

Quake hits island off south Iran, five hurt--media
07 Dec 2008
TEHRAN (Reuters) - An &quot;illegal splinter group&quot; of an Iranian student
body caused damage and clashed with security personnel during a
gathering at Iran's largest university on Sunday, the official IRNA news
agency reported.
Pictures obtained by Reuters showed hundreds of people gathered at
Tehran University in the center of the Iranian capital, some of them
carrying pro-democracy banners.
One photograph showed some demonstrators tearing down a metal gate at
the university, one of the oldest campuses in Iran. IRNA called those
who gathered a &quot;limited group&quot; and said they had attacked the
university's western entrance gate.
Student protests have been relatively rare in recent years in Iran,
which is embroiled in a nuclear row with the United States and is often
criticized by Western rights groups for cracking down on dissent at home.
Liberal-minded students and academics have criticized President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad for clamping down on dissent on campuses. The president and
his government say they support free speech and welcome constructive
opposition. Ahmadinejad is expected to seek another four-year term in an
election next June.
&quot;We want democracy,&quot; said a placard carried by one protester on one of
the photographs made available to Reuters. &quot;Return expelled students and
professors,&quot; said another.
IRNA said people gathering at the campus &quot;must have confused Tehran
University with a battlefield&quot; and denounced their &quot;savage moves and
insulting slogans.&quot;
Referring to a prominent Iranian student movement, the state news agency
said &quot;an illegal splinter group associated to the Office of
Consolidation of Unity tried to express their existence by inflicting
damage to the university's property.&quot;
It did not give details about the damage at the university.
Students and activists say some of those who have spoken out against the
conservative government have been detained or blacklisted from
university courses.
Rights activists say other dissenting voices, including labor movement
figures and women's rights campaigners, have also been targets of a
government crackdown.

Talks Fail to End Tree-Sitting Protest at University of California Santa
Cruz
Friday, December 12, 2008 | FoxNews.com

SANTA CRUZ, Calif. &#8212; Mediation talks have failed to end the nearly
14-month anti-development protest in redwood trees at University of
California, Santa Cruz.
Representatives of the Science Hill tree-sitters and the university
chancellor's office ended Wednesday night without resolution.
Protest spokeswoman Jennifer Charles says the university refused to back
off north campus development. The redwoods must be cut down so
construction can begin this spring on the new university biomedical
facility.
University spokesman Jim Burns says it's hoped tree-sitters will leave
voluntarily. A judge ordered them out of the trees in March and the
mediation sessions were designed to end the protest peacefully.

Students to hold demos to protest against Bill

By SIMON SIELEPosted Saturday, December 13 2008 at 22:12
University and middle-level colleges on Saturday said they would
organise a series of peaceful demonstrations to protest against what
they called an attempt to muzzle the media.
They said they would also protest against rising food prices and MPs&#8217;
failure to pay taxes. &#8220;This action is the only option left to instil a
sense of responsibility in the Government,&#8221; they said.
The group calling itself Student Leaders Forum took issue with the MPs&#8217;
decision to vote in favour of the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Bill
which they said is aimed at gagging the Press.
&#8220;We believe the Bill, if passed into law in its current form, will
interfere with the democracy Kenya is enjoying, including freedom of the
Press, which has done us proud by exposing the shoddy deals and scandals
that we might not have known were it not for the media,&#8221; said their
spokesman, Mr Mohammed Yosuf.
He added that arrangements had been made for young people across the
country to converge on Nairobi on Monday to bring pressure to bear on
the President not to assent to the Bill.
The students termed the proposed law &#8220;draconian in its current form
unless it is returned to Parliament for the necessary amendment.&#8221;
They vowed not to pay taxes in future unless MPs do so in order
allocations to the Higher Education Loans Board may go up.

Universities, union clash over smoking ban
Jump to full article: AP, 2008-12-24
Author: MARTHA RAFFAELE, AP Education Writer

Intro:
Grabbing a quick smoke between classes has become impossible for Lock
Haven University political science professor Robert Storch.
An indoor and outdoor smoking ban imposed at Pennsylvania's state
university system in September means Storch must walk off campus
whenever he craves nicotine - a 20-minute roundtrip excursion that he
cannot cram into a 15-minute break between classes.
``I find it ridiculous,'' Storch told a Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board hearing examiner Tuesday. ``You feel like a leper anyway. It's
really very demeaning.''
Storch was among a handful of professors at the 14 universities who
testified about the smoking ban during a hearing on an unfair labor
practice complaint filed by the State System of Higher Education's
faculty union. A ruling is not expected before February.
The 5,900-member Association of Pennsylvania State College and
University Faculties wants the ban rescinded. The new policy was imposed
with virtually no warning, and APSCUF argues that any changes should
have been negotiated with the union first.

Nebraska Faculty, Students to Protest Canceling of Bill Ayers Lecture

The controversy over Bill Ayers continues this week in America's
heartland. On Friday, November 14, a teach-in protest is taking place on
the Lincoln campus at the University of Nebraska. Flyers are billing the
event as a chance to &quot;make Nebraska history&quot; as

Nebraska Faculty, Students to Protest Canceling of Bill Ayers Lecture
Date: November 14, 2008
Lincoln, NE
United States of America
students and faculty come &quot;to protest UNL's decision to cancel the
November 15 lecture by Prof. William Ayers and that decision's violation
of academic freedom.&quot;

Ayers was originally invited to give a lecture as part of an education
conference this weekend. When news of his scheduled appearance came into
the spotlight, an outcry from some Nebraskans and university donors
prompted the university to retract the invitation for Professor Ayers to
speak. A number of faculty and students intend to show they protest that
decision on Friday afternoon.

Participants are being invited to join &quot;open discussions on academic
freedom&quot; and hear individuals present about &quot;the history of defending
civil rights in Nebraska.&quot; At least one group of faculty and students is
planning to meet before the protest and walk together to the event as a
display of solidarity.

Although this weekend's conference is being run by the College of
Education, the English Graduate Student Association is sponsoring
Friday's teach-in. Faculty from several departments, including English
and education plan to present their perspectives on the issues at stake.
Following a video covering the history of teach-ins, speakers will
address topics that include on academic freedom and its history at UNL.
To conclude the event, a faculty member will read &quot;What I Might Have
Said&quot; and &quot;The Right to Think at All&quot; by William Ayers.

Demonstration at Delhi University
NEW DELHI: The Democratic Teachers&#8217; Forum for Social Justice held a
demonstration at Delhi University on Tuesday demanding &#8220;social justice
for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes at all
levels&#8221;.
The Forum has demanded immediate implementation of the University Grants
Commission&#8217;s guidelines (May 2006) regarding reservation in teaching
positions for SC/ST candidates. It has also said that the ad hoc
positions for teaching posts reserved for SCs/STs/OBCs must be filled by
reserved candidates only, said Forum coordinator Ratan Lal.

Protesters Argue Against CSU Cuts
Posted By: Jennifer Smith 4 months ago
SACRAMENTO, CA - They call it a &quot;Board of Consequences.&quot;
CSU Sacramento faculty, students and staff rallied Wednesday to protest
proposed cuts of $66.3 million to the CSU budget and caps on enrollment,
and posted their concerns on a big board outside the campus library.
All 23 CSU campuses have been directed to reduce their budgets by about
7 percent, and some have already laid off or trimmed the work of
lecturers and other part-time faculty. A hiring and pay freeze may also
be considered.
Joining us Live_OnLine Wednesday was Dr. Kevin Wehr, Professor of
Sociology at Sacramento State University.
He described how CSUS students and faculty are posting personal stories
of the impact of the cuts on the &quot;Board of Consequences.&quot;
They have sent several hundred fax messages to Governor Schwarzenegger
to protest the cuts, and will continue to send them. Professor Wehr said
faculty and students are getting anxious, as the cuts continue to come.
He said it makes it difficult to prepare curriculum, and for students to
to plan their progress toward graduation, which for some may now be
delayed.
Professor Wehr said the Administration, Faculty, staff and students are
all working together to try and preserve and protect the CSU education.

Protestors who marched from West Sacramento to the capitol Monday
morning said community colleges are only being funded about two percent
more each year, while their enrollments are increasing by 10 percent.
According to students, this means that it's harder to get classes and
that it's taking longer to get through school.
&quot;We're looking ahead,&quot; said Dean Murakami, who teaches at American River
College. &quot;I think California needs to decide what's important, not only
for California now, but in our future and we are willing to make the
proper investment in education today.&quot;
Also at Monday's rally were representatives from the University of
California and California State University systems. The budget approved
in February chopped $450 million from UC and $283 million from CSU.
&quot;I need that piece of paper to get a better job, &quot; said Patricia
Hoskins. She's worried that increased fees and overcrowded classes will
force her to give up her full-time student status. &quot;I'll have to become
a part-time student and go back to work making minimum wage. I don't
want that. I want to become a teacher,&quot; she said.
Bob Price, a professor at the City College of San Francisco, said he
fears that college budget cuts will keep eventually hamper California's
ability to get back on firm financial footing.
&quot;We've already reduced the number of classes we offer,&quot; said Price. &quot;A
lot of times we see students waiting semester after semester for classes
that they need to move on to UC or CSU. It really delays their education
and sometimes they give up.&quot;
Marchers said they realize there's not much they'll be able to do about
the current budget, but they hope legislators spare them more pain if
the economy worsens.
According to the California Legislature's budget analyst, the recession
has created another $8 billion hole. The unemployment rate, further
declines in the stock market and lower tax collections have led to the
lower revenue projections.
&quot;We're going to have another $8 billion shortfall,&quot; said Axel Borg, a UC
Davis librarian. &quot;I think we're going to have to do a new budget and
hopefully legislators recognize the role higher education plays.&quot;

Other States - Puducherry

Lecturers stage protest
Staff Reporter
PUDUCHERRY: The Puducherry Government Directly Recruited Higher
Secondary Lecturers&#8217; Association staged a protest on Wednesday to demand
creation of additional posts of Vice-Principals and proper
implementation of Assured Career Progression (ACP). Secretary of the
association K. Ramu said the government had announced the creation of 48
additional Vice-Principal posts in the Assembly in 2006 to enhance the
promotion chances of lecturers. But the posts have still not been
created, leaving the lecturers with eight per cent chance of being
promoted.
&#8220;As many as 200 lecturers are working in the same cadre of lecturers for
the last 27 years. If the additional posts of Vice-Principals are
created, then the chances for promotion will increase,&#8221; he said.
The association urged the government for proper implementation of ACP
with full monetary benefits for the lecturers. &#8220;In the last three years,
14 posts of Vice-Principals in government higher secondary schools
remain vacant. We want the government to fill the posts immediately. In
addition, the government should evolve a regional transfer policy before
executing the inter-regional transfers,&#8221; he pointed out. Apart from
this, he said lecturers in rural areas should receive an additional 10
per cent as &#8220;village allowance.&#8221;

Youth to join Referendum Law protest
DEMOCRATIC DRIVE: Student organizations heeded the call of a professor
staging a hunger strike outside the legislature to demand the Referendum
Law be changed
By Shih Hsiu-Chuan
STAFF REPORTER
Friday, Oct 31, 2008, Page 3
A group of young people plan to stage a vigil tonight in support of Tsai
Ting-kuei (&#34081;&#19969;&#36020;), chairman of the Taiwan Association of University
Professors, and other localization activists who are staging a seven-day
hunger strike to back demands for amending the Referendum Law (&#20844;&#25237;&#27861;).
Fifty students representing 10 groups will join the hunger strike
outside the legislature starting tonight, said Chen Ya-lin (&#38515;&#20126;&#40607;), a
rally organizer.

Tsai said he wished to see more young people join him in response to an
appeal by some students that he should stop his strike to retain his
strength for further protests.

In a message he left on the association&#8217;s Web site on Monday, Tsai
expressed regret that no young people had joined the hunger strike.

Tsai says the law is undemocratic because it sets unreasonably high
thresholds for a referendum to be initiated and to be passed.

&#8220;Professor Tsai has said that he wished young people would join him, and
we also think that we are obliged to play a role in the fight for a
better democracy,&#8221; Chen said.

Chen said the student groups launched a drive on the Internet, asking
for 1,000 young people to participate in the hunger strike.

&#8220;We hope young people planning to join the vigil will bring flashlights
so that they can shine them on the legislature to dispel its darkness,&#8221;
Chen said.

The Taiwan Association of University Professors said in a statement on
its Web site that Tsai would end his hunger strike if young people would
take over the protest, because that would mean young people are also
concerned about issues related to the public interest and that he was
not alone in his concern.

Whether he receives support or not, Tsai would continue to push for
amending the law, the statement said.

Shimla, September 19: &quot;The Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the present
scenario would reverse what was achieved over decades through
implementation of land reforms to re-distribute over two million hectare
of land to the landless.&quot; A national conference on economic and social
perspectives of SEZs at Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS),
Shimla, opened on Thursday morning with this statement made by president
of Indian Academy of Social Sciences, Allahabad, S.P. Shukla.
By evening, the academicians got an opportunity to get a first-hand
account of threats to people facing displacement through SEZs when a
group of people who are agitating against the proposed SEZ at Gagret in
Una talked to them through the same platform.
Narender Parmar, legal advisor of Matribhumi Sangharsh Samiti of Una,
said the Government was not presenting a true picture about the number
of farmers who would be displaced by the proposed SEZ of SKIL
Infrastructure Limited.
&quot;We have sought information under the Right to Information in which it
is clearly mentioned that the SEZ and airport proposed in Una would
require 11.5 thousand acres of land, whereas the survey has only been
done of 4,000 acres,&quot; said Parmar.

Cameroon: Lecturers to Protest Poor Pay
Azore Opio
27 October 2008
Higher education and research in the country seem to be in grave danger
of losing their top-ranking man power due to poor pay and appalling
working conditions. Thus, lecturers of the six state universities are
turning up the heat on the government to raise their pay and improve
their working conditions else, they would go on strike on November 10,
this year.
It is in this light, that the National Union of Teachers of Higher
Education, known by its acronym, SYNES, has served the Minister of
Higher Education a statutory notice of intention to go on strike if
their demands are not fulfilled.
SYNES copied the rectors and vice chancellors of all the state
universities.It would appear that SYNES Buea branch held a coordinating
meeting mid last week, which, according to a very reliable source, was
heavily attended to strategise on how to carry out the strike and how to
deal with blacklegs.
The meeting, which was also attended by SYNES national executive members
from Yaounde, focused on poor remuneration and other disincentives the
Cameroonian university lecturer is subjected to.
SYNES is demanding that the lecturers be upgraded to salary scales such
as obtains in Chad, Ivory Coast and Senegal.An assistant lecturer in
Senegal, according to a source, earns about FCFA 600,000 while his/her
Cameroonian counterpart receives a paltry FCFA less than FCFA 300,000.
Lecturers this reporter spoke to said school facilities directly affect
teaching and learning and poor conditions make it more difficult for
them to deliver adequate education.Several said poor conditions such as
little office space and teaching space; inadequate research funds, yet
what little funds there are, are spent on holding meetings and paying up
suppliers; no free access to Internet facilities have led them to
consider changing schools.
Some are thinking about leaving teaching, while others have taken up odd
jobs to make ends meet.In addition, many feel that the job of a
Cameroonian lecturer requires almost daily compromising of one's meagre
income, as some of them often must choose between protecting the
fiduciary interests of the government and the educational needs of the
students in their caseloads.
A case in point is elaborated by some lecturers in the Sciences
Department who sometimes are compelled to buy chemicals and reagents
from their pockets.This, they consider, is unfair.More fundamental
issues, however, are also at stake.
Because of the enormous disincentives, which include a staggering amount
of paperwork, overwhelming caseloads, endless meetings, escalating
poverty and increasingly adversarial, uncivil and often litigious
hierarchy, the lecturers resolved that this is their last chance to
fight for their rights.
Poor working conditions are literally driving the lecturers out of
classrooms into the streets, farms, petty trading, taxi businesses,
running bars and so on, just to make ends meet.Said one of them your
reporter met arranging bottles of beer inside a refrigerator in his bar.
&quot;Imagine a lecturer with little money and no time for himself...what do
you want him to do? Perish?&quot;All too often, the most highly trained
lecturers wallow in a sea of paperwork while under-trained prot&#233;g&#233;es and
favoured courtiers of top government officials and politicians feed on
fat for doing nothing.Despite their hard work and dedication, many
lecturers work for minimum wage.

Nigeria: Principals' Clash Stalls Academic Activities At FGC Jos
 From Andrew Agbese
12 October 2008
Jos &#8212; Academic activities were last week stopped at the Federal
Government College, Jos over a clash by two persons claiming to be
princi-pals of the school.
The clash according to in-vestigations by our correspon-dent, started
last week Thurs-day when the former principal, Mallam Alfa Abdullahi,
who was transferred in a mass exercise last month returned to reclaim
his seat.
The former principal, who had initially accepted the transfer said the
transfer had been up-turned in Abuja and that he remained the principal
of the school when the new principal, Mrs. Caroline Alayande had already
assumed duties as prin-cipal.
The new principal, Mrs. Ala-yande however refused to be-lieve the Mallam
Alfa's story as he was unable to produce any written communication to
show that his earlier transfer had been quashed. Our correspondent
learnt that the power tussle between the former principal and the new
one has impacted negatively on academic activi-ties in the school as
students have not been attending clas-ses.
Attempts to speak with both the new and old principal failed as they
were said to be civil ser-vants who can only speak with the press after
clearance from the Federal Ministry of Educa-tion in Abuja.
But the chairman of the school's Parent's Teachers As-sociation, Mr.
Ayuba Pam, confirmed that Mallam Alfa had been transferred, saying
how-ever that the former principal had informed him that the transfer
had been reversed.
He said he had not seen any letter reversing the transfer, saying he
however did not see any reason to doubt Alfa when he returned from Abuja
and said the transfer had been reversed.
Students of the school who spoke to our correspondent confirmed an ugly
incident on the assembly ground of the school last Friday, when the two
principals introduced themselves to the students as heads of
administration in the school.
Many of the teachers transferred out of the school have since left and
reported at their various places of posting while those transfered to
the school have since reported to assume duties.

Thai Students warned over boycotting classes for anti-gov`t protest
Posted: 2008/09/08
From: MNN


Thailand`s Ministry of Education has fired a `warning shot across the
bows` to get the attention of students about to take leave from their
classrooms to demand the resignation of the prime minister and his gov`t.

The ministry on Sunday officially warned the activist student group now
designating itself as the 'Young PAD' to be fully aware of the
significance of their class boycott to pressure Prime Minister Samak
Sundaravej to resign.

Late Saturday students saying they represented some 80 institutions of
higher learning nationwide called on their fellow students to absent
themselves from classes and apply their energy and intellect to convince
the prime minister to change his intention regarding staying in office.

The students say the prime minister's time at the helm of the ship of
state is over now, and that its time to leave.

The Commission on Higher Education sent letters to all universities
asking that the academic authorities monitor student movements and to
them the gravity of the situation under the Emergency Decree imposed in
Bangkok, and which remains in effect.

Secretary-General Sumet Yaemnun of the Office of Commission on Higher
Education said that the office had not imposed any rule to bar students
from expressing their political opinions and that their activities were
not against university regulations.

However, he said that students should also think about their futures and
be careful not to be convinced to do anything without understanding the
real situation.

Mr. Sumet warned that if students did not attend enough classes,
according to education sector rules, they may have to waste time
repeating another term or retaking an exam. (TNA

Clash with university over beliefs strands student
Seeking resolution of master's degree work at Temple

________________________________________
Posted: August 22, 2008
12:35 am Eastern
By Kathleen Willey
&#169; 2009 WorldNetDaily
A university student who challenged his school's &quot;speech code&quot; and won a
ruling in federal court that it was vague, overbroad and stifled student
speech, including his Christian views, is continuing his battle with
Temple University because the school has &#8211; three years after he
completed it &#8211; declined to provide a grade on his master's thesis, thus
effectively denying him his degree.
The Alliance Defense Fund recently announced that the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals had affirmed the district court victory by Christian
DeJohn, who is a sergeant in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.
The ADF handled DeJohn's successful request in the courts for a
permanent injunction against Temple University's speech code, and after
a district judge sided with DeJohn, the appeals court confirmed &quot;speech
cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption&#8230;
Furthermore, the policy's use of 'hostile,' 'offensive,' and
'gender-motivated' is, on its face, sufficiently broad and subjective
that they 'could conceivably be applied to cover any speech' of a
'gender-motivated' nature 'the content of which offends someone.'&quot;
(Story continues below)
1758626690

Continued the appeals court ruling, &quot;This could include 'core' political
and religious speech, such as gender politics and sexual morality&#8230; The
policy provides no shelter for core protected speech.&quot;
DeJohn's career, however, is not advancing as he planned. He told W ND
the judge's order did not include instructions for Temple to grade his
thesis, so more than three years after he completed it under school
supervision, it still sits.
DeJohn now is serving at Fort Meade in Maryland, and told WND how the
problems developed. He said he was enrolled at Temple in Philadelphia,
but left about seven months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks
because he was deployed to Bosnia.
While he was in Bosnia, he started getting anti-war e-mails, called
&quot;teach-ins&quot; from Richard Immerman, chairman of Temple's history
department. DeJohn responded with a request that the e-mails be stopped.
Then when he returned from active duty and tried to re-enroll in Temple
as a graduate student, he was told he had been expelled because he had
not asked permission to leave the university.
DeJohn produced copies of his written request, with copies of his orders
to deploy, and officials then attributed the situation to &quot;computer
error.&quot; He eventually was allowed back into school and worked on his
master's degree in American and Military History.
However, two professors whose classes he took, Gregory Urwin's
&quot;Comparative History of Modern Warfare&quot; and Immerman's &quot;American
Diplomatic History,&quot; included diatribes against President Bush, the
military and the war, he said.
During the course of those lectures, DeJohn expressed his opinion.
He also finished his thesis, &quot;The Sherman Tank in World War II: For Want
of a Gun,&quot; in 2005 following payments for &quot;thesis guidance&quot; to the
school, but he claims because of the dispute, the school simply declined
to address his project.
However, Ray Betzner, a Temple spokesman, told WND the court simply did
not rule in DeJohn's favor on the issues regarding the thesis.
&quot;In short, his academic performance just wasn't good enough,&quot; Temple
attorney Joe H. Tucker, Jr. said. &quot;It had nothing to do with his First
Amendment rights and everything to do with Temple professor's academic
freedom to grade a student's poorly written, poorly constructed &#8230; thesis.&quot;
However, the primary reader of his thesis, Dr. Jay Lockenour, was ready
to sign off on it but when DeJohn needed a secondary reader, Urwin
refused to approve it, DeJohn said. He said Lockenour apparently
believed it would be resolved, and advised him to register to graduate
in May 2005, but it didn't happen.
Despite those circumstances, DeJohn said Temple reported to his student
loan companies that he had obtained a diploma, causing his loans in the
amount of $50,000 to default, damaging his credit.
DeJohn said he believed Temple had initiated a campaign against him,
punishing him for openly discussing his opinions while he was a student.
He even wrote to Temple's president, David Adamany, seeking his help
regarding the obstacles he was facing.
Subsequently, when asked under oath if he was aware of DeJohn's dilemma,
Adamany denied being aware of allegations about violations of academic
freedoms. DeJohn, also under oath, produced copies of their
communication. Shortly thereafter, in a front page story in the
Philadelphia Inquirer on Jan. 20, 2006, Adamany announced his
resignation. Betzner insists that he &quot;retired.&quot;
DeJohn eventually sought help from Accuracy in Academia and a
Pennsylvania state representative, and later followed the discrimination
complaint filed by the Alliance Defense Fund.
But even today, DeJohn's academic status remains in limbo because his
status of his thesis hasn't been resolved.
And the campaign apparently even has gone beyond that. DeJohn reported
when he applied for a job as historian at The Army Military History
Institute at The Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, Urwin apparently
e-mailed one of his former students who worked there, saying that he
understood that DeJohn had applied for the job. He stated that all
veterans are mentally imbalanced because they have been trained to kill
by the Army.
DeJohn said he never even was interviewed for the post, but under a
Freedom of Information Act request, he obtained documents showing that
he was rated No. 1 out of 62 candidates for that position.
