&gt;<i> This term &quot;tactical philanthropy&quot; came up in a CSMonitor article I linkd to
</I>&gt;<i> about a week ago. Here is more on that idea, which may suggest approaches
</I>&gt;<i> those interesting in improving community infrastructure in a p2p way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;What is Tactical Philanthropy?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tacticalphilanthropy.com/philosophy-and-perspectives-top/what-is-tactical-philanthropy">http://tacticalphilanthropy.com/philosophy-and-perspectives-top/what-is-tactical-philanthropy</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8220;Tactical philanthropy&#8221; is a phrase coined by our founder Sean
</I>&gt;<i> Stannard-Stockton in 2006 in the book Mapping the New World of American
</I>&gt;<i> Philanthropy.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8220;Tactical philanthropy is an approach to philanthropy that positions
</I>&gt;<i> donors as suppliers of support to agents of social impact. Support generally
</I>&gt;<i> refers to provision of capital through grants and social investments, but
</I>&gt;<i> also includes nonfinancial support. A tactical philanthropist expresses his
</I>&gt;<i> or her interests through supporting a portfolio of organizations that are
</I>&gt;<i> effectively producing social impact in areas about which the donor is
</I>&gt;<i> passionate.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>  Tactical philanthropists are people who view their giving as a way to
</I>&gt;<i> invest in organizations that are making a positive difference in the world.
</I>&gt;<i>  Philanthropy is not always practiced this way. Strategic philanthropy is
</I>&gt;<i> an approach that positions donors as problem-solvers. While we all want to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out solutions to the world&#8217;s problems, at Tactical Philanthropy
</I>&gt;<i> Advisors we focus on helping our clients find and support great
</I>&gt;<i> organizations that are good problem solvers. We believe it is often the
</I>&gt;<i> nonprofit management teams &#8211; those with decades of experience in their
</I>&gt;<i> chosen fields &#8211; that are best positioned to figure out what works.
</I>&gt;<i>  If you are looking for a consultant who can help you figure out the best
</I>&gt;<i> way to keep kids in school, for example, we&#8217;re not the right advisor for
</I>&gt;<i> you. But if you care about keeping kids in school and want to support a
</I>&gt;<i> portfolio of outstanding nonprofit organizations that are deploying various
</I>&gt;<i> programs to keep kids in school, we&#8217;re a great fit.
</I>&gt;<i>  We believe philanthropists have many tools at their disposal, aside from
</I>&gt;<i> grantmaking: advocacy, funding media projects, and convening important
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders are all examples of important roles philanthropists can play.
</I>&gt;<i> We can help you deploy these various tactics, but we do not claim expertise
</I>&gt;<i> as social science researchers.
</I>&gt;<i>  Just as great for-profit investing is mostly about designing a solid
</I>&gt;<i> financial plan and then building a portfolio that reflects ones goals,
</I>&gt;<i> Tactical Philanthropy is about designing a great philanthropic plan and then
</I>&gt;<i> building a portfolio of grantees that is aligned with your values. If you
</I>&gt;<i> are looking for social science research consultants, we are not the firm for
</I>&gt;<i> you. If you are looking for an advisor who can help you build a personalized
</I>&gt;<i> approach to your giving and bring innovation, effectiveness and joy to your
</I>&gt;<i> philanthropy, we&#8217;d love to help you.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A related item linked from Sean Stannard-Stockton's twitter page:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Why Seth Godin Is Wrong (Updated)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://causewired.com/2009/09/15/why-seth-godin-is-wrong/">http://causewired.com/2009/09/15/why-seth-godin-is-wrong/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Online marketing guru Seth Godin takes aim at nonprofits in a widely-quoted
</I>&gt;<i> blog post &#8220;The problem with non&#8221; today, a diatribe of sorts that repeats a
</I>&gt;<i> meme that&#8217;s been active in American philanthropy circles for at least a
</I>&gt;<i> decade: nonprofits are afraid of change. ... Undoubtedly, control and
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucracy can be big problems with nonprofits, large and small. But does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone now living believe that the most philanthropic nation in the history
</I>&gt;<i> of the world should devolve its nonprofit and service sector into a
</I>&gt;<i> crowd-sourced cyberlibertarian throw of the dice at utopia? Yes, $300
</I>&gt;<i> billion annually is less than 2% of GDP &#8211; but it&#8217;s a vital 2% for those who
</I>&gt;<i> rely on the services and support that nonprofits provide. I don&#8217;t &#8211; and I
</I>&gt;<i> preach digital change to nonprofits every day. Change ain&#8217;t easy when the
</I>&gt;<i> world keeps moving and you have the keep the lights on &#8211; ask the President.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, lots of issues there raised from different perspectives about the
</I>&gt;<i> way non-profits and new media are interacting. Of course, some here might
</I>&gt;<i> like a &quot;crowd-sourced cyberlibertarian throw of the dice at utopia&quot; funded
</I>&gt;<i> to the tune of US$300 billion a year. :-) And I'm all for turning over the
</I>&gt;<i> money for compulsory schooling directly to parents to help promote aspects
</I>&gt;<i> of that. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/towards-a-post-scarcity-new-york-state-of-mind.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/towards-a-post-scarcity-new-york-state-of-mind.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, in any case, interesting things to think about whatever parts one
</I>&gt;<i> agrees with. In general, this shows how a conversation is going on right now
</I>&gt;<i> about p2p-related issues in the non-profit realm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, also from the CSMonitor, from this week:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://features.csmonitor.com/economyrebuild/2009/09/15/economic-scene-afghanistan-will-cost-us-more-than-iraq/">http://features.csmonitor.com/economyrebuild/2009/09/15/economic-scene-afghanistan-will-cost-us-more-than-iraq/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> For the first time, the war in Afghanistan in the next budget year will
</I>&gt;<i> cost Americans more than the war in Iraq. By the end of the next fiscal
</I>&gt;<i> year, which starts Oct. 1, the total military budget costs for both wars
</I>&gt;<i> will have exceeded $1 trillion. That&#8217;s more than the cost of the Vietnam
</I>&gt;<i> War, adjusting for inflation, or any other US war except World War II ($3.2
</I>&gt;<i> trillion in 2007 dollars). A trillion dollars is hard to imagine. Think of
</I>&gt;<i> it this way: If you had an expense account good for $1 million a day, it
</I>&gt;<i> would take 2,935 years to spend $1.071 trillion, which is the actual
</I>&gt;<i> estimate for the wars&#8217; price tag by Travis Sharp of the Center for Arms
</I>&gt;<i> Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington. He reckons the two conflicts
</I>&gt;<i> will have cost the typical American family of four roughly $13,000 by next
</I>&gt;<i> year. ... Costs and utilization of healthcare and other veterans&#8217; benefits
</I>&gt;<i> are running about 30 percent higher than she and coauthor Joseph Stiglitz, a
</I>&gt;<i> Columbia University Nobel Prize economist, estimated in their 2008 New York
</I>&gt;<i> Times bestseller, &#8220;The Three Trillion Dollar War.&#8221; Adding in some social
</I>&gt;<i> costs (such as families caring for the disabled and a diminished labor
</I>&gt;<i> force), the two economists put a &#8220;moderate-realistic&#8221; price tag on the two
</I>&gt;<i> wars of $5 trillion.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine for one moment that after 9/11/200 (or 9/11/1973) the USA had been
</I>&gt;<i> able to look itself in the mirror, and had decided to spend US$5 trillion of
</I>&gt;<i> the money to be incurred on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in a different
</I>&gt;<i> way, to promote mutual security and prosperity globally. (And some people at
</I>&gt;<i> the time did say the war costs would be in that neighborhood, not a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cakewalk&quot;.) So, imagine the USA picked, say, our Michel Bauwens to spend
</I>&gt;<i> the money globally for building a new sustainable society with a central
</I>&gt;<i> theme of p2p. :-) And imagine President Bush had told Michel to spend that
</I>&gt;<i> money all in thirty years. I'd suggest Michel (or anyone) would have been
</I>&gt;<i> hard pressed by the relentless pace of needing to come up with a place to
</I>&gt;<i> spend US$500 million dollars each and every day on p2p for thirty years. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure he would try though. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And every day on this list, for thirty years, we could nag him, day in, day
</I>&gt;<i> out, &quot;Michel, have you spent that US$500 million today? No? Get back to
</I>&gt;<i> work!&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest Michel, like anybody, might collapse under the strain. :-( He
</I>&gt;<i> might then decide, every day, for thirty years, to just pick a thousand
</I>&gt;<i> names out of a telephone book, give them each half a million US dollars and
</I>&gt;<i> a printed flier on p2p, and hope for the best. :-) In one year, that would
</I>&gt;<i> be 365,000 people that Michel had given MacArthur Foundation level P2P
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Genius Awards&quot; to -- just random people off the street even. Just out of
</I>&gt;<i> hope a few might do good things. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's even been outlined on TV in the 1950s:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Millionaire is a television drama anthology series that aired on CBS
</I>&gt;<i> from January 19, 1955 to June 8, 1960, originally sponsored by
</I>&gt;<i> Colgate-Palmolive.. The series explored the ways unexpected wealth changed
</I>&gt;<i> life for better or for worse. The show became a five-season hit, thanks in
</I>&gt;<i> large part to a twist that also made it a bit of a cult classic in the years
</I>&gt;<i> that followed its life in the so-called &quot;Golden Era&quot; of U.S. television. The
</I>&gt;<i> show centered around the stories of unknown people who were given, seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> out of nowhere, one million dollars from a benefactor who insisted they
</I>&gt;<i> never know him &#8211; with one memorable exception.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, for all that money spent differently, there would be more that four
</I>&gt;<i> thousand US families who would still have their loved one alive, and more
</I>&gt;<i> than 30,000 US families that would still have their loved one physically
</I>&gt;<i> whole, and more than probably 300,000 US families that would still have
</I>&gt;<i> their loved one mentally whole, and maybe millions of Iraqi families that
</I>&gt;<i> would still have their loved ones and still be living in their homes.
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_casualties.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_casualties.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest, overall, we'd even all be much better off, even if Michel just
</I>&gt;<i> burned the money every day, out of desperation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, we can try to imagine it, and it is not that unrealistic, because,
</I>&gt;<i> the USA also just spent trillions on a bailout, and no doubt it could afford
</I>&gt;<i> to spend trillions for self-renewal, even now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And foundations have tens of trillions of US dollars coming in over the
</I>&gt;<i> next few decades to spend on good works. A flow into foundations of US$55
</I>&gt;<i> trillion is expected over the next 25 years according to this:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Is Open Source the Answer To Giving?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/20/1313223">http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/20/1313223</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All they have to do is start sending Michel checks for US$500 million every
</I>&gt;<i> day. :-) I'm sure he'd be willing to try to to keep up with the torrent for
</I>&gt;<i> a while. :-) Kind of like playing &quot;SimCity&quot; with the &quot;cheat&quot; amount of
</I>&gt;<i> money. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, if Michel decided to take a year-and-a-half sabbatical, he could fund
</I>&gt;<i> this with the money he'd otherwise have to spend during that time:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;A Solar Grand Plan&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-solar-grand-plan">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-solar-grand-plan</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A massive switch from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power plants to
</I>&gt;<i> solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.&#8217;s electricity and 35
</I>&gt;<i> percent of its total energy by 2050. ... But $420 billion in subsidies from
</I>&gt;<i> 2011 to 2050 would be required to fund the infrastructure and make it
</I>&gt;<i> cost-competitive. ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, if there is one good thing to come out of the wars the US launched
</I>&gt;<i> in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is to show that all our global problems stem
</I>&gt;<i> more from ideology and a lack of imagination, than from a lack of resources
</I>&gt;<i> (financial or otherwise).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, humorously, this is a simulation of the leadership we need: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;President George W. Bush singing John Lennon's Imagine&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOEhQXUS_ws&amp;NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOEhQXUS_ws&amp;NR=1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original version:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;John Lennon - Imagine&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GAHFrLAxzM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GAHFrLAxzM</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, anyway, we might hope to see more &quot;tactical philanthropy&quot; in a p2p
</I>&gt;<i> direction in the future. :-) It's not that hard to imagine. :-)
