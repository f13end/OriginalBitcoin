<PRE>Franz and Michel:

I read what seems a prelude to a manifesto (and I don't mean that as a bad
thing) with interest.  I agree with much of it.  However, I am conflicted by
too whole-heartedly abandoning abundance theory discussions since so many
seem to hold it as a primary view.  Fragmenting those people into another
stream or movement would not prove productive.  I personally do not hold the
anti-capitalist views of 98% of the community.  Stan might be another with
somewhat similar views to mine on that score...we differ on others.
Abundance discussions will, for a long time, be prominent.  I'd personally
advocate welcoming them, and note your desire to work through contentions to
common grounds.

Otherwise in tone, I strongly agree with what you have here. I personally
doubt there are magical technical fixes looming, but I am from that
worldview as well in some ways.  If technology can help save us, we should
be open to it (not that you are saying otherwise.)

&gt;<i> We know we don&#180;t speak for everybody, since we are a pluralistic community
</I>&gt;<i> and we seek commonalities  between divergent views, but that does not mean
</I>&gt;<i> that we don&#8217;t have a concern about the efficiency of what we are doing. In
</I>&gt;<i> this context, we feel the need to distinguish the P2P theory view from
</I>&gt;<i> post scarcity assumptions that have received such a prominent place on the
</I>&gt;<i> P2P research mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> To make a strong statement: P2P (and also GlobalVillages) is not about
</I>&gt;<i> post &#8211; scarcity, but about restoring the right balance between scarcity
</I>&gt;<i> and abundance &#8211; which is an alltogether different thing.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not believe that technology by itself provides any complete social
</I>&gt;<i> solution, but it is always embedded in and driven by particular social and
</I>&gt;<i> political logics
</I>&gt;<i> For example, automation is very much driven by capitalist competition to
</I>&gt;<i> be more productive than other market players. It is absolutely not sure
</I>&gt;<i> that autonomous communities would choose to totally abolish manual work.
</I>&gt;<i> It is totally legitimate that communities or countries would choose
</I>&gt;<i> industrious development paths preserving and augmenting direct human
</I>&gt;<i> involvement in material production.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, an agricultural community may want to preserve its
</I>&gt;<i> traditional ways of life &#8211; and that is a freedom we want everybody to have.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we can say that our contacts with local activist communities have
</I>&gt;<i> made us aware that the identification with post-scarcity thinking is
</I>&gt;<i> politically problematic &#8211; in particular the image of the &#8222;magical
</I>&gt;<i> technical fix&#8220;.
</I>&gt;<i> We do not want to stop the dialogue, but we would like to make clear that
</I>&gt;<i> no consensus can be assumed on that - and as a movement we do not want to
</I>&gt;<i> be identified with it. It is not a central message, it is merely the hope
</I>&gt;<i> of some, of people that we do respect but also who carry a much stronger
</I>&gt;<i> burden of proof. People who make extraordinary claims are bound more than
</I>&gt;<i> others to show practical implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> All the material we have in the P2P wiki are actually existing projects
</I>&gt;<i> and it is out of the observation of these existing social practises that
</I>&gt;<i> we draw our conclusions.
</I>&gt;<i> STRATEGY
</I>&gt;<i> P2P is operating in a world which is characterised by 2 main factors,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly wrongly perceived:
</I>&gt;<i> - Scarcity of natural resources, which is increasingly accelerated by a
</I>&gt;<i> dysfunctional mode of production and is putting us into ever more serious
</I>&gt;<i> planetary management problems. We are in friendly terms with the
</I>&gt;<i> environmental movement(s) that adresses these issues and becomes more
</I>&gt;<i> practical every day (renewables, solar, distributed energy...)
</I>&gt;<i> - Our own priority as P2P movement is adressing the second factor, which
</I>&gt;<i> is the enclosure of the intellectual and scientific and cultural commons
</I>&gt;<i> which is being addressed by the &#8222;Open Everything Movements&#8220;.  Opening up
</I>&gt;<i> the realm of ideas and allowing the massive collaboration of the general
</I>&gt;<i> intellect of the world is an essential condition of mastering the
</I>&gt;<i> ecological crisis and to the fulfillment of the better promises and
</I>&gt;<i> achievements of our civilisation through the building of a new
</I>&gt;<i> civilisation or rather new culture.
</I>&gt;<i> But there is a third necessary factor that is crucial for a thrivable
</I>&gt;<i> solution which would allow for further human evolution:  without true
</I>&gt;<i> active participation of all in the design and production of our material
</I>&gt;<i> life, without the involvement of the majority of human beings into the
</I>&gt;<i> effort to find a new social contract, we will not be able to reach the
</I>&gt;<i> goals of a better life on this planet. Therefore P2P has to join forces
</I>&gt;<i> with the third mass movement on this planet, which could roughly be
</I>&gt;<i> characterized as the social justice movement, involving the struggles of
</I>&gt;<i> workers, farmers, entrepreneurs and knowledge workers.
</I>&gt;<i> We currenly see a strategic convergence of these three movements and we
</I>&gt;<i> think it is our own responsibility to help make it happen. We believe that
</I>&gt;<i> a perceived identification between P2P and post scarcity is counter to
</I>&gt;<i> that goal, because post-scarcity is intentionally ignoring important
</I>&gt;<i> issues raised by the other two movements, i.e. the ecological and social
</I>&gt;<i> justice movement.
