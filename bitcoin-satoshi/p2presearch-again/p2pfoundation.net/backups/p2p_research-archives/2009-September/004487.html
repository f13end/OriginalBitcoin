Remarkable argument.  The gods of economics hurling the biggest thunderbolts
academics can throw.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?em=&amp;pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?em=&amp;pagewanted=all</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Few economists saw our current crisis coming, but this predictive failure
</I>&gt;<i> was the least of the field&#8217;s problems. More important was the profession&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market
</I>&gt;<i> economy. During the golden years, financial economists came to believe that
</I>&gt;<i> markets were inherently stable &#8212; indeed, that stocks and other assets were
</I>&gt;<i> always priced just right. There was nothing in the prevailing models
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting the possibility of the kind of collapse that happened last year.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, macroeconomists were divided in their views. But the main
</I>&gt;<i> division was between those who insisted that free-market economies never go
</I>&gt;<i> astray and those who believed that economies may stray now and then but
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> any major deviations from the path of prosperity could and would be
</I>&gt;<i> corrected by the all-powerful Fed. Neither side was prepared to cope with
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> economy that went off the rails despite the Fed&#8217;s best efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>  And in the wake of the crisis, the fault lines in the economics
</I>&gt;<i> profession have yawned wider than ever. Lucas says the Obama
</I>&gt;<i> administration&#8217;s stimulus plans are &#8220;schlock economics,&#8221; and his Chicago
</I>&gt;<i> colleague John Cochrane says they&#8217;re based on discredited &#8220;fairy tales.&#8221; In
</I>&gt;<i> response, Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley, writes of
</I>&gt;<i> the &#8220;intellectual collapse&#8221; of the Chicago School, and I myself have
</I>&gt;<i> written
</I>&gt;<i> that comments from Chicago economists are the product of a Dark Age of
</I>&gt;<i> macroeconomics in which hard-won knowledge has been forgotten.
</I>&gt;<i>  What happened to the economics profession? And where does it go from here?
</I>&gt;<i>  As I see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as
</I>&gt;<i> a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.
</I>&gt;<i> Until the Great Depression, most economists clung to a vision of capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> as a perfect or nearly perfect system. That vision wasn&#8217;t sustainable in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> face of mass unemployment, but as memories of the Depression faded,
</I>&gt;<i> economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> which rational individuals interact in perfect markets, this time gussied
</I>&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;<i> with fancy equations. The renewed romance with the idealized market was, to
</I>&gt;<i> be sure, partly a response to shifting political winds, partly a response
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> financial incentives. But while sabbaticals at the Hoover Institution and
</I>&gt;<i> job opportunities on Wall Street are nothing to sneeze at, the central
</I>&gt;<i> cause
</I>&gt;<i> of the profession&#8217;s failure was the desire for an all-encompassing,
</I>&gt;<i> intellectually elegant approach that also gave economists a chance to show
</I>&gt;<i> off their mathematical prowess.
</I>&gt;<i>  Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led
</I>&gt;<i> most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a
</I>&gt;<i> blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to
</I>&gt;<i> bubbles
</I>&gt;<i> and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the
</I>&gt;<i> imperfections of markets &#8212; especially financial markets &#8212; that can cause
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> economy&#8217;s operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to
</I>&gt;<i> the dangers created when regulators don&#8217;t believe in regulation.
</I>&gt;<i>  It&#8217;s much harder to say where the economics profession goes from here.
</I>&gt;<i> But what&#8217;s almost certain is that economists will have to learn to live
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> messiness. That is, they will have to acknowledge the importance of
</I>&gt;<i> irrational and often unpredictable behavior, face up to the often
</I>&gt;<i> idiosyncratic imperfections of markets and accept that an elegant economic
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; is a long way off. In practical terms, this will
</I>&gt;<i> translate into more cautious policy advice &#8212; and a reduced willingness to
</I>&gt;<i> dismantle economic safeguards in the faith that markets will solve all
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example &quot;free market&quot; problems, just to put them in one place from stuff
</I>&gt;<i> I've said before:
</I>&gt;<i> * negative externalities like pollution or defense costs are not priced in
</I>&gt;<i> to products like oil (profits are privatized while costs are socialized).
</I>&gt;<i> * positive externalities like the value of healthy happy people living in
</I>&gt;<i> good communities is not subsidized in products like health care;
</I>&gt;<i> * systemic risk like nuclear war or economic collapse are not controlled
</I>&gt;<i> for;
</I>&gt;<i> * free things are not sufficiently valued or subsidized, and those
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to a free commons are not supported and may even be actively
</I>&gt;<i> thwarted (like by extended copyrights or software patents or other chilling
</I>&gt;<i> effects);
</I>&gt;<i> * social institutions like compulsory schooling to prepare people for jobs
</I>&gt;<i> are designed to benefit employers, not the citizens (John Taylor Gatto);
</I>&gt;<i> * money tends to concentrate in fewer hands in a free market, which leads
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> social and economic dysfunctions (even to the point of people starving
</I>&gt;<i> amidst plenty or no one having money to start new small businesses -- since
</I>&gt;<i> it generally takes money to make money, and money provides access to better
</I>&gt;<i> information and personal health and education and social networking);
</I>&gt;<i> * there is an incentive to corporatize various commons (land, ideas, water)
</I>&gt;<i> for profit-making, removing people's ability to take care of themselves;
</I>&gt;<i> * since war production is a profitable racket (Butler), there are
</I>&gt;<i> incentives
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage build ups to global wars;
</I>&gt;<i> * those with the most economic power will tend to set standards (like
</I>&gt;<i> computer software or hardware interfaces) to benefit themselves, not the
</I>&gt;<i> general populace, and even when they do this in a neutral way, they often
</I>&gt;<i> may make bad decisions everyone else has to live with (IBM PC ISA bus
</I>&gt;<i> example missing a few pennies worth of resistors that would make it
</I>&gt;<i> self-configuring like Mac's NuBus);
</I>&gt;<i> * the promulgation of competition as a virtue even though it has
</I>&gt;<i> destructive
</I>&gt;<i> potential in all sorts of ways (Alfie Kohn);
</I>&gt;<i> * excessive focus on short-term planning and short-term profits;
</I>&gt;<i> * excessive secrecy in companies and also chilling effects of excessive
</I>&gt;<i> control of information (patents, copyrights);
</I>&gt;<i> * companies caught breaking the law get to participate in restorative
</I>&gt;<i> justice, where individuals breaking the law get punitive justice.
</I>&gt;<i> * the creation of large wealthy amoral immortal legal entities yet made of
</I>&gt;<i> human components deemed persons despite no family ties nor a grounding in
</I>&gt;<i> human community traditions, and then letting these set policy, either
</I>&gt;<i> directly or through the capture of government regulatory groups and the
</I>&gt;<i> political process by concentrated wealthy owners (plutocracy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solutions are as straightforward as they are hard to implement. They
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> relate to giving everyone a basic human right to draw from the economic
</I>&gt;<i> commons as well as be reimbursed for risk or damages the marketplace causes
</I>&gt;<i> them:
</I>&gt;<i> * a $200 per barrel-equivalent tax on fossil fuels (to make up for
</I>&gt;<i> pollution
</I>&gt;<i> and security risks, and given back to the people directly as a basic
</I>&gt;<i> income);
</I>&gt;<i> * a 94% progressive tax on income like after WWII;
</I>&gt;<i> * heavy regulation and fines for pollution;
</I>&gt;<i> * targeted social investments for positive externalities (including
</I>&gt;<i> creation
</I>&gt;<i> of more free commonses like Wikipedia by peers);
</I>&gt;<i> * ending corporate personhood and cutting back on limited liability;
</I>&gt;<i> * a wealth tax on land, patents, copyright, and so on;
</I>&gt;<i> * a basic income (including universal health care) like Nixon almost
</I>&gt;<i> passed;
</I>&gt;<i> * heavy R&amp;D investment in renewable energy and advanced manufacturing like
</I>&gt;<i> 3D printing;
</I>&gt;<i> * ensuring all charitably funded digital works are in the public domain;
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> * the end of compulsory schooling designed for an 1850s economy (see John
</I>&gt;<i> Taylor Gatto).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And probably more stuff like that.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All could be done with a few strokes of the pen in Congress, and then our
</I>&gt;<i> society might heal itself in a few years. But, it may be a long time before
</I>&gt;<i> then, because they are pretty much all against &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> lowering taxes, increasing schooling, corporatizing the results of
</I>&gt;<i> state-funded research, and forcing people to work for ration units (see the
</I>&gt;<i> Triple Revolution memorandum of 1964).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, we may just need to hit rock bottom first. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the beginning of:
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad
</I>&gt;<i> Decisions, and Hurtful Acts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0151010986">http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0151010986</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and
</I>&gt;<i> then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as
</I>&gt;<i> to show that we were right. Intellectually, is possible to carry this
</I>&gt;<i> process for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that sooner or
</I>&gt;<i> later
</I>&gt;<i> a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.
</I>&gt;<i> (George Orwell)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also from the beginning of there:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> A great nation is like a great man:
</I>&gt;<i> When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.
</I>&gt;<i> Having realized it, he admits it.
</I>&gt;<i> Having admitted it, he corrects it.
</I>&gt;<i> He considers those who point out his faults
</I>&gt;<i> as his most benevolent teachers.
</I>&gt;<i> He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That book is well worth reading to understand the *psychological* process
</I>&gt;<i> of what happened with economists and cognitive dissonance leading them to
</I>&gt;<i> systematically misunderstand reality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can economists improve? Here is a central issue I raised last year in
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> book:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html">http://www.pdfernhout.net/post-scarcity-princeton.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a sample meta-theoretical framework PU economists no doubt could
</I>&gt;<i> vastly improve on if they turned their minds to it. Consider three levels
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> nested perspectives on the same economic reality -- physical items,
</I>&gt;<i> decision
</I>&gt;<i> makers, and emergent properties of decision maker interactions. (Three
</I>&gt;<i> levels of being or consciousness is a common theme in philosophical
</I>&gt;<i> writings, usually rock, plant, and animal, or plant, animal, and human.)
</I>&gt;<i>  At a first level of perspective, the world we live in at any point in
</I>&gt;<i> time can be considered to have physical content like land or tools or
</I>&gt;<i> fusion
</I>&gt;<i> reactors like the sun, energy flows like photons from the sun or electrons
</I>&gt;<i> from lightning or in circuits, informational patterns like web page content
</I>&gt;<i> or distributed language knowledge, and active regulating processes
</I>&gt;<i> (including triggers, amplifiers, and feedback loops) built on the previous
</I>&gt;<i> three types of things (physicality, energy flow, and informational
</I>&gt;<i> patterns)
</I>&gt;<i> embodied in living creatures, bi-metallic strip thermostats, or computer
</I>&gt;<i> programs running on computer hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>  One can think of a second perspective on the first comprehensive one by
</I>&gt;<i> picking out only the decision makers like bi-metallic strips in
</I>&gt;<i> thermostats,
</I>&gt;<i> computer programs running on computers, and personalities embodied in
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe someday robots or supercomputers, and looking at their
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics as individual decision makers.
</I>&gt;<i>  One can then think of a third level of perspective on the second where
</I>&gt;<i> decision makers may invent theories about how to control each other using
</I>&gt;<i> various approaches like internet communication standards, ration unit
</I>&gt;<i> tokens
</I>&gt;<i> like fiat dollars, physical kanban tokens, narratives in emails, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> What the most useful theories are for controlling groups of decision makers
</I>&gt;<i> is an interesting question, but I will not explore it in depth. But I will
</I>&gt;<i> pointing out that complex system dynamics at this third level of
</I>&gt;<i> perspective
</I>&gt;<i> can emerge whether control involves fiat dollars, &quot;kanban&quot; tokens,
</I>&gt;<i> centralized or distributed optimization based on perceived or predicted
</I>&gt;<i> demand patterns, human-to-human discussions, something else entirely, or a
</I>&gt;<i> diverse collection of all these things. And I will also point out that one
</I>&gt;<i> should never confuse the reality of the physical system being controlled
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> the control signals (money, spoken words, kanban cards, internet packet
</I>&gt;<i> contents, etc.) being passed around in the control system.
</I>&gt;<i>  The above is somewhat inspired by &quot;cybernetics&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics</A>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'd suggest, should the PU Economics Department faculty be kept on, the
</I>&gt;<i> department should be renamed the &quot;Princeton University Cybernetics
</I>&gt;<i> Department&quot; with there being an &quot;historical economics&quot; subsection all the
</I>&gt;<i> current economics faculty are assigned to, and one faculty member each from
</I>&gt;<i> the PU Department of Religion, the PU Department of History, and the PU
</I>&gt;<i> department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering be put in as an acting
</I>&gt;<i> team triumvirate leadership of the larger department. :-) As economics
</I>&gt;<i> faculty broaden their research, then they could move into other new
</I>&gt;<i> Cybernetics department sections. See also:
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The Human Use Of Human Beings: Cybernetics And Society&quot; by Norbert
</I>&gt;<i> Wiener

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that &quot;stability&quot;, a term Paul Krugman uses in his essay, is a central
</I>&gt;<i> idea to much of cybernetics. So, as economists adopted a more cybernetic
</I>&gt;<i> world view, they would think more on an issue like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, as a video previously linked by Ryan shows, technology like advanced
</I>&gt;<i> robotics is rapidly making modern scarcity-based economic thinking
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Dexterous robot hand and arm with better-than-human hand-eye coordination&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Paul Krugman *misses* in his essay is how our social, economic,
</I>&gt;<i> educational, and political systems are completely out of sync with today's
</I>&gt;<i> technological possibilities (and needs) like from robotics, AI, 3D
</I>&gt;<i> printing,
</I>&gt;<i> and advanced biotech.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are left with these general trends amidst a likely jobless recovery:
</I>&gt;<i> * trying to make the market work with regulation, taxation, and a basic
</I>&gt;<i> income (and maybe even local currencies);
</I>&gt;<i> * people trying to get by with local subsistence (eventually aided by 3D
</I>&gt;<i> printers and solar panels);
</I>&gt;<i> * people giving to and drawing from a free commons (land, intellectual,
</I>&gt;<i> material, service) as a gift economy;
</I>&gt;<i> * more war/schooling/prisons to destroy abundance and create artificial
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity to make old market assumptions truer again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully we won't get more war/schooling/prisons, but it is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> From:

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Jobs = (Demand + War + Schooling - Abundance)) / (Automation + Design)
</I>&gt;<i> Demand is limited (the best things in life are free or cheap).
</I>&gt;<i> War and compulsory schooling are evil.
</I>&gt;<i> Automation and Design are increasing.
</I>&gt;<i> Abundance is increasing faster than decay.
</I>&gt;<i> Given that, plot the curve of jobs. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I still want to recognize and applaud Paul Krugman for making a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of progress with his own twelve-step recovery process, though I'd suggest
</I>&gt;<i> he
</I>&gt;<i> still has a bit further to go: :-)
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Confessions of a Recovering Economist*&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue21/Stanford21.htm">http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue21/Stanford21.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [My name in Paul. :-)] I am an economist.  It is seventeen days since I
</I>&gt;<i> last
</I>&gt;<i> uttered the phrase &quot;supply and demand.&quot;  But the demon still lurks untamed,
</I>&gt;<i> within me.  Economics is an addiction. Every other addiction has a Twelve
</I>&gt;<i> Step program, laced with tough love and blunt self-honesty. Why not a
</I>&gt;<i> Twelve
</I>&gt;<i> Step program for economists? God knows, we have done enough damage with our
</I>&gt;<i> arrogant, drunken prescriptions. Here's how each and every economist can
</I>&gt;<i> face up to their inner demons, and make their own small contribution to
</I>&gt;<i> setting things right.
</I>&gt;<i>  Step 1: Admit you have a problem. Like they say at the AA meetings, this
</I>&gt;<i> is half the solution. Where economists are concerned, however, it's easier
</I>&gt;<i> said than done. Getting a substance abuser to face the facts of their
</I>&gt;<i> addition is nothing compared to convincing an economist that they're hooked
</I>&gt;<i> on elegant but useless mathematical models, and authoritative but
</I>&gt;<i> destructive policy advice. Where economists are concerned, we're talking
</I>&gt;<i> denial with a capital 'D.' ...
</I>&gt;<i> Step 11: Make amends to those countries and people. Every Twelve Step
</I>&gt;<i> program requires the recovering addict to humbly commit to fix up their own
</I>&gt;<i> mess. Economists are no different. This is the time for recovering
</I>&gt;<i> economists to step to the front of the room and make personal pledges to
</I>&gt;<i> undo the damage that has been wrought in the name of supply and demand.
</I>&gt;<i> Commit to studying what's wrong with markets, as opposed to how beautifully
</I>&gt;<i> perfect they are. Work to empower rank-and-file folk, instead of dominating
</I>&gt;<i> them with your apparent but phony expertise. Start to imagine economic
</I>&gt;<i> ideas
</I>&gt;<i> that could change the world, rather than invoking economic mumbo-jumbo to
</I>&gt;<i> justify inequality and explain why it's inevitable. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Justifications for elites and social hierarchy goes all the way back to the
</I>&gt;<i> pharaohs. For 6000 years, society has organized itself into social classes.
</I>&gt;<i> The people who do the work are always in the lower classes. The harder and
</I>&gt;<i> nastier the work, the lower down in the social order you sink. The people
</I>&gt;<i> who don&#8217;t do this work must justify their position. They do it by
</I>&gt;<i> establishing their &#8220;worthiness&#8221;, and a variety of cultural devices have
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> concocted over the millennia to accomplish this. The pharaohs, you may
</I>&gt;<i> recall, weren&#8217;t people at all. They were gods. Roman emperors likewise had
</I>&gt;<i> themselves deified, and before that Roman Senators justified their position
</I>&gt;<i> as &#8220;patricians&#8221;. Basically, &#8220;my great great granddaddy was a big shot,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore I should be too.&#8221; ...
</I>&gt;<i>  Old habits die hard. In fact, we still have a &#8220;leisure class&#8221;. As
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism has grown so has the wealth and privilege of our leisure class.
</I>&gt;<i> The old mythologies &#8211; gods, the &#8220;great chain of being&#8221; etc. &#8211; are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> available to justify the existence and perpetuation of our leisure class,
</I>&gt;<i> something our elites are definitely interested in perpetuating. What was
</I>&gt;<i> needed was a new &#8220;rational&#8221; world-view that justified the existence of
</I>&gt;<i> privileged elites.
</I>&gt;<i>  That rationalization came in the form of a brand new science known as
</I>&gt;<i> economics, which included a brand new mythology.
</I>&gt;<i>  According to the new mythology, human beings are economic competitors.
</I>&gt;<i> The &#8220;marketplace&#8221; is the new &#8220;Valhalla&#8221;, where &#8220;economic man&#8221; frolics. The
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;market&#8221; we are told, contains its own &#8220;rationality&#8221;. It rewards the
</I>&gt;<i> efficient. It rewards that list of virtues George Will cites, like
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;thrift&#8221;,
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;delayed gratification&#8221; and of course, &#8220;hard work&#8221;. Free competition in the
</I>&gt;<i> market place &#8220;rationally&#8221; selects the more &#8220;worthy&#8221; competitor. Thus, the
</I>&gt;<i> wealthy are the superior competitors who have &#8220;earned&#8221; their elite status.
</I>&gt;<i> If you haven&#8217;t succeeded it can only be because of your &#8220;inferiority&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>  Before debunking this whole ideology, a few observations are in order.
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, notice that the hierarchical social order is back. It has a
</I>&gt;<i> new veneer of &#8220;rationality&#8221;, but it is the same old ugly reality. Elites
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;better&#8221; than you. The non-elites who do the work have &#8220;earned&#8221; their
</I>&gt;<i> position, and are proper objects of scorn. Thus, we have a handful of
</I>&gt;<i> haves,
</I>&gt;<i> worthy of admiration and respect, and a large class of industrial serfs who
</I>&gt;<i> own nothing but their bellies. The theory has changed, but the reality is
</I>&gt;<i> just the same. Not surprisingly, cheap-labor believers in the &#8220;rational&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy are hostile to democracy. In fact, they have decided that
</I>&gt;<i> democratic government is an enemy to &#8220;market efficiency&#8221;. What Thomas
</I>&gt;<i> Jefferson won through debunking the old forms of social hierarchy, today&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> cheap-labor conservative is busy taking back through his new &#8220;rational&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> form
</I>&gt;<i> of the same old shit. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the only way people would stand for it is with schooling:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/toc1.htm">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/toc1.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The secret of American schooling is that it doesn&#8217;t teach the way children
</I>&gt;<i> learn and it isn&#8217;t supposed to. It took seven years of reading and
</I>&gt;<i> reflection to finally figure out that mass schooling of the young by force
</I>&gt;<i> was a creation of the four great coal powers of the nineteenth century.
</I>&gt;<i> Nearly one hundred years later, on April 11, 1933, Max Mason, president of
</I>&gt;<i> the Rockefeller Foundation, announced to insiders that a comprehensive
</I>&gt;<i> national program was underway to allow, in Mason&#8217;s words, &#8220;the control of
</I>&gt;<i> human behavior.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, all these issues are intertwined -- economics, schooling, technological
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure, and so on. And finally, as George Orwell suggests, we see
</I>&gt;<i> the false beliefs of economics meeting reality on the battlefield (in this
</I>&gt;<i> case, mainly in the economy, but aspects of failure in the real battlefield
</I>&gt;<i> too in Iraq and Afghanistan). Maybe the economic beliefs were good enough
</I>&gt;<i> for post-WWII for a time when the USA dominated a lot of the world and
</I>&gt;<i> before increasing automation and better design, but the beliefs grow more
</I>&gt;<i> and more out of touch with the reality on the ground for many people in the
</I>&gt;<i> USA day by day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though with that said, there are many positive trends, anyway. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> renewable energy like wind and solar is increasing exponentially. :-) But,
</I>&gt;<i> in that sense, our physical economy is prospering despite our intellectual
</I>&gt;<i> economy (which has heavily subsidized fossil fuels and nuclear and ignored
</I>&gt;<i> external costs like defense and health issues).
