</I>&gt;<i> Money as mediation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropologists and sociologists have long rejected the impersonal model of
</I>&gt;<i> money and markets offered by mainstream economics. Viviana Zelizer, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, shows in *The Social Meaning of Money* that people refuse to
</I>&gt;<i> treat the cash in their possession as an undifferentiated thing, choosing
</I>&gt;<i> rather to &#8216;earmark&#8217; it &#8212; reserving some for food bills, some as holiday
</I>&gt;<i> savings and so on. Her examples generally come from areas that remain
</I>&gt;<i> invisible to the economists&#8217; gaze, especially domestic life. People
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere personalize money, bending it to their own purposes through a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of social instruments. This was the message too of Parry and Bloch&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> *Money and the morality of exchange*. When money and markets are
</I>&gt;<i> understood exclusively through impersonal models, awareness of this
</I>&gt;<i> neglected dimension is surely significant. But the economy exists at more
</I>&gt;<i> inclusive levels than the person, the family or local groups. This is made
</I>&gt;<i> possible by the impersonality of money and markets, where economists remain
</I>&gt;<i> largely unchallenged. Money, much as Durkheim argued for religion, is the
</I>&gt;<i> principal means for us all to bridge the gap between everyday personal
</I>&gt;<i> experience and a society whose wider reaches are impersonal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Money is often portrayed as a lifeless object separated from persons,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas it is a creation of human beings, imbued with the collective spirit
</I>&gt;<i> of the living and the dead. Money, as a token of society, must be impersonal
</I>&gt;<i> in order to connect individuals to the universe of relations to which they
</I>&gt;<i> belong. But people make everything personal, including their relations with
</I>&gt;<i> society. This two-sided relationship is universal, but its incidence is
</I>&gt;<i> highly variable. Money in capitalist societies stands for alienation,
</I>&gt;<i> detachment, impersonal society, the outside; its origins lie beyond our
</I>&gt;<i> control (the market). Relations marked by the absence of money are the model
</I>&gt;<i> of personal integration and free association, of what we take to be
</I>&gt;<i> familiar, the inside (home). This institutional dualism, forcing individuals
</I>&gt;<i> to divide themselves every day, asks too much of us. People want to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate division, to make some meaningful connection between their own
</I>&gt;<i> subjectivity and society as an object. It helps that money, as well as being
</I>&gt;<i> the means of separating public and domestic life, was always the main bridge
</I>&gt;<i> between the two. That is why money must be central to any attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> humanize society. It is both the principal source of our vulnerability in
</I>&gt;<i> society and the main practical symbol allowing each of us to make an
</I>&gt;<i> impersonal world meaningful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two great means of communication are language and money.
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropologists have paid much attention to the first, which divides us more
</I>&gt;<i> than it brings us together, but not to money whose potential for universal
</I>&gt;<i> communication is more reliable, in addition to its well-advertised ability
</I>&gt;<i> to symbolize differences between us. As a symbolic medium of communication,
</I>&gt;<i> money informs our subjectivity and gives concrete expression to our desires,
</I>&gt;<i> releasing and fixing our imagination in many ways. It is a store of
</I>&gt;<i> individual and collective memory, the stuff linking persons to their
</I>&gt;<i> communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;Just as my thoughts must take the form of a universally understood
</I>&gt;<i> language so that I can attain my practical ends in this roundabout way, so
</I>&gt;<i> must my activities and possessions take the form of money value in order to
</I>&gt;<i> serve my more remote purposes. Money is the purest form of the tool (&#8230;); it
</I>&gt;<i> is an institution through which the individual concentrates his activity and
</I>&gt;<i> possessions in order to attain goals that he could not attain directly.&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> Simmel *The Philosophy of Money*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, as Marx argued, money is a means of communication so powerful that
</I>&gt;<i> we often ascribe human or quasi-divine agency to it and what it buys. In
</I>&gt;<i> some ways, Money is the God of capitalism and most of the inmates are
</I>&gt;<i> believers. [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oswald Spengler on money and number
</I>&gt;<i> In *The Decline of the West*, Oswald Spengler emphasized the part played
</I>&gt;<i> by money and number in the history of Western European civilization and its
</I>&gt;<i> North American offshoot. The first idea I draw from him is that money is
</I>&gt;<i> just one of several abstract universals of which number, time and space may
</I>&gt;<i> be more relevant than language. The second is that, for all their apparent
</I>&gt;<i> universality, these should be approached as cultural particulars with their
</I>&gt;<i> own historical patterns of growth and decline. Third, world history in our
</I>&gt;<i> period has been dominated by the West owing to its adoption of a specific
</I>&gt;<i> form of economic life, based on money and machines, that normally goes by
</I>&gt;<i> the name of &#8216;capitalism&#8217;. Fourth, rather than adopt a timeless form of words
</I>&gt;<i> for what interests us today, we should embrace the dialectic of &#8216;becoming
</I>&gt;<i> and become&#8217;, in order to understand both the immanent direction of our
</I>&gt;<i> present circumstances (history) and their finitude as the residue of what
</I>&gt;<i> has already happened, the past (nature). So, finally, the question of
</I>&gt;<i> money&#8217;s power is historically and geographically relative: we need to attend
</I>&gt;<i> to the relationship between measurement of money as something perceptible to
</I>&gt;<i> the senses (magnitude) and money as a category of thought expressed
</I>&gt;<i> intangibly as abstract relations (function).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to Spengler, the West had exhausted the historical impulse given
</I>&gt;<i> by its modern version of economic life (featuring money and machines) and a
</I>&gt;<i> new phase, based on politics, national religion and war, was about to take
</I>&gt;<i> over. This was not a bad prediction, but Spengler&#8217;s interest for us lies in
</I>&gt;<i> how he conceived of the relationship between money and other universals.
</I>&gt;<i> Following Goethe, Spengler made a contrast between history (becoming) and
</I>&gt;<i> nature (what has become). The counterpart of longing, of the desire to move
</I>&gt;<i> forward that is becoming, is the dread of having become, of finality or
</I>&gt;<i> death; and this pair together drive cultural creativity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;Life, perpetually fulfilling itself as an element of becoming, is what we
</I>&gt;<i> call &#8216;the present&#8217;, and it possesses that mysterious property of
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;direction&#8217;, which men have tried to rationalize by means of the enigmatic
</I>&gt;<i> word &#8216;time&#8217;.&#8217;
