<PRE>Dear Richard,

I find this a fascinatig life story and it will be a pleasure to publish
this on our blog, introducing the 2 articles we already decided to publish,

I've asked chris to do this, but chris has been playing dead for me for a
while (fully legitimately of course, he must be busy), and I'm not in a
position to spent time on coding, as I didn't know what to do with the
embedded links in the format you've sent me,

If Chris can't help, then I have an alternative, i.e. to let you post the
articles directly to our blog as a writes, and it is James who gives this
access, so he is in cc,

the suggested post-dating is now, November 1 for your intro above, then 3
and 5 for your remaining articles, once in, I can add a reinforcing sentence
or 2,

I suggest starting the title heading with Poor Richard's Trilogy (1), then 2
and 3, followed by the real title

it's a honour to have your material in our context, and to have such an
interesting human being in the network,

Michel

</I>&gt;<i> Richard
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello p2p peeps,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michel asked me to introduce myself and my approach to p2p.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently started blogging this year after being &quot;out of network&quot; for a
</I>&gt;<i> long time. A couple of months ago I also opened a FaceBook
</I>&gt;<i> account--reluctantly because of the controversies. Anyway, one of my new fb
</I>&gt;<i> friends kept posting links to Michel Bauwens' articles on the P2P Foundation
</I>&gt;<i> Blog so I found my way to P2P Land--a place that feels a lot like &quot;home&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> But I have some intellectual catching up and verbal retooling to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chunks of my life have been spent not just out of network but out of
</I>&gt;<i> main$stream culture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the late 60's I became disenchanted with the civil rights movement and
</I>&gt;<i> with anti-nuclear, anti-war, and other protest movements because of what I
</I>&gt;<i> saw as an inclination of my peers to &quot;protest party&quot; more than to build new
</I>&gt;<i> realities brick by brick. I had a deep drive to &quot;be the change&quot; instead of
</I>&gt;<i> protesting the problem (not that I'm unthankful for those who do the
</I>&gt;<i> protesting).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I walked away from a stack of scholarship offers and took an old school bus
</I>&gt;<i> around the country and then into the mountains of Tennessee. Have you read
</I>&gt;<i> or seen &quot;Into the Wild &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild</A>&gt;&quot; by Jon
</I>&gt;<i> Krakauer &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer</A>&gt;? That story has many
</I>&gt;<i> parallels with my life in the seventies, except I didn't die. With the help
</I>&gt;<i> of an ingenious young junkyard owner I got the big blue bus to the top of
</I>&gt;<i> Flower Mountain, and with the help of a hillbilly family I learned how to
</I>&gt;<i> live off the grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the years I've visited many intentional communities. I've known many
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mother Earth News&quot; style back-to-the-land homesteaders. I've been exposed
</I>&gt;<i> to Appalachian hillbilly culture and had work/trade relationships with
</I>&gt;<i> members of a horse-and-buggy Mennonite community. Those were all places
</I>&gt;<i> where peer-to-peer culture was flourishing--only they didn't call it that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Around 1980 I spent a year as a Vista volunteer working with the
</I>&gt;<i> Agricultural Marketing Project to organize tailgate markets for small,
</I>&gt;<i> family farmers in church parking lots all over Appalachia. I learned about
</I>&gt;<i> the problem of farmland being converted to other uses because of development
</I>&gt;<i> pressures. I had long been interested in the legal issues confronting
</I>&gt;<i> intentional communities, community land trusts, wild habitat conservation,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. and so I went to the state of Tennessee with an idea for establishing a
</I>&gt;<i> conservation easement program to help protect farmland and &quot;open space&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> Tennessee from development. The TN Department of Conservation loved the idea
</I>&gt;<i> and the TN Conservation Easement Act of 1981&lt;<A HREF="http://www.wildlaw.org/easements/66-9-301.html">http://www.wildlaw.org/easements/66-9-301.html</A>&gt;soon came into being.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Around the same time I helped to start the Tennessee Solar Energy
</I>&gt;<i> Association &lt;<A HREF="http://tnsolarenergy.org/">http://tnsolarenergy.org/</A>&gt; with some help from Al Gore and
</I>&gt;<i> others. I used to sit in my school bus and type out the TSEA newsletter on
</I>&gt;<i> an old manual typewriter. That led to serving as a reviewer of grant
</I>&gt;<i> proposals for an appropriate technology grants program for Jimmy Carter's
</I>&gt;<i> Department of Energy. I would often review proposals by the light of a
</I>&gt;<i> kerosene lamp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My reason for mentioning that chapter of my experience is that I discovered
</I>&gt;<i> alternative ways to engage with government agencies and civil servants other
</I>&gt;<i> than via protests, petitions, and other adversarial interactions. I found
</I>&gt;<i> that overlaps in personal interests and causes could create influential
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer relationships among individuals in and out of government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But like many young men I thought I needed the constant companionship and
</I>&gt;<i> attention of a woman--and women didn't seem to like my isolated mountain
</I>&gt;<i> retreat for long. So I decided to move to town for a while and get involved
</I>&gt;<i> with more people and more causes on a daily basis. That's when an old
</I>&gt;<i> interest in computers got me involved in strange new things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My time as a Vista volunteer convinced me that non-profits were too
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on philanthropy and grant cycles. I felt that many non-profits
</I>&gt;<i> might generate some of their own revenues by offering specialized goods and
</I>&gt;<i> services that were consistent with their core mission. Habitat for
</I>&gt;<i> Humanity's popular &quot;ReStores&quot;&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_for_Humanity_International#Habitat_ReStores">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_for_Humanity_International#Habitat_ReStores</A>&gt;is a good example of the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a friend loaned me his home-built Heathkit&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit</A>&gt;personal computer I was hooked and soon I was promoting the idea of a
</I>&gt;<i> personal computer retail franchise (based on the popular ComputerLand
</I>&gt;<i> franchise but also incorporating books, classroom education, and mail order)
</I>&gt;<i> that would funnel its revenues to non-profit organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This took off almost too fast because my hopes for a worker-owned business
</I>&gt;<i> model were in conflict with the interests of the original set of &quot;angel&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> investors who participated in the start-up funding. There were many
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting agendas (none of which included personal financial gain, by the
</I>&gt;<i> way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own agenda took an almost bizzare twist as my unconscious mind ran
</I>&gt;<i> through the possibilities of what I could do with a whole inventory of
</I>&gt;<i> computers at my disposal. Direct mail marketing was a relatively new (but
</I>&gt;<i> already notorious) phenomenon in the early 80's, and I struck on the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> using the demo computers on the sales floor to do direct-mail marketing in
</I>&gt;<i> the public interest. Before long an ambitious plan took shape in my mind. I
</I>&gt;<i> would market rural Tennessee real estate to the whole country (or to the
</I>&gt;<i> entire world) using direct mail targeted at progressive, conservation-minded
</I>&gt;<i> people. A special brokerage would handle the transactions, placing
</I>&gt;<i> conservation easements and other kinds of restrictive covenenats in each
</I>&gt;<i> title, making the property attractive only to conservation-minded buyers. A
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit brokerage might afford to offer property at below-market prices,
</I>&gt;<i> and the associated easements would also confer tax benefits under the new TN
</I>&gt;<i> Conservation Easement Act. The non-profit brokerage could eventually expand
</I>&gt;<i> into green real estate development, green home building, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also imagined the possible political ramifications of attracting hoards
</I>&gt;<i> of progressive, conservation-minded people from around the US and the world
</I>&gt;<i> to sparsely-populated, rural TN counties. This could be the beginnings of an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative economic and political base in a large block of rural Tennessee
</I>&gt;<i> counties, perhaps with eventual influence on the politics and economy of the
</I>&gt;<i> whole state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it turned out I did not have the skill set or charisma  to sell
</I>&gt;<i> this idea to the investors and staff at the pace demanded by my own
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasm. I was eventually asked to resign from the organization I had
</I>&gt;<i> created over conflicts in how resources should be allocated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stung by this failure I turned to repositioning and re-branding myself.
</I>&gt;<i> Over the next decade I progressed from freelance IT consulting gigs to
</I>&gt;<i> eventually becoming one of the principle distributed computing and web
</I>&gt;<i> architects at a global Fortune 500 company. However, my attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce open-sourced software and peer-to-peer architecture into the
</I>&gt;<i> top-down corporate environment were largely unsuccessful. Deeply frustrated
</I>&gt;<i> by the vision of my &quot;peers&quot; once again, my corporate IT career came to its
</I>&gt;<i> natural conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After a pointless quest to see how much money I could earn while having no
</I>&gt;<i> time to spend it, and thoroughly burned out on high technology, I designed
</I>&gt;<i> an occupational therapy project for myself. I spent two years restoring an
</I>&gt;<i> 1890's mill-workers' house in a historic textile mill village in Burlington,
</I>&gt;<i> NC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I recycled used tools, equipment, and materials in the restoration
</I>&gt;<i> project I gained a much deeper insight into the subject of recycling and
</I>&gt;<i> repurposing of existing materials, structures, machines, etc. Although I was
</I>&gt;<i> always interested in electric vehicles, I became concerned with the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of the existing fleet of internal combustion vehicles, numbering in the
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of millions in the US alone. We could not scrap all these vehicles
</I>&gt;<i> and jump into new electric cars. Even though old vehicles can be recycled,
</I>&gt;<i> that carries an enormous energy cost before a new vehicle ever hits the
</I>&gt;<i> road.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Learning that most existing vehicles could burn high-ethanol blends, I
</I>&gt;<i> started promoting the idea of a consumer- and worker-owned ethanol
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative in the fairly progressive Durham, NC area. But the events of the
</I>&gt;<i> mortgage bubble overtook me, and faced with difficulties converting my
</I>&gt;<i> construction loan on the mill house to a conventional mortgage, I was forced
</I>&gt;<i> to sell at an unfavorable price. This was another personal setback that sent
</I>&gt;<i> me retreating to my counter-cultural roots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave away everything I owned that my friends could use and hauled the
</I>&gt;<i> remaining tools, equipment, incomplete ethanol still, etc. with me to Turtle
</I>&gt;<i> Island Preserve &lt;<A HREF="http://www.turtleislandpreserve.com/">http://www.turtleislandpreserve.com/</A>&gt;, a primitive farm
</I>&gt;<i> and educational venue in the Blue Ridge mountains owned by Eustace Conway&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustace_Conway">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustace_Conway</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> *,* an American naturalist and the subject of the book *The Last American
</I>&gt;<i> Man&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Last-American-Man-Elizabeth-Gilbert/dp/0142002836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287183449&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Last-American-Man-Elizabeth-Gilbert/dp/0142002836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287183449&amp;sr=8-1</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> *.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There, at last, I was back among kindred spirits. Eustace and his band of
</I>&gt;<i> merry men and women are some of the finest people on earth. But my stay
</I>&gt;<i> there was short. I arrived in balmy July, but by January The Blue Ridge
</I>&gt;<i> winter and the primitive lodgings proved too much for my advancing age and
</I>&gt;<i> worsening arthritis. It seems that over a decade of city life had turned me
</I>&gt;<i> into an actual city-slicker, in body if not in mind or heart. Reluctantly I
</I>&gt;<i> left with little more than the down coat on my back and headed for my
</I>&gt;<i> Mother's warm house in Alabama.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feeling that I had outlived my usefulness, I retired to a cozy, secluded
</I>&gt;<i> cottage in Alabama to feed the birds and watch the deer play. I had no use
</I>&gt;<i> for computers for a while. There was no broadband service, anyway. But
</I>&gt;<i> eventually &quot;the DSL&quot; came to my neck of the woods and the pull of Google
</I>&gt;<i> research and subversive, alternative media drew me back online. I discovered
</I>&gt;<i> the world of blogging and social networking and finally I stumbled back
</I>&gt;<i> around to the world of copyleft and p2p.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides venting opinions in Poor Richard's Almanack 2010&lt;<A HREF="http://almanac2010.wordpress.com/">http://almanac2010.wordpress.com/</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> in recent months I have been hatching a plan to save the world with a new
</I>&gt;<i> generation of video games, informed by neuroscience and experimental
</I>&gt;<i> psychology, designed to correct irrational thinking. Since I have no video
</I>&gt;<i> game, virtual reality, or neurobiolgy credentials (or any credentials other
</I>&gt;<i> than IT), this will be a highly collaborative, p2p, Creative Commons type
</I>&gt;<i> project. When I finish working on a time-sensitive proposal, I will be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to share further details. Meanwhile, I urge anyone with experience
</I>&gt;<i> implementing educational products or services in Second Life to consider
</I>&gt;<i> reading my post &quot;The Beginning of Wisdom 3.0&lt;<A HREF="http://almanac2010.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/the-beginning-of-wisdom">http://almanac2010.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/the-beginning-of-wisdom</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and contacting me by leaving a comment there or at my FaceBook page&lt;<A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/?sk=messages#%21/profile.php?id=100001304793048&amp;v=wall">http://www.facebook.com/?sk=messages#%21/profile.php?id=100001304793048&amp;v=wall</A>&gt;
