Are you saying Capitalism (or &quot;The Free Market&quot;, or whatever
'governance' is currently running) doesn't *let* scalable/distributed
&quot;city&quot; models exist?

Even if you didn't mean to say that, I think it is partially true.

The deepest failing of our current economic kernel (the way we
structure tax and trade) is the problem it has with our success.

It's funny you mention that specific game, as it was recently
relicensed (Jan-10-2008) to GNU GPLv3 and renamed Micropolis. --
<A HREF="http://donhopkins.com/home/micropolis">http://DonHopkins.com/home/micropolis</A>


Here are some other Free Software games we we might harvest ideas and code from:

<A HREF="http://cultivation.sf.net/">http://Cultivation.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;Cultivation is a game about a community of
gardeners growing food for themselves in a shared space.

<A HREF="http://wz2100.net/">http://wz2100.net</A> &gt;&gt;Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game,
developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos-Interactive(TM).
Although comparable to Earth2150(TM) in many significant respects, it
does contain aspects that are unique. These include various radar
technologies, a greater focus on artillery and counter-battery
technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as gameplay
progress, as well as a different vehicle design method. It was
released in 1999 for both PC and Playstation(R).

<A HREF="http://hectigo.net/puskutraktori/oneisenough">http://Hectigo.net/puskutraktori/oneisenough</A> &gt;&gt;Economic development in
the land of the balls has rendered communism an obsolete ideology, but
one ball is ready to stand against the cruel corporate oppressors. Is
one ball enough to free the capitalist balls from their egocentric
ideology and send them to labour camps, or is the process doomed to
fail? There's only one way to find out...

<A HREF="http://diameter.sf.net/">http://Diameter.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;&quot;Diameter&quot; is an arcade game with elements of
economy and adventure.

<A HREF="http://lists.riseup.net/www/info/ropecan">http://Lists.Riseup.net/www/info/ropecan</A> &gt;&gt;This is a discussion to
generate ideas and plans to create a computer game in which players

<A HREF="http://spring-alpha.org/">http://spring-alpha.org</A> &gt;&gt;&quot;spring_alpha&quot; is a networked game system
set in an industrialised council estate whose inhabitants are
attempting to create their own autonomous society in contrast to that
of the regime in which they live. The game serves as a &quot;sketch pad&quot;
for testing out alternative forms of social practice at both the
&quot;narrative&quot; level, in terms of the game story, and at a &quot;code&quot; level,
as players are able to re-write the code that runs the simulated
world. The original narrative is based on a series of drawings by Chad
McCail, &quot;Spring&quot; and &quot;Evolution is Not Over yet&quot;, which also shape the
game's visual style. The original stories and images become a
framework that is fleshed-out by people's own ideas and experiences.
The basic aim of the game is to change the rules by which the society
in that world runs. This is done through hacking and altering the code
that simulates that world, creating new types of behaviour and social
interaction. How effective this becomes depends on the players'
ability to spread these new ideas into the society.

<A HREF="http://gammalow.sf.net/">http://GammaLow.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;Gamma Low is a multiplayer strategy game in
which two teams of light-based life-forms fight for the dominance over

Spirits) and the working/attacking force, the Lights.

==3D, Quake*
<A HREF="http://xreal.sf.net/">http://XreaL.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;XreaL will be a non-commercial multiplayer only
first person shooter based on a heavily modified Quake 3 Arena engine
(id Tech 3).  The aim is to push the rendering technology until it can
be compared with current commercial titles and then to produce a
playable Total Conversion.  Quake 3 Arena's gameplay will be only
slightly modified.  The simpleness of the original game will stay but
the game media will be replaced completely with high quality assets
that match the new engine's technology.

very nice for today's standards.  I don't know the reason why nobody
had any interest in it, I've seen several ports of Hexen, Heretic and
Doom but nobody did a Wolfenstein port.

<A HREF="http://tenebrae.sf.net/">http://Tenebrae.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;Tenebrae is a modification of the quake
source that adds stencil shadows and per pixel lights to quake.
Stencil shadows allow for realistic shadow effects on every object in

used by the new Doom game.

1000 kilobytes in size: More than twice the size of TomazQuake.  It
may not have as much super-effects as Tenebrae, but I don't think the
Quake monsters would keep the wall/floor that squeaky clean

universe where fearless pilots fight to the death with their
futuristic vehicles. Gameplay lies somewhere between the
Mechwarrior-series and Quake 3. It is faster and more
action-orientated than in Mechwarrior, but tries to avoid the
'jump-around-like-crazy-and-fire-at-everything-that-moves'-gameplay
known from Quake 3.
<A HREF="http://westernquake3.net/">http://WesternQuake3.net</A> &gt;&gt;Now I'm not saying that the current team

firstly in Poland and then in other countries.
<A HREF="http://alphashooter.sf.net/">http://AlphaShooter.sf.net</A> &gt;&gt;Alpha Shooter was born as a project for
the Computer Graphics course at the University of Bologna. The main
objective was to develop a very simple 3D game using the OpenGL, GLU
and GLUT libraries only (and some creativity). Emphasis was not placed
on the game itself, rather on learning how to use the libraries to
produce a 3D environment and interact with it; it was thus required to
build a suitable scenery using polygonal meshes and quadric surfaces,
appropriate textures and materials, lights, and effects.
<A HREF="http://triptico.com/splumber">http://TRIPTICO.com/splumber</A> &gt;&gt;Space Plumber is a first-person 3d
game, not much different to Doom and Quake. The main goal is to reach
the extraction pumps before the water level increases swamping
everything. Each of the 30 levels that conform the game have
progressive difficulty by adding more pumps and consoles that you must
deactivate first, and by making the map bigger. There are no enemies,
you fight against time and misorientation, and you only have your
skills to move inside the maze.
