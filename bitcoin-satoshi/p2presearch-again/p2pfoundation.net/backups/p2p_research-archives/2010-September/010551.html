Dear friends,

This is an excellent program, and alex burns is right on target in his
understanding of produsage ... I was actually accepted for the 2010 program
myself but had to decline because it was not compatible with my family's
sustainability .. but if you're single, this is strongly recommended,

Michel

*PhD research opportunities at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative
Industries and Innovation in 2011*



Undertaking your PhD at the *ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative
Industries and Innovation (CCI)* means you will be working with world class
researchers who can offer supervision of the highest standards. Our research
activities cover a broad range of emerging issues, themes and projects
across the entertainment and creative industries including innovation and
policy development; significant project collaborations with Asia; a major
project looking at broadband services; mapping the creative industries; IP
law; a global cultural futures study and other projects which engage
community and industry partners in creative industries from major film
studios to the Salvation Army and &#8216;at-risk&#8217; young people working as media
co-creators.



*About the CCI*

The *ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation
(CCI)*was established in 2005 to focus research and development on the
role the
creative industries and their contributing disciplines make to a more
dynamic and inclusive innovation system and society.

With core support from the Australian Research Council from 2005-13, it is
acknowledged as a global leader in this emerging field. It is a
broadly-based, cross-disciplinary, internationally-focused centre embracing
both fundamental theoretical, and highly applied, research in media,
cultural and communication studies, law, education, economics and business
and information technology, addressing key problems and opportunities
arising for Australia, the Asian region, and more broadly in the world, from
innovation in and through the creative economy.

The Centre&#8217;s administering institution is the Queensland University of
Technology in Brisbane, Australia. The core collaborating partners are
Swinburne University of Technology (VIC), Australian Film Television and
Radio School (NSW), Edith Cowan University (WA), University of Wollongong
(NSW) and the University of New South Wales.

The Centre's research projects are organised around four key themes:

   - Conceptual Modelling
   - Digital Innovations
   - Policy and Macro-Trends
   - Skills and Creative Capital

Within these four themes, a number of past and current projects span a wide
range of interests and topics. We encourage you to visit the CCI Projects
Page at: *<A HREF="http://www.cci.edu.au/projects">http://www.cci.edu.au/projects</A> *to find out more about the
Centre&#8217;s activities.



*Undertaking a PhD at CCI*

A PhD at CCI gives you the chance to undertake in-depth study in a specific
area, by way of independent learning combined with the mentoring of
internationally renowned researchers.

Graduate research students at CCI have a passion for their topics and fields
of research. They take the opportunity to examine important problems at the
cutting edge of their disciplines. A list of current CCI research students
and their topics is available at:
<A HREF="http://www.cci.edu.au/content/current-research-students.">http://www.cci.edu.au/content/current-research-students.</A>

Applicants would normally have completed a recognised Australian master's
degree by research or bachelor's degree with first or second class honours
(division 1).

To support you in your research studies, The Commonwealth Government
Department of Education provides Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA) which
are tenable at an Australian tertiary institution for doctoral and masters
research degrees. The scholarships are each valued at $22,500 (tax free) per
annum with additional relocation and thesis allowances. Competition for the
APA is high.

Prospective students, both domestic and international, may also apply for
university awarded post graduate scholarships. Some of these offer a living
allowance comparable to the APA scholarships as well as offering a number of
top-up scholarships. For further information on scholarships, including each
University&#8217;s internal deadlines, see the following links:

involvement in creative and performing arts research has seen her contribute
to critiques of practice-led methods that lead to non-traditional research
outputs. Lelia is particularly keen to supervise students who wish to
research young people&#8217;s use of the internet and/or online communities.
