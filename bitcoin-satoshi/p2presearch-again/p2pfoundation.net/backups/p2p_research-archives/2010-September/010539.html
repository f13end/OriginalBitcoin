OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA CAMP
===========================

Save the date! From the 18-19th November 2010, the Open Knowledge Foundation
will host an international workshop on open government data in London:

 <A HREF="http://opengovernmentdata.org/camp2010/">http://opengovernmentdata.org/camp2010/</A>

The event will be an opportinity to meet movers and shakers in the world of
open government data including government representatives, policymakers,
lawyers, technologists, academics, advocates, citizens, journalists, and
re-users.

Open Government Data Camp is supported by the Cabinet Office, UK; EU LAPSI
project, Turin, Italy; EU LOD2 project, Leipzig, Germany; Guardian, UK; and
Sunlight Foundation, USA.


PANTON PRINCIPLES WIN
======================

We were delighted to hear that the authors of the Panton Principles have
been given a SPARC Innovators award!

 <A HREF="http://pantonprinciples.org/">http://pantonprinciples.org/</A>

The principles are currently maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation&#8217;s
working group on Open Data in Science. Working group member Peter Murray
Rust is starting a series of papers on issues related to the Panton
Principles, which BioMed Central have kindly offered to publish.

If you&#8217;d like to join the debate, you can sign up to the open-science
discussion list:

 <A HREF="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science">http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science</A>


RUFUS POLLOCK ON NEW UK TRANSPARENCY BOARD
==============================================

We&#8217;re also pleased to announce that OKF Director Rufus Pollock has been
invited to be a member of the UK government's new Public Sector Transparency
Board, which will help to drive forward the Government&#8217;s transparency
agenda. Further information is available here:

<A HREF="http://blog.okfn.org/2010/06/28/new-uk-transparency-board-and-public-data-principles/">http://blog.okfn.org/2010/06/28/new-uk-transparency-board-and-public-data-principles/</A>

If you have any ideas about how governments can continue to open up data,
you're welcome to pitch in on the OKF's Open Government discuss list:

<A HREF="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government">http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government</A>


 WHERE DOES MY MONEY GO? THE DATA HUNT CONTINUES!
===================================================

There was excitement all round, and especially from the OKF's Where Does My
Money Go team, when back in June the UK's new government committed to
opening up more data.
We launched a new interface to the COINS data, the biggest database of UK
spending data:

 <A HREF="http://coins.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/">http://coins.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/</A>

We've also been working on new visualisations of the budget and deficit gap:

 <A HREF="http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/budget/">http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/budget/</A>
 <A HREF="http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/cuts/interactive/">http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/cuts/interactive/</A>

 To keep up to date with the project you can join the discuss-list here:

CKAN.NET &lt;<A HREF="http://ckan.net/">http://ckan.net/</A>&gt; GOES INTERNATIONAL!
=============================

Exciting news from CKAN, where the Italian, Norwegian, and German instances
are now live! You can see them at:

 <A HREF="http://it.ckan.net/">http://it.ckan.net/</A>
 <A HREF="http://no.ckan.net/">http://no.ckan.net</A>
 <A HREF="http://de.ckan.net/">http://de.ckan.net</A>

We&#8217;re also proud to note that the Canadian citizen-driven data catalogue is
being powered by CKAN:

 <A HREF="http://datadotgc.ca/">http://datadotgc.ca</A>

There are currently 67 packages available on it.ckan.net, while there are
already 136 packages online at no.ckan.net which is a fantastic start! If
you are interested in starting an instance of CKAN for open (government)
data in your country, drop us a line on our ckan-discuss list, where there
is a growing group of developers and translators who can help you to get
something up and running:

NEW OKF WORKING GROUPS
=======================

Recently, the OKF&#8217;s series of working groups (WGs) has been expanding. A
surge of member activity has brought new ideas bubbling up to the surface,
from the collaborations and interests of the community. We&#8217;re happy to
welcome to the working group stable: Open Archaeology, Open Cultural
Heritage, and Open Data in Linguistics.

 <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/archaeology">http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/archaeology</A>
 <A HREF="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-heritage">http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-heritage</A>
 <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/linguistics">http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/linguistics</A>

One of the objectives of the Open Data in Linguistics WG is to maintain a
registry of collections of open corpora, dictionaries and other linguistic
resources on CKAN:

 <A HREF="http://ckan.net/tag/linguistics">http://ckan.net/tag/linguistics</A>

If you&#8217;d like to get involved in a working group, whether you&#8217;ve got 5
minutes or 5 days to spare, find out which of our current 13 active WGs
matches your interests here:

PRINCIPLES FOR OPENING UP GOVERNMENT FINANCES
===============================================

The OKF&#8217;s Working Group on Open Government Data has released a new set of
initiatives on publishing government finances:

 <A HREF="http://www.opengovernmentdata.org/finances/">http://www.opengovernmentdata.org/finances/</A>

Whether you're in the UK or abroad, we'd love to have your comments! Please
dive in, on the open government data discuss-list:

 <A HREF="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government">http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government</A>


NEW STUDY CHARTS HISTORY OF OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA
===================================================

A new report released late last month, and written by OKF board member Becky
Hogge, charts the history of open government data in the UK and the US.


<A HREF="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information/focus/communication/articles_publications/publications/open-data-study-20100519/open-data-study-100519.pdf">http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information/focus/communication/articles_publications/publications/open-data-study-20100519/open-data-study-100519.pdf</A>

Written for a consortium of grant-giving organisations including the Hewlett
Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Omidyar Network, the Open Society
Institute, and DfID, the Open Data Study draws some new and surprising
conclusions, as well as recognising the role of organisations like the OKF
and mySociety in bringing about data.gov.uk.


OKF EXTENDS ITS OPEN BORDERS: OKF GERMANY LAUNCHED
=====================================================

We are delighted to announce the launch of the Open Knowledge Foundation
Germany, which took place at the Leipzig Semantic Web Day in May 2010:

 <A HREF="http://okfn.de/">http://okfn.de/</A>

&#8211;  Scientist and OKF Advisory Board Member Peter Murray Rust has been
spreading the OKF and Open Data word recently, at both the Open Science
Summit 2010 (held in July at Berkeley) and at Sci Foo, the annual,
interdisciplinary, invitation-only scientific 'unconference' organized by
Nature Publishing Group, Google, and O'Reilly Media. Not a fan of
powerpoint, he&#8217;s come up with a new presentation tool!
<A HREF="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2517">http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2517</A>

&#8211; Open Knowledge Foundation Director Rufus Pollock and Chris Taggart of
OpenlyLocal were asked by The Daily Telegraph what UK government datasets
they&#8217;d like to see opened up next. Find out what they said here:
<A HREF="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/conradquiltyharper/100046396/the-government-has-unlocked-the-open-data-safe-now-we-must-open-it/">http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/conradquiltyharper/100046396/the-government-has-unlocked-the-open-data-safe-now-we-must-open-it/</A>

&#8211; Open Data Commons has released a new Open Data Commons attribution license
(ODC-By): <A HREF="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/">http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/</A>

&#8211; Cologne-based libraries and the Library Centre of Rhineland-Palatinate
(LBZ) in cooperation with the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre
(hbz) are the first German libraries to adopt the idea of Open Access for
bibliographic data by publishing their catalogue data for free public use:
so we&#8217;re delighted to be able to add a koeln-library-data package to the
bibliographic data group on CKAN: <A HREF="http://www.ckan.net/group/bibliographic">http://www.ckan.net/group/bibliographic</A>

&#8211; Members of the OKF were given the honour of judging open access publisher
BioMed Central&#8217;s new Open Data Award: John Wilbanks, Peter Murray-Rust, and
Rufus Pollock were part of the judging panel. You can read more on the
awards, and the winning articles here:
<A HREF="http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/opendata/">http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/opendata/</A>

&#8211; OKF member David Read gave a talk on open data and coding the
data.gov.uksite, as well as information on the OKF and CKAN at
EuroPython 2010 (The
European Python Conference) held in Birmingham in July.

&#8211; Chris Taggart, of OpenlyLocal, has been delivering a raft of exciting and
useful information for UK locales, based on local data, including an open
data scoreboard for local authorities (showing whether they are publishing
open data) as well as local council finances and spending:

OTHER NEWS IN BRIEF
===================

&#8211; Just a reminder that the P2P Foundation carries a lot of useful resources
on developments that are based on commons for open knowledge, software and
code: <A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Open">http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Open</A>

&#8211; Iceland recently put into practice the IMMI (Icelandic Modern Media
Initiative), passing legislation to strengthen free speech, among other
issues. The legislation does not specifically talk about Open Data, but it
clearly has many implications that are related. Visit the IMMI website for
more details <A HREF="http://immi.is/">http://immi.is/</A> or see our recent OKF blog post:
<A HREF="http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/26/iceland-from-the-financial-crisis-to-open-data/">http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/26/iceland-from-the-financial-crisis-to-open-data/</A>

&#8211; As OKF member Chris Gutteridge points out, &#8220;just because knowledge is
open, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true&#8221; and he&#8217;s even created some &#8220;silly&#8221; RDF
datasets to prove his point. Enjoy! <A HREF="http://data.totl.net/">http://data.totl.net/</A>
