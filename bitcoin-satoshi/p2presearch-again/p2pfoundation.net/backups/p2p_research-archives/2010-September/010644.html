Handbook on Knowledge Economy, Education and Digital Futures

(Eds.) Michael A. Peters, Tina (A.C.) Besley and Daniel Araya

Rationale

The movement to the knowledge economy requires a rethinking of economic
fundamentals because knowledge behaves differently from other goods in that
it shares many of the properties of a &#8216;global&#8217; public good. This means a key
role for governments in protecting intellectual property rights. It also
signals also dangers of monopolization given the economies of scale to be
achieved in information systems that may be even greater for knowledge
economies than for industrial economies. In more technical terms knowledge
is  non-rivalrous, that is, knowledge once discovered and made public,
operates expansively to defy the normal &#8216;law&#8217; of scarcity that governs most
commodity markets. Knowledge in its immaterial or conceptual forms &#8211; ideas,
information, concepts, functions and abstract objects of thought &#8211; is purely
non-rivalrous, that is, there is essentially zero marginal costs to adding
more users. Yet once materially embodied or encoded, such as in learning or
in applications or processes, knowledge becomes costly in time and
resources. The pure non-rivalrousness of knowledge can be differentiated
from the low cost of its dissemination, resulting from improvements in
electronic media and technology, although there may be congestion effects
and waiting time (to reserve a book, or download from the Internet). These
new principles of the economics of knowledge carry over to knowledge
institutions and countries as a whole and define new development
trajectories. The privatization of global knowledge has serious consequences
for the open global society and knowledge hoarding can seriously damage the
trust relationship so important for learning societies. Changes in economic
institutions have counterparts in the political sphere where institutions of
the open society such as a free press and transparent government both enable
and protect pluralism, toleration, freedom of thought, and open public
debate. Political openness is essential for the success of the
transformation towards a knowledge economy through investment in new open
architectures of knowledge and learning provide development possibilities
that can play an important role in stimulating the global economy preserving
and increasing the role of open science and offering new architectures of a
future post-crisis global economy.



Section 1: Knowledge economy, openness and education

Section editor: Michael A. Peters



The terms &#8216;open knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;open knowledge production&#8217; are now well
accepted in the literature to refer to a range of related models of &#8216;peer
production&#8217; and &#8216;peer governance&#8217; that provide an emerging alternative to
traditional proprietary models of knowledge production. The concept of
&#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;openness&#8217; deserves special attention because it has come to
christen a range of related activities concerned with the advantages of
decentralized distributed networks that characterize &#8216;commons-based peer
production&#8217; and increasingly defines the political economy of the digital
networked environment.



The Ithaca Report, University Publishing In A Digital Age (2007) indicates
that there have been huge changes in creation, production and consumption of
scholarly resources with the &#8216;creation of new formats made possible by
digital technologies, ultimately allowing scholars to work in deeply
integrated electronic research and publishing environments that will enable
real-time dissemination, collaboration, dynamically-updated content, and
usage of new media&#8217; (p. 4). As the report goes on to mention alongside these
changes in content creation and publication &#8216;alternative distribution models
(institutional repositories, pre-print servers, open access journals) have
also arisen with the aim to broaden access, reduce costs, and enable open
sharing of content&#8217; (p. 4).  We can consider open publishing, open access
and archiving as parts of the wider movements called Open Science and Open
Education that build on the nested and evolving convergences of open source,
open access and open science, and also emblematic of a set of still wider
political and economic changes that ushers in &#8216;social production&#8217; as an
aspect of the global digital economy, an economy that is both fragile and
volatile as the current world credit and banking crisis demonstrates so
well.





Section2: Social networking, new media, and social entrepreneurship in
education



Section editor: Tina (A.C.) Besley



The history of scientific communication demonstrates that the typical form
of the scientific article presented in print-based journals in essay form is
a result of development over two centuries beginning in seventeenth century
with the emergence of learned societies and cooperation among scientists.  The
emergence of electronic forms of scientific communication can be traced back
at least to Ted Nelson&#8217;s notion of &#8216;hypertext&#8217; which he coined in 1963 and
went on to develop as a hypertext system. It is important to recognize that
the concept of &#8216;information&#8217; emerged from the combination of the development
of modern military intelligence (breaking codes, deciphering messages,
encoding information, resolving conflict of sources etc.) and the
development of new communication technologies. The consequences of the
networking of science and culture have yet to be worked through fully yet
the new definition of multiliteracies is synonymous with computer literacy
and while it is the case that the computer signifies the end of traditional
print literacy it does not signify the end of literacy. The Web has now
spawned a whole set of new media genres and the Internet has been accepted
into education enthusiastically and in a way that previous technologies like
television were not.


Section 3: Technology, innovation, and participatory networks

Section editor: Daniel Araya

Developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) not only
frame globalization but are changing the format and density of the flows of
knowledge, research and innovation. Over the past four decades, ICTs have
been instrumental in the development of new modes of work, play and
learning. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, flickr, Second Life,
World of Warcraft, Wikipedia, Ning and YouTube are generating new models of
production and consumption that are changing the rules of commercial
industry. Shifts away from top-down, command-and-control systems, and
towards participatory collaboration have become critical to emerging social
and business platforms. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have become a
particularly important factor in this process. Moving beyond the one-to-many
production regimes undergirding industrialization, P2P networks are enabling
participatory innovation. P2P networks significantly lower the barriers to
design and distribution, and transform traditional notions of authority and
expertise. Serving as platforms for user participation, networks are now an
important organizing logic for economic and cultural innovation. This
section explores these trends in terms of varied themes including:


&#183;      Open Learning and Open Innovation

&#183;      Cyberinfrastructure, Gaming and Digital Media Design

&#183;      Distributed Information Systems, P2P Networks and Collective
Intelligence

&#183;      Cyberlearning Policy, E-Learning, and National Systems of Innovation

&#183;      Creativity, Complexity, and Self-Organization
