<PRE>I'm still waiting for my own review copy, but what from what I've seen from
the draft chapters, this is a really important book regarding peer
governance and an outline of the different forms of human solidarities and
how they interact.

I.e. the author distinguishes: markets, hierarchies, egalitarianism and
'fatalism' and a fifth integrative form of relationship called &quot;Autonomy&quot;

The book is: *Organising and Disorganising: A Dynamic and Non-Linear Theory
of Institutional Emergence and its Implications. Dr Michael Thompson.
Triarchy Press, 2008* and is presented in detail here at

<A HREF="http://p2pfoundation.net/Organising_and_Disorganising">http://p2pfoundation.net/Organising_and_Disorganising</A>

The publisher kindly offers us a 40% discount:

 Michel,

Do offer the second one to another reviewer - thank you.  It was posted
yesterday.

Ok - attached a synopsis from the book on the 'autonomous' position.

And here &lt;<A HREF="http://triarchypress.co.uk/pages/book16.htm">http://triarchypress.co.uk/pages/book16.htm</A>&gt; is the link for
orders.  We can offer readers of your blog 40% discount off the list price

oh, I didn't know you send one, sorry for that ...

the books usually arrive, and it may still yet arrive ...

Can I offer the second one, if I end up getting to, to our community in case
a second reviewer turns up for another source?

</I>&gt;<i>  Some time ago&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/book-of-the-week-michael-thompsons-theory-of-governance/2008/11/03">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/book-of-the-week-michael-thompsons-theory-of-governance/2008/11/03</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> we introduced Michael Thompson's book as Book of the Week, but we did not
</I>&gt;<i> get the excerpts in time to do a follow-up the same week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a reminder, this books (*Organising and Disorganising&lt;<A HREF="http://www.p2pfoundation.net/Organising_and_Disorganising">http://www.p2pfoundation.net/Organising_and_Disorganising</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> A Dynamic and Non-Linear Theory of Institutional Emergence and its
</I>&gt;<i> Implications*) posits five different solidarities or types of
</I>&gt;<i> intersubjective relations, and it puzzled me how it could be squared with
</I>&gt;<i> the typology that is at the basis of my own theorizing on peer to peer, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> Alan Page Fiske's relational grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But after receiving chapter 2 for excerpting, I now understand how the
</I>&gt;<i> approaches complement each other. The four basic solidarities of Thompson
</I>&gt;<i> can be matched with the fourfold typology of Fiske, and the fifth, which
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Thompson calls autonomy (the way of the hermit), is an integration
</I>&gt;<i> of the other four, that avoids their coercion and totalitarian tendencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, the way of the market, the way of hierarchy, the way of
</I>&gt;<i> egalitarianism and the way of fatalism are each based on different
</I>&gt;<i> metaphysical assumptions, views of nature and man that cannot be proven but
</I>&gt;<i> are strongly adhered to, and each category's adherents tries to mold the
</I>&gt;<i> world to its own image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are therefore inherently coercive. Obviously, if our own peer to peer
</I>&gt;<i> approach where to be this first stage egalitarianism, it would be coercive
</I>&gt;<i> as well, and I believe that it isn't. Since none of the four can ever be
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated as a basic feeling of the universe, we cannot propose a system
</I>&gt;<i> that wipes the other out; however, it is legitimate I believe to think that
</I>&gt;<i> just as the 3 other solidarities were once dominant, the fourth, peer to
</I>&gt;<i> peer or communal shareholding, can also becoming a core organizing principle
</I>&gt;<i> of society. But it should be a non-coercive core, which honours the other 3
</I>&gt;<i> modes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the excerpts from Michael Thompson, i.e. an explanation of the
</I>&gt;<i> four solidarities followed by what cultural theory can bring to their
</I>&gt;<i> understanding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Michael Thompson (Chapter 2):*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;** For upholders of the individualist solidarity, nature is benign - able
</I>&gt;<i> to recover from any exploitation (hence the iconic myth of nature,
</I>&gt;<i> illustrated in Figure 2.1: a ball that, no matter how profoundly disturbed,
</I>&gt;<i> always returns to stability) - and man is inherently self-seeking and
</I>&gt;<i> atomistic (i.e. the way the methodological individualists assume man is).
</I>&gt;<i> Trial and error, in self-organising ego-focused networks (markets), is the
</I>&gt;<i> way to go, with Adam Smith's invisible hand ensuring that people only do
</I>&gt;<i> well when others also benefit. Individualists, in consequence, trust others
</I>&gt;<i> until they give them reason not to and then retaliate in kind (the winning
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tit for tat&quot; strategy in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game [Rapoport
</I>&gt;<i> 1985]). They see it as only fair that (as in the joint stock company) those
</I>&gt;<i> who put most in get most out. Managing institutions that work &quot;with the
</I>&gt;<i> grain of the market&quot; (getting rid of environmentally harmful subsidies, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance) are what are needed.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Nature, for those who bind themselves into the egalitarian solidarity,
</I>&gt;<i> is almost the exact opposite (hence the ball on the upturned basin) - fragile,
</I>&gt;<i> intricately interconnected and ephemeral - and man is essentially caring and
</I>&gt;<i> sharing (until corrupted by coercive and inegalitarian institutions:
</I>&gt;<i> markets and hierarchies). We must all tread lightly on the Earth, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> not enough that people start off equal; they must end up equal as well -
</I>&gt;<i> equality of result. Trust and levelling go hand in hand, and institutions
</I>&gt;<i> that distribute unequally are distrusted. Voluntary simplicity is the only
</I>&gt;<i> solution to our environmental problems, with the &quot;precautionary principle&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> being strictly enforced on those who are tempted not to share the simple
</I>&gt;<i> life.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** The world, in the hierarchical solidarity, is controllable. Nature is
</I>&gt;<i> stable until pushed beyond discoverable limits (hence the two humps), and
</I>&gt;<i> man is malleable: deeply flawed but redeemable by firm, long-lasting and
</I>&gt;<i> trustworthy institutions (i.e. the way the methodological collectivists
</I>&gt;<i> assume man is, as in &quot;Give me the boy and I will give you the man&quot;). Fair
</I>&gt;<i> distribution is by rank and station or, in the modern context, by need (with
</I>&gt;<i> the level of need being determined by expert and dispassionate authority).
</I>&gt;<i> Environmental management requires certified experts (to determine the
</I>&gt;<i> precise locations of nature's limits) and statutory regulation (to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> that all economic activity is then kept within those limits).*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Fatalist actors (or perhaps we should say non-actors, since their voice
</I>&gt;<i> is seldom heard in policy debates; if it was they wouldn't be fatalistic!) find
</I>&gt;<i> neither rhyme nor reason in nature, and know that man is fickle and
</I>&gt;<i> untrustworthy. Fairness, in consequence, is not to be found in this life,
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no possibility of effecting change for the better. &quot;Defect
</I>&gt;<i> first&quot; - the winning strategy in the one-off Prisoner's Dilemma - makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense here, given the unreliability of communication and the permanent
</I>&gt;<i> absence of prior acts of good faith. With no way of ever getting in sync
</I>&gt;<i> with nature (push the ball this way or that and the feedback is everywhere
</I>&gt;<i> the same), or of building trust with others, the fatalist's world (unlike
</I>&gt;<i> those of the other three solidarities) is one in which learning is
</I>&gt;<i> impossible. &quot;Why bother?&quot;, therefore, is the rational management response.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *These solidarities, in varying strengths and patterns of pairwise
</I>&gt;<i> alliance, are clearly discernible almost anywhere you care to look: in
</I>&gt;<i> debates over water engineering in South Asia (Gyawali 2001); in the
</I>&gt;<i> international fora where delegates struggle to do something about climate
</I>&gt;<i> change (Thompson, Rayner and Ney 1998; Verweij 2001); in the different ways
</I>&gt;<i> international regimes cope with trans-boundary risks such as water pollution
</I>&gt;<i> (Verweij 2000) and municipalities go about the business of transport
</I>&gt;<i> planning (Hendriks 1994); in the various ways households set about making
</I>&gt;<i> ends meet (Dake and Thompson 1999); in the different diagnoses of the
</I>&gt;<i> pensions crisis in countries with ageing populations (Ney 1997); and in the
</I>&gt;<i> different panaceas that are variously championed and rejected by theorists
</I>&gt;<i> of public administration (Hood 1998), to mention but a few.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In all these examples we find that each solidarity, in creating a context
</I>&gt;<i> that is shaped by its distinctive premises, generates a storyline that
</I>&gt;<i> inevitably contradicts those that are generated by the other solidarities.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, since each distils certain elements of experience and wisdom that are
</I>&gt;<i> missed by the others, and since each provides a clear expression of the
</I>&gt;<i> way in which a significant portion of the populace feels we should live with
</I>&gt;<i> one another and with nature, it is important that they all be taken into
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of account in the policy process. That, in essence, is the case
</I>&gt;<i> for clumsiness: the case that I have tried to be persuasive about in the
</I>&gt;<i> previous chapter*.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. A Cultural Theory of these patterns*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Michael Thompson (Chapter 2):*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;*A quick recapitulation of the argument so far - a recapitulation,
</I>&gt;<i> moreover, that brings in the fifth solidarity - is a sensible first step on
</I>&gt;<i> the way to this proper theory, and it can be set out in the form of five
</I>&gt;<i> crucial observations. All five are to do with what is involved in going
</I>&gt;<i> from the classic markets-and-hierarchies distinction to the cultural theory
</I>&gt;<i> scheme with its five &quot;eddies&quot;: its five recurrent regularities within an
</I>&gt;<i> endless transactional flux.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Economic incentives and (or, perhaps, versus) social sanctions&quot; is one
</I>&gt;<i> way of explaining the markets-and-hierarchies framing. Hierarchies enforce
</I>&gt;<i> the law of contract, without which markets would not work, and they also do
</I>&gt;<i> other vital things (such as repelling enemies); markets then get on with the
</I>&gt;<i> wealth-creating process of innovating, bidding and bargaining. Each, we can
</I>&gt;<i> see, needs the other, though of course there is always considerable
</I>&gt;<i> disagreement about just where the line between these two transactional
</I>&gt;<i> realms should be drawn - most famously, perhaps, in the titanic struggle, in
</I>&gt;<i> the first half of the last century, between Keynes and Hayek. Keynes wanted
</I>&gt;<i> a major role for hierarchy; Hayek saw that as &quot;The Road To Serfdom&quot; (Hayek
</I>&gt;<i> 1944) and wanted the line pushed back as far as it would go. Either way, as
</I>&gt;<i> Keynes pointed out, a line has to be drawn, thereby winning on points, as it
</I>&gt;<i> were (&quot;Game, set and match&quot;, in the estimation of his most recent biographer
</I>&gt;<i> [Skidelski 2000 p285]).*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The same sort of uneasy symbiosis is evident in what is called &quot;the new
</I>&gt;<i> institutional economics&quot; (which, since it goes back to Williamson's 1975
</I>&gt;<i> book, is really quite long in the tooth: a bit like Oxford's New College,
</I>&gt;<i> which was new in the fourteenth century). In this framing, spiralling
</I>&gt;<i> transaction costs (as changing technology, for instance, renders quality
</I>&gt;<i> control more difficult and expensive) lead to market failure and to the
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy having to step in to set prices; and, conversely, markets taking
</I>&gt;<i> over when transaction costs fall (as, for instance, they recently have - to
</I>&gt;<i> almost zero - on the Internet). Each of these ways of organising, moreover,
</I>&gt;<i> is seen as promoting a distinctive rationality - procedural and substantive
</I>&gt;<i> as they are sometimes called: hierarchies being primarily concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> propriety (&quot;Who has the right to do what and to whom?&quot;); markets being much
</I>&gt;<i> more outcome-focused (&quot;The bottom line&quot;). In this way, each rationality
</I>&gt;<i> legitimises one of these ways of organising and, in so doing, renders it
</I>&gt;<i> viable in an environment that contains the other.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Cultural theory does not reject this classic distinction, but it does add
</I>&gt;<i> the following crucial observations:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1. You cannot have hierarchies without hierarchists, nor markets without
</I>&gt;<i> individualists.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *That is, the organisational requirements of the whole - the pattern of
</I>&gt;<i> relationships - must somehow be internalised by the parts. The
</I>&gt;<i> pattern-making, in other words, goes both ways - from the whole to the parts
</I>&gt;<i> and from the parts to the whole - and this goes on in such a way as to
</I>&gt;<i> strengthen that pattern and differentiate it from the other patterns. In
</I>&gt;<i> this way (and like the chicken and the egg) each becomes the cause of the
</I>&gt;<i> other: we create the patterns and the patterns create us. Individuality, in
</I>&gt;<i> consequence, is not within each of us but between us: the individual, in Jon
</I>&gt;<i> Elster's memorable phrase, is inherently relational.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. If two rationalities are justifiable, as they obviously are here, then
</I>&gt;<i> the upholders of those rationalities will have to have different convictions
</I>&gt;<i> as to how the world is and people are: different social constructions of
</I>&gt;<i> nature, physical and human. Otherwise they could not justify their different
</I>&gt;<i> actions as being self-evidently sensible and moral, the world and people
</I>&gt;<i> being the way each of them insists they are. And, for contradictory
</I>&gt;<i> certainties such as these to persist, there must always be sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> uncertainty as to how the world, and the people in it, really are.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *3. Since markets institute equality (of opportunity) and promote
</I>&gt;<i> competition whilst hierarchies institute inequality (status differences) and
</I>&gt;<i> restrain competition, there are two discriminators at work here.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *A full typology, therefore, should contain the other two permutations:
</I>&gt;<i> equality without competition (egalitarianism) and inequality with
</I>&gt;<i> competition (fatalism).*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *4. Since it is possible to contemplate both hierarchies and markets
</I>&gt;<i> without having to be convinced that either's version - of how the world is
</I>&gt;<i> and people are - is true, and since the same holds for egalitarianism and
</I>&gt;<i> fatalism, there may well be a fifth way of organising (it is called
</I>&gt;<i> autonomy) that is stabilized by the deliberate avoidance of the sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> coercive involvement that are entailed in the other four. However, hermits
</I>&gt;<i> (as the upholders of autonomy have been dubbed) do not transcend the social
</I>&gt;<i> sphere, because they stabilize their distinctive way of organising in
</I>&gt;<i> contradistinction to the others. If the four &quot;socially engaged&quot; forms of
</I>&gt;<i> solidarity were not there the autonomous life would not be liveable. The
</I>&gt;<i> objection - &quot;four permutations and five solidarities&quot; - recedes once we
</I>&gt;<i> realise that the cross-over point of our two discriminators corresponds to a
</I>&gt;<i> rather strange &quot;all-zero&quot; permutation (this will become clearer in the next
</I>&gt;<i> chapter when these discriminators are recast, more correctly, as a
</I>&gt;<i> transaction matrix).*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *5. Though each pattern is made up of individuals and their transactions,
</I>&gt;<i> we should not assume that an individual is part of only one pattern.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Indeed, as Lockhart (1997) has pointed out, people who strive to keep all
</I>&gt;<i> their transactions on just one pattern are hard to live with - we call them
</I>&gt;<i> fanatics!*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *In general, if transactional spheres - workplace and home, for instance -
</I>&gt;<i> are fairly separate then an individual may lead different parts of his or
</I>&gt;<i> her life in different patterns. Just because we are physiologically
</I>&gt;<i> indivisible it does not follow that we are socially indivisible; hence the
</I>&gt;<i> need to think in terms of the dividual, and to take the form of social
</I>&gt;<i> solidarity (the pattern together with its viability conditions) as the unit
</I>&gt;<i> of analysis, not the individual.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *These, then, are the barest bones of cultural theory. In the chapters
</I>&gt;<i> that follow I will try to put some dynamic flesh on these bones
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly on the fifth bone - the form of solidarity as the unit of
</I>&gt;<i> analysis) and I will try to do this in a way that will make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> students of institutions: no easy task, given my anti-dualistic and
</I>&gt;<i> unobvious starting point. But cultural theory does have one thing in its
</I>&gt;<i> favour: its even-handedness. Where students of institutions have long been
</I>&gt;<i> faced with a stark choice - methodological individualism or methodological
</I>&gt;<i> collectivism - cultural theory offers a welcome, and perhaps surprising,
</I>&gt;<i> escape route: &quot;a plague on both your methodologies!*&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi allison,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would still appreciate part of a chapter, but I can't judge from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> titles, so can't give any recommendation ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps the one where he explains the five modes?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Thank you for the 2 chapters - we will have a read and get back to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Re the excerpts - would it be appropriate to have a chapter/part chapter
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on the blog?  And do you have a particular one that you think would be most

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Have a good lecture trip.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no experts received Allison .. I think you and Michael are playing ping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pong with this one &lt;g&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm already attaching 2 chapters of the manuscript to give you an idea
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is a bad time for me to work on dossier's, as I'm preparing a
