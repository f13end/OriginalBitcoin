It seem that you understand me correctly.

What is expensive is differentiation.  Living in this special city in this
style of abode is expensive.  Sheer calories and basic shelter are of
minimal expense in any developed nation.  A worker of almost any sort can
make ends meet in undifferentiated locations...they can even consume
luxuries.  In equal shares?  No.  In basic shares yes.  Differentiation is
what costs and what people pay for.

What capitalism is, is specialization--rarity.  Or if you like, scarcity.
Innovation is the most common form of scarcity because it is protected.  The
incentive to deliver it, is based on its protection.  In other words, the
price of generic drugs drops dramatically when the patent expires...watch
Nexium in three or four years when it goes from one of the biggest earning
items on earth to a few pennies per pill.

The problem with labor now is that people cannot differentiation
themselves.  Skills are being surpassed by automation.  That's new in
history.  As it accelerates, labor will become free.  As each technical
domain stabilizes, that domain will become free.  Free is a sign that
differentiation is difficult.

The classic example is cell phones which are now made all around the Pacific
Rim essentially for free.  The basic foundry for manufacture is trivial.
There is no skill to speak of in operation.  Those are the businesses young
Chinese entrepreneurs seek out...the way US WW2 vets wanted to own a gas
station--easy, basic, stable and little skill.   If a field where no new
sorts of basic cell phones come forward, you get all sorts of market
entrants like that, and the price of the item falls to free.

I see it happening everywhere where huge natural resources are not required
in production.  If such resources are required, the price falls to the value
of the resources.   Labor and IP go to zero.

Ryan
