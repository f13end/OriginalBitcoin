</I>&gt;<i>  Quoting myself from there:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Think to affordable and open access to quality education, culture in
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; all its forms, communication or advanced health care. Think to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; services like weather forecasts reliable enough to minimize human
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; casualties or food waste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I judge the quality of life provided by an autonomous society model or
</I>&gt;<i>  lifestyle (also) from how it guarantees all these **functional
</I>&gt;<i>  outputs**, not from *what* it consumes or in which quantities.
</I>
I apologize if I mischaracterized your position.

&gt;<i>  &gt; The basic requirements of shelter and food can be met most
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; efficiently by adapting &quot;19th century technology,&quot; through new
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; configurations and techniques.
</I>
&gt;<i> I **never** said the contrary, so all this effort is not necessary. I
</I>&gt;<i>  say that to live well you need also need things or services that
</I>&gt;<i>  cannot be manufactured or managed on a local, small, P2P scale only.
</I>
Local, small and P2P are not interchangeable.  There may be some forms
of industrial production whose capital outlays rule out P2P, but which
can still be done on a comparatively small scale for a local market.

I think the important point is that P2P and other alternatives for the
household and informal economy don't have to be piggybacked on a
full-blown highly capitalized industrial economy with centralized
infrastructure, on the present model.  I believe that 1) the majority
of the average person's use-value can be produced via P2P, household,
informal and barter economies, or via manufacturing in small factories
serving local markets, 2) the amount of large-scale industry required
to support an economy centered on such small-scale methods will be a
small fraction of its present amount, and 3) the transportation
infrastructure needed to support this residual economy of large-scale
production will be of much smaller capacity than at present--mainly
light rail networks linking local economies.

&gt;<i>  &gt; A lot of it depends on what you mean by the &quot;grid.&quot;  Large scale power
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; consumption, which may be necessary in some cases, is not equivalent
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; to a grid.  Even the largest industrial projects, arguably, can be
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; most efficiently powered by generators scaled to the actual needs of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the facility itself, at the point of consumption.
</I>
&gt;<i> but I'm not the one who dislikes such scenarios. You don't have to
</I>&gt;<i>  tell this to me, I could have written this myself. Your example proves
</I>&gt;<i>  my point. It is just another case where, IMO, the small farm or
</I>&gt;<i>  community of idealists simply won't be able to be self-dependent and
</I>&gt;<i>  live decently in the long term. Not until they recreate, with many
</I>&gt;<i>  other communities some large organization which, at least in
</I>&gt;<i>  principle, is exactly what they were trying to escape and leave behind
</I>&gt;<i>  in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My point is simply that, if there is no way to become completely free
</I>&gt;<i>  of some centralization and/or and mass production and live decently
</I>&gt;<i>  (and frankly, I have read no proofs against this yet, just lots of
</I>&gt;<i>  nice dreams and wishes), it may make much sense not to try to get rid
</I>&gt;<i>  of it altogether (*) or at least it would be more intellectually
</I>&gt;<i>  honest to acknowledge it. The only reason why I engaged in the
</I>&gt;<i>  discussion which led to the article cited above was exactly reading
</I>&gt;<i>  claims of &quot;we're almost there yet, and that's a sustainable lifestyle&quot;
</I>
I think most here don't envision getting rid of it entirely--just a
radical downscaling of centralization and mass production, and a shift
in emphasis to decentralized production as the dominant form.
