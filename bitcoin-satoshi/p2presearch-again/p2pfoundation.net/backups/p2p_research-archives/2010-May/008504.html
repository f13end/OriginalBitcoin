</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A brief history of P2P education in the visual arts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think most would agree art school and approaches to art education
</I>&gt;<i> are in general quite different from the rest of academia. The study
</I>&gt;<i> and practice of contemporary art requires a certain amount of openness
</I>&gt;<i> and experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a student I found the emphasis on self directed creative
</I>&gt;<i> exploration and the development of ones own thinking and ideas
</I>&gt;<i> invaluable. Learning and exploring subjects of my own interest, on my
</I>&gt;<i> own terms, in my own time was incredibly liberating. This de-schooling
</I>&gt;<i> inspired a new confidence and appreciation for learning which had been
</I>&gt;<i> lost during years of difficulty in secondary education. This is not to
</I>&gt;<i> say that the courses where perfect. There where also some annoying
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions. The division of art students into separate departments
</I>&gt;<i> of sculpture, print and painting doesn&#8217;t make any sense when
</I>&gt;<i> contemporary arts practice is so interdisciplinary. This only made
</I>&gt;<i> things difficult for students looking for access to people, skills and
</I>&gt;<i> equipment. Students and staff often struggle to maintain fertile
</I>&gt;<i> ground for creativity. Art materials are expensive and studio space is
</I>&gt;<i> at a premium. Finance for equipment and resources are scarce and
</I>&gt;<i> competition between departments is high. More often than not finance
</I>&gt;<i> is directed to more practical courses those capable of proving their
</I>&gt;<i> value through more objective examinations and the ratings of
</I>&gt;<i> postgraduate employer satisfaction. The value of the arts and
</I>&gt;<i> humanities is difficult to measure in strict economic terms and as
</I>&gt;<i> such they suffer. The recent decision to terminate Philosophy at
</I>&gt;<i> Middlesex University a major center for research in the UK could be
</I>&gt;<i> seen as symptomatic of this trend. See here for further details &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=411482&amp;c=2">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=411482&amp;c=2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.edu-factory.org/">http://www.edu-factory.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the times we live in, widespread cuts in public sector funding
</I>&gt;<i> can only lead to further intensification of this process.
</I>&gt;<i> This epistemic bias leaves gaps in mainstream education and this is
</I>&gt;<i> where peer to peer learning steps in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A brief history of P2P education in the visual arts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inspired in part by the work of Rudolph Steiner and motivated by a
</I>&gt;<i> belief in the power of human creativity German artist Joseph Beuys
</I>&gt;<i> believed that art could be a catalyst for revolutionary change. He saw
</I>&gt;<i> everyone as an artist and society as a co-created social sculpture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence
</I>&gt;<i> that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is
</I>&gt;<i> capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social
</I>&gt;<i> system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in
</I>&gt;<i> order to build &#8216;A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART&#8217;&#8230; EVERY HUMAN BEING
</I>&gt;<i> IS AN ARTIST who &#8211; from his state of freedom &#8211; the position of freedom
</I>&gt;<i> that he experiences at first-hand &#8211; learns to determine the other
</I>&gt;<i> positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.&#8221; &#8211; Beuys
</I>&gt;<i> 1973
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beuys was a professor at the D&#252;sseldorf Academy of Arts from 1961
</I>&gt;<i> until 10th October, 1972.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The the day on which he was discharged by the education minister
</I>&gt;<i> Johannes Rau, for political reasons. Together with his students Beuys
</I>&gt;<i> occupied the secretary&#8217;s office to contest the decision about the
</I>&gt;<i> enrollment of students who have been refused admittance. He refers to
</I>&gt;<i> a previous senates decision which states that every teacher has the
</I>&gt;<i> right to admit as many students to his or her class as he or she sees
</I>&gt;<i> fit. The sacking of Beuys is the beginning of a long legally and
</I>&gt;<i> ideological dispute which is finally settled in favour of Beuys, with
</I>&gt;<i> a judgment handed down at the highest legally level.&#8221; &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.beuys.org/beuys_room20.htm">http://www.beuys.org/beuys_room20.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later that year Beuy&#8217;s set up the Free International University for
</I>&gt;<i> Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research. This was to be a free nexus
</I>&gt;<i> for sharing information, in which all the participants were both
</I>&gt;<i> students and teachers. Its aims where to break down boundaries between
</I>&gt;<i> art, community, culture and politics. From humble beginnings in the
</I>&gt;<i> informal atmosphere of Beuy&#8217;s D&#252;sseldorf studio Beuys and comrades
</I>&gt;<i> went on to establish Free Universities in Verlag, Amsterdam,
</I>&gt;<i> Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg and Munich. <A HREF="http://fiuwac.com/">http://fiuwac.com/</A> While plans for
</I>&gt;<i> a Free University in Dublin never took off Beuys had greater influence
</I>&gt;<i> north of the border where A.R.E Arts Research and Exchange applied
</I>&gt;<i> many of the FIU principles in Belfast. Subsequently this had a
</I>&gt;<i> significant impact on the history of visual arts in Ireland north and
</I>&gt;<i> south.
</I>&gt;<i> The influence of the Free International University is lasting.
</I>&gt;<i> Last week I slept on a bed made of balloons at a sleepover as part of
</I>&gt;<i> the reopening of the Model Niland Gallery in Sligo in the west of
</I>&gt;<i> Ireland.
</I>&gt;<i> The current exhibition &#8216;Dorm&#8217; includes works by 22 international
</I>&gt;<i> artist collectives. Many of whom I&#8217;m sure have at some point found
</I>&gt;<i> inspiration in Beuys ideas. One group the Copenhagen Free University
</I>&gt;<i> 2001/2008. Align their practice with situationist theory their aims to
</I>&gt;<i> explore different relationships to knowledge production other than
</I>&gt;<i> those posed by the knowledge economy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;We work with forms of knowledge that are fleeting, fluid,
</I>&gt;<i> schizophrenic, uncompromising, subjective, uneconomic, acapitalist,
</I>&gt;<i> produced in the kitchen, produced when asleep or arisen on a social
</I>&gt;<i> excursion &#8211; collectively.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seems to be a resurgence of popular interest in alternative
</I>&gt;<i> education. The Hayward Gallery in London recently held a symposium
</I>&gt;<i> named after Ivan Illich&#8217;s book &#8216;Deschooling Society&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is clearly a need being filled by peer based learning
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives. With a growing public engagement with the language and
</I>&gt;<i> discourse of digital media. Peer based initiatives today are aligning
</I>&gt;<i> themselves more explicitly with the sharing principles of the digital
</I>&gt;<i> commons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Art school in the Art school is a good example of this. Run out of
</I>&gt;<i> a third floor apartment in Syracuse New York -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The Art School in The Art School (The AS in The AS) seeks to generate
</I>&gt;<i> a creative and intellectual community through an open school / open
</I>&gt;<i> source structure. Through activities such as classes, discussions,
</I>&gt;<i> forming groups of interest, reading groups, critique groups,
</I>&gt;<i> workshops, eating and drinking, publishing, and making, The AS in the
</I>&gt;<i> AS seeks to create an experimental environment for shared inquiry. All
</I>&gt;<i> events are FREE and open to the public.
</I>&gt;<i> The school exists in relation (opposition, subversion, supplement,
</I>&gt;<i> mimicry) to Syracuse University&#8217;s School of Art and Design, which
</I>&gt;<i> embodies typical US art school and university educational practices.
</I>&gt;<i> The AS in The AS is a platform for self-organization: its activities
</I>&gt;<i> are generated through suggestions, proposals, conversations, and
</I>&gt;<i> finding ways to make things happen&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Requests, suggestions and proposals for classes are posted on the Art
</I>&gt;<i> Schools website. Here we see greater attention given to subjects that
</I>&gt;<i> might otherwise fall outside of the remit of conventional educational
</I>&gt;<i> practice. In addition to the art theory reading groups and avant garde
</I>&gt;<i> film screenings there are classes exploring alternative funding
</I>&gt;<i> models, barter swaps, micro lending, and discussions on student debt.
</I>&gt;<i> There&#8217;s a strong focus on electronic and digital media with classes in
</I>&gt;<i> building low power FM transmitters, introductory classes to Arduino
</I>&gt;<i> and Pure Data. The school also lends itself to a more laid back
</I>&gt;<i> treatment of taboo subjects in education hosting discussions on the
</I>&gt;<i> role of drugs and alcohol in art.
</I>&gt;<i> This fits nicely with the happy hour, art swap, beer making\bottling
</I>&gt;<i> class and the proposed procrastination class.
</I>&gt;<i> The excitement around this project is reflected in the comments people
</I>&gt;<i> have left when visiting the website and I wish it success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Art for me is all about the free and open sharing of ideas. Creating
</I>&gt;<i> spaces that nurture and support this are an essential part of this
</I>&gt;<i> process. Knowledge resources and libraries play an important role too.
</I>&gt;<i> For peer based learning networks internet is that resource. Internet
</I>&gt;<i> access liberates us from geographic and economic constraints that
</I>&gt;<i> previously limited access to public libraries and educational
</I>&gt;<i> institutions.
</I>&gt;<i> I remember trying to get my hands on a copy of Guy Debord&#8217;s film the
</I>&gt;<i> Society of the Spectacle back in 2004. You couldn&#8217;t buy a copy it had
</I>&gt;<i> been out of circulation for years. Eventually I found a really poor
</I>&gt;<i> quality .avi with english subs on an edonkey file sharing network. It
</I>&gt;<i> took forever to download. Which strangely added to my excitement.
</I>&gt;<i> Since that time there has been a surge of interest in the Situationist
</I>&gt;<i> movement accompanied by the release of a DVD box set of Debords films
</I>&gt;<i> in France in 2008. There has not yet been an official English language
</I>&gt;<i> translation or release. But many of the films are now available with
</I>&gt;<i> English srt subtitles in DVD quality on file sharing networks. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a direct connection between the resurgence of interest in the
</I>&gt;<i> work of the Situationists and the availability of those works on file
</I>&gt;<i> sharing networks? Its hard to say. But this is only one example of the
</I>&gt;<i> value of pirate libraries and networks in supporting access to out of
</I>&gt;<i> print or difficult to find creative works.
</I>&gt;<i> Creative archives and libraries such as <A HREF="http://ubu.com/">http://ubu.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://a.aaaarg.org/">http://a.aaaarg.org/</A> <A HREF="http://burundi.sk/monoskop/log/">http://burundi.sk/monoskop/log/</A> are incredible
</I>&gt;<i> resources
</I>&gt;<i> offering cash strapped students and researchers free access to a world
</I>&gt;<i> of art historical resources as well as critical texts in cultural
</I>&gt;<i> theory. An avant garde library at your fingertips. This food for
</I>&gt;<i> thought makes fertile ground for creative and critical discourse.
</I>&gt;<i> As artists its important to support and build on this.
</I>&gt;<i> Exciting times.
</I>&gt;<i>
