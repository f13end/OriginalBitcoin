<PRE>this review is rather change coming from the ultra-libertarian cato
institute, who are even more staunch defenders of the so-called 'free
market' ... I'm not aware of them ever having a focus towards civil society

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phillip Blond&#8217;s diagnosis of the pathologies of our age is as perceptive
</I>&gt;<i> and piercing as any that I have yet encountered. He follows in a long
</I>&gt;<i> tradition of independent thinkers, willing to break with &#8212; or at least to
</I>&gt;<i> bend his relationship to &#8212; party and partisans with a clear-sighted analysis
</I>&gt;<i> of the failings of the contemporary political alignments. Echoing earlier
</I>&gt;<i> analyses that call attention to the unholy alliance of State and Market such
</I>&gt;<i> as those of G.K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Wilhelm Roepke, E.M.
</I>&gt;<i> Schumacher, Russell Kirk, Robert Nisbet, Alasdair MacIntyre and Wendell
</I>&gt;<i> Berry, Blond has captured the centralizing logic of this alliance in our own
</I>&gt;<i> time with clarity and chilling insight. He calls to account the consistent
</I>&gt;<i> core of radical autonomous individualism that lies in the deepest
</I>&gt;<i> commitments of many on today&#8217;s Left and Right, noting that the seeming
</I>&gt;<i> political battles that are daily waged through shouting matches on the
</I>&gt;<i> television or in the pages of newspapers in fact obscure the deeper
</I>&gt;<i> philosophic alliance that underlies the degradation of the civic life in
</I>&gt;<i> modern nations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At base, Blond recognizes that the great error of the age lies in the
</I>&gt;<i> embrace of liberal anthropology, the theory of human nature advanced at the
</I>&gt;<i> advent of the early modern period that underlies many Left and Right
</I>&gt;<i> versions of liberty. The normative claim that human nature is to be
</I>&gt;<i> understood (through the conceit of &#8220;the State of Nature&#8221;) as consisting of
</I>&gt;<i> radically individuated selves motivated fundamentally by appetite and fear
</I>&gt;<i> is in fact based on a fundamental falsehood, essentially denying the social
</I>&gt;<i> and political nature of humans and requiring active State intervention for
</I>&gt;<i> its purported realization. In *Red Tory*, Blond writes that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> liberalism has promoted a radical individualism which, in trashing the
</I>&gt;<i> supposed despotism of custom and tradition concerning the nature of true
</I>&gt;<i> human flourishing, has produced a vacated, empty self that believes in no
</I>&gt;<i> common values or inherited creeds. But in creating this purely subjective
</I>&gt;<i> being, liberalism has also created a new and wholly terrifying tyranny. For,
</I>&gt;<i> in order to strip people of their cultural legacy and eliminate the idea
</I>&gt;<i> that people should enjoy degrees of prestige according to their nature and
</I>&gt;<i> capacity for virtue, and by making everyone instead the same sort of
</I>&gt;<i> individual with basic needs and rights, an excess of centralized authority
</I>&gt;<i> is required. The rule of the virtuous person is displaced by the explicit
</I>&gt;<i> control of the centralized state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ironically, modern forms of collectivism are the result of this radically
</I>&gt;<i> individuated theory of the human self: &#8220;the extreme individualism that
</I>&gt;<i> underpins the liberal account of human nature in the end demands
</I>&gt;<i> collectivism as a means of preserving the sanctity of the singular when
</I>&gt;<i> confronted with the reality of others.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blond recognizes that it is this liberal anthropology that underlies both
</I>&gt;<i> the Left&#8217;s infatuation with the State as an agent of liberation, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the Right&#8217;s embrace of the Market as the primary engine of human liberty.
</I>&gt;<i> While seemingly opposed, both agents are understood to derive from, and
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately support, the maintenance of the autonomous, freely willing self.
</I>&gt;<i> Both are curiously anti-social entities, relying on impersonal mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> for the supply of human goods. Both ask little of individuals by way of
</I>&gt;<i> actual concern for, or deep involvement with, the lives and fates of others.
</I>&gt;<i> Our relationships, either through the State and the Market, are rendered
</I>&gt;<i> abstract and theoretical, with each serving respectively as the impersonal
</I>&gt;<i> replacement for actual human relations and commitments. Each relieves selves
</I>&gt;<i> of the burdens and obligations of care, and instead derives from an
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of polity and society in which the self can be only truly
</I>&gt;<i> liberated when relations are rendered fungible, voluntary and contingent. To
</I>&gt;<i> resort to the taxonomy developed by Albert O. Hirschman, such anthropology
</I>&gt;<i> requires a society structured around &#8220;exit&#8221; over &#8220;loyalty,&#8221; and thus, one in
</I>&gt;<i> which &#8220;voice&#8221; is replaced by the sound of an exit door closing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In his remarks at Georgetown University, at the invitation of the program
</I>&gt;<i> that I founded and direct &#8212; The Tocqueville Forum on the Roots of American
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy &#8212; Blond briefly offered a short intellectual history of this
</I>&gt;<i> tradition, attributing the origins of this radically individuated autonomous
</I>&gt;<i> self in the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. I fear that this brief
</I>&gt;<i> synopsis of Rousseau&#8217;s argument &#8212; in which he suggested that it is
</I>&gt;<i> Rousseau&#8217;s depiction of &#8220;society [as] primordial imprisonment&#8221; that
</I>&gt;<i> underlies a libertarian-collectivist axis &#8212; provides too much comfort to
</I>&gt;<i> Anglo-American thinkers who are accustomed to thinking that the American
</I>&gt;<i> constitutional order &#8212; based in the liberal philosophy of Locke, Smith and
</I>&gt;<i> the Founding Fathers &#8212; offers a bulwark against the collectivizing spirit of
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent progressive thinkers like Rousseau, Marx, or the American
</I>&gt;<i> progressives like Croly and Dewey. A school of thought now popularized by
</I>&gt;<i> Glen Beck has arisen to explain that all of America&#8217;s woes lie in our
</I>&gt;<i> betrayal of the Founder&#8217;s Lockean vision for the Siren song of
</I>&gt;<i> Progressivism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While left underarticulated, Blond&#8217;s argument implicates the
</I>&gt;<i> anthropological assumptions of classical liberalism as well, indeed
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that there is a profound continuity between the thought of the
</I>&gt;<i> likes of Hobbes, Locke and Smith and the apparently opposite philosophies of
</I>&gt;<i> Rousseau, Marx and Dewey &#8212; and that we are now reaping the consequences this
</I>&gt;<i> combination in the unfolding events of our time. Blond&#8217;s insight is that
</I>&gt;<i> both classical liberalism &#8212; beginning with an anthropology of the radically
</I>&gt;<i> individuated self &#8212; and progressive liberalism &#8212; aspiring to the overcoming
</I>&gt;<i> of alienation that such anthropology fosters, aimed ultimately at the
</I>&gt;<i> absorption of the individuated self into a collective whole, whether as
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;species-being,&#8221; &#8220;the religion of humanity,&#8221; or &#8220;the general will&#8221; &#8212; are *
</I>&gt;<i> both* profoundly hostile to and destructive of those intermediary
</I>&gt;<i> institutions defined as &#8220;civil society.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The contemporary Right &#8212; most often the defenders of free market capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; aid and abet the destruction of civil society by advancing the liberal
</I>&gt;<i> anthropology through its individualistic economic assumptions, while the
</I>&gt;<i> contemporary Left defends radical individualism in its defense of
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; liberalism through an equally ferocious defense of individual
</I>&gt;<i> rights. In both guises, the defense of anthropological liberalism in the
</I>&gt;<i> economic or personal sphere requires a corresponding displacement of
</I>&gt;<i> inherited or cultivated loyalties and commitments to intermediary
</I>&gt;<i> commitments in the civic realm &#8212; family, neighborhood, community, Church,
</I>&gt;<i> fraternal order, guilds, unions, and so on. Both require a re-education
</I>&gt;<i> program that renders us mobile and relatively uncommitted, regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> ties of family and community as obstacles to fulfillment of the self,
</I>&gt;<i> whether economically or toward the end of &#8220;autonomy&#8221; or &#8220;self-realization.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> Both encourage the ethic of &#8220;voluntarism&#8221; and &#8220;preference neutrality,&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> defining us most fundamentally as individuated selves, and displacing the
</I>&gt;<i> central role of civil society in fostering a more expansive conception of
</I>&gt;<i> the self, one interpenetrated and defined by relationships and thereby
</I>&gt;<i> fostering an ethic of mutuality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other intellectual figure missing in (but friendly to) Blond&#8217;s account
</I>&gt;<i> is Tocqueville, who understood with prophetic clarity that this form of
</I>&gt;<i> individualism would lead not to a libertarian paradise, but a collectivist
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare. Conservatives (and libertarians) have long been sympathetic with
</I>&gt;<i> Tocqueville&#8217;s warnings about the rise of &#8220;democratic despotism&#8221; (for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, Paul Rahe&#8217;s recent book *Soft Despotism, Democracy&#8217;s Drift* is
</I>&gt;<i> the newest, post&#8211;Cold War iteration of this embrace), yet have generally
</I>&gt;<i> been remarkably willful in ignoring his explicit analysis connecting
</I>&gt;<i> individualism with collectivism. In Vol. 2, Book 4, Ch. 3 of *Democracy in
</I>&gt;<i> America*, Tocqueville wrote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As in periods of equality no man is compelled to lend his assistance to his
</I>&gt;<i> fellow men, and none has any right to expect much support from them,
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is at once independent and powerless. These two conditions, which
</I>&gt;<i> must never be either separately considered or confounded together, inspire
</I>&gt;<i> the citizen of a democratic country with very contrary propensities. His
</I>&gt;<i> independence fills him with self-reliance and pride among his equals; his
</I>&gt;<i> debility makes him feel from time to time the want of some outward
</I>&gt;<i> assistance, which he cannot expect from any of them, because they are all
</I>&gt;<i> impotent and unsympathizing. In this predicament he naturally turns his eyes
</I>&gt;<i> to that imposing power which alone rises above the level of universal
</I>&gt;<i> depression. Of that power his wants and especially his desires continually
</I>&gt;<i> remind him, until he ultimately views it as the sole and necessary support
</I>&gt;<i> of his own weakness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The contemporary conspiracy between State and Market &#8212; apparently locked in
</I>&gt;<i> battle, but more fundamentally consonant in their hostility toward, and
</I>&gt;<i> evisceration of, the institutions of civil society &#8212; mutually reinforce each
</I>&gt;<i> other, strengthening simultaneously commercial and State concentrations of
</I>&gt;<i> power that recent events reveal to have been deeply intertwined. Both are
</I>&gt;<i> based upon the radically individuated anthropology of classical liberalism,
</I>&gt;<i> an anthropology that both necessarily precedes and ultimately succors the
</I>&gt;<i> progressivist liberalism that it purports to oppose. Blond&#8217;s analysis
</I>&gt;<i> follows a line of analyses that inferred the same deeper complicity, from
</I>&gt;<i> that of Tocqueville to Bertrand de Jouvenel, from Robert Nisbet to Pierre
</I>&gt;<i> Manent. Yet, for all the insight of this piercing recognition of the deeper
</I>&gt;<i> complicity between our two &#8220;parties,&#8221; we continue to engage in the sound and
</I>&gt;<i> fury of a shadowboxing match in which the only winner is concentrated
</I>&gt;<i> economic and State power and the only loser is liberty. The only true locus
</I>&gt;<i> of human liberty is to be found in the institutions of civil society, yet
</I>&gt;<i> our dominant philosophies both regard its requirements for stability,
</I>&gt;<i> self-sacrifice and generational continuity as an obstacle to individual
</I>&gt;<i> liberty. So long as we continue to define liberty badly, we will continue to
</I>&gt;<i> lose it.
