</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Understanding Our Human Crisis
</I>&gt;<i>  To:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fellow Thinkers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is my privilege and pleasure to publish an important new work that
</I>&gt;<i> provides us with a scientific understanding of our present human crisis. I
</I>&gt;<i> had the good fortune to come across a small book called *Katrina Nights*
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Katrina-Nights-Love-Time-Flooding/dp/1449995411/">http://www.amazon.com/Katrina-Nights-Love-Time-Flooding/dp/1449995411/</A>&gt;written
</I>&gt;<i> by a young Environmental Engineer named Fouad M. Khan that was just
</I>&gt;<i> published in December 2009. This brief but complex work can be viewed as a
</I>&gt;<i> coming of age story, a stranger in a strange land tale, a terrorist
</I>&gt;<i> thriller, or simply a ribald sexual romp, and it is all of these. But woven
</I>&gt;<i> into the fabric of the larger story is an important scientific hypothesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is the brightest species on the planet in crisis? Why do our present
</I>&gt;<i> actions threaten our very future?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the author's permission, I have selected excerpts from the volume that
</I>&gt;<i> I believe best present that hypothesis. Those excerpts have been edited
</I>&gt;<i> slightly to make them more understandable since they have been lifted out of
</I>&gt;<i> the context of the novel itself. The result is the attached 28 page paper
</I>&gt;<i> excerpted from the 176 page novel. Although the book is described as a work
</I>&gt;<i> of total fiction, many of the details reported in the story ring amazingly
</I>&gt;<i> true. I suspect the story is a mixture of both truth and fiction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of the following is true. Fouad Khan was born and bred in the Islamic
</I>&gt;<i> Republic of Pakistan. He was a graduate student at the University of Houston
</I>&gt;<i> in 2005-2007. Fouad was in America on a Fulbright scholarship to pursue a
</I>&gt;<i> PhD degree in Environmental Engineering. For his thesis and research, he did
</I>&gt;<i> study the population dynamics of hydrocarbon-eating bacteria.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The story presented in the novel, describes the activities, thoughts,
</I>&gt;<i> conversations, and research of a fictional graduate student who by
</I>&gt;<i> coincidence also attends the University of Houston and is named Fouad Khan.
</I>&gt;<i> In the process of this experience, Fouad discovers what he believes is an
</I>&gt;<i> important truth about living populations. If he is correct, and I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that he is, then he has discovered the scientific basis for our present
</I>&gt;<i> human crisis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Khan tells us that exponential growth whether in bacteria or humans has a
</I>&gt;<i> major impact on the finite environment it finds it self in. This is just as
</I>&gt;<i> true for a culture of bacteria living in finite growth tank in a laboratory
</I>&gt;<i> at the University of Houston or the entire human species living on a finite
</I>&gt;<i> planet called Earth. From the attached paper, Khan writes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;There&#8217;s a fundamental assumption here, and that assumption is growth;
</I>&gt;<i> unfettered, unstoppable, unchanging, perennially beneficial growth. We
</I>&gt;<i> always start off with the unarticulated premise that bacteria populations
</I>&gt;<i> will keep on increasing exponentially, somehow effortlessly switching from
</I>&gt;<i> one food source to another without taking a hit to their growth rate. And
</I>&gt;<i> that that&#8217;s somehow good too, that that&#8217;s the ideal situation. Well, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it isn&#8217;t. &#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The change in population of a species depends on the &#8216;Adaptability&#8217; of the
</I>&gt;<i> species. &#8216;Adaptability&#8217; can be defined as the ability of the species&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> population to cope with the &#8216;Rate of Change of Entropy&#8217; of its host system.
</I>&gt;<i> Think of it this way, when I add one liter of hydrochloric acid to my tank
</I>&gt;<i> of bacteria, &#8230; the population immediately dies off, the change in entropy of
</I>&gt;<i> the system is too fast, the RATE OF CHANGE OF ENTROPY is too high, the
</I>&gt;<i> populations can&#8217;t cope with it. But if I keep adding the same hydrochloric
</I>&gt;<i> one drop at a time over a period of sixty days, the bacteria survive, they
</I>&gt;<i> adapt, their adaptive capacity is capable of handling this *rate of change
</I>&gt;<i> of entropy*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;In other words, give the process of evolution, nothing is poisonous per se
</I>&gt;<i> for bacteria or any other living population, it is the speed at which that
</I>&gt;<i> pollutant is added to the host system that makes the pollutant poisonous.
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto for change in the other environmental conditions.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Khan has discovered that exponential growth increases the *rate of change
</I>&gt;<i> of entropy***, and is a critical factor leading to crisis. Khan continues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Now, the curious case of the exponential growth curve. The exponential
</I>&gt;<i> growth curve is stuck upon because the bacteria have suddenly discovered a
</I>&gt;<i> higher system. In other words when I introduce benzene in my tank of
</I>&gt;<i> bacteria population, I am introducing an additional resource to the system.
</I>&gt;<i> When bacteria discover this concentration of benzene and discover how to
</I>&gt;<i> consume it, they&#8217;ve essentially jumped from their lower system of no benzene
</I>&gt;<i> to a higher system which contains benzene in it. The higher system is more
</I>&gt;<i> expansive and has a better capacity to absorb entropy. So the sudden change
</I>&gt;<i> in entropy caused by sudden microorganism population rise does not have an
</I>&gt;<i> effect on the RATE OF CHANGE OF ENTROPY, though it does add a bit to the
</I>&gt;<i> entropy of the system. We must understand that the inherent *rate of
</I>&gt;<i> change of entropy* is a primary characteristic of a system and once that
</I>&gt;<i> is changed, the system definition is fundamentally altered, leaving the
</I>&gt;<i> system either adaptable or inadaptable for a inhabiting living species
</I>&gt;<i> population. The &#8216;adaptability&#8217; of the species must now be measured against
</I>&gt;<i> the new *rate of change of entropy*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;But what happens when a species discovers a higher system and hits an
</I>&gt;<i> exponential growth curve. I believe that there are fundamental behavioral
</I>&gt;<i> alterations at the individual species level which reflect in the change of
</I>&gt;<i> rate of population growth. Something in the species&#8217; very genetic makeup,
</I>&gt;<i> some evolutionary trigger is pushed which reduces the species to an all
</I>&gt;<i> consuming, all reproducing machine. Some switch which previously moderated
</I>&gt;<i> the species consumption of resources is turned off&#8230; for good. I found out
</I>&gt;<i> that for bacteria, the consumption footprint of hydrocarbons increased
</I>&gt;<i> between three to five folds as the population hit the exponential growth
</I>&gt;<i> curve. The bacteria started eating and reproducing like maniacs. They ate so
</I>&gt;<i> much and so fast, they ate themselves into oblivion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;You see with the exponential growth curve, the entropic footprint of the
</I>&gt;<i> species also increases very rapidly. Initially the bacteria or the species
</I>&gt;<i> is just another part of the system, contributing its set share to the
</I>&gt;<i> overall rate of change of entropy of the system. Adding to entropy but not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to affect the *rate of change*; at this point the species
</I>&gt;<i> population exists in harmony with the system. When a higher system is
</I>&gt;<i> discovered such as through addition of benzene to the tank, there&#8217;s now room
</I>&gt;<i> for bacteria to consume more and grow without affecting the already altered
</I>&gt;<i> rate of change of entropy of the system positively, so the bacteria grow
</I>&gt;<i> exponentially. But if the exponential growth continues soon a point arrives
</I>&gt;<i> where the entropic footprint of the species is so high that it is higher
</I>&gt;<i> than the entropic footprint of all the other components of the system put
</I>&gt;<i> together. At this point the species starts to add to the *rate of change
</I>&gt;<i> of entropy* of the system itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Now if we recall, we&#8217;d defined the adaptability of the system as nothing
</I>&gt;<i> more than its populations&#8217; ability to cope with the *rate of change of
</I>&gt;<i> entropy* of the system. When a species starts to add to the very *rate of
</I>&gt;<i> change of entropy* of its host system and enters what I have decided to
</I>&gt;<i> call hyper-entropic growth phase, it has essentially started to make its
</I>&gt;<i> host system uninhabitable and inadaptable for itself. It has essentially
</I>&gt;<i> started to commit mass suicide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The system becoming uninhabitable for the species is from there, only a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of time. Once the *rate of change of entropy* of the system has
</I>&gt;<i> risen too high for the species&#8217; population to adapt to, basically due to the
</I>&gt;<i> species own insatiable appetite, the population enters the death phase,
</I>&gt;<i> after a very pointed peak or stationary phase. The more obtuse the rise in
</I>&gt;<i> population, the faster the exponential growth, the smaller the length of
</I>&gt;<i> stationary phase. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I think we humans discovered a higher system when we discovered fossil
</I>&gt;<i> fuel as an industrial resource, a source of cheap energy. Hydrocarbons were
</I>&gt;<i> our dope, curiously not unlike those of the bacteria I grow in lab. We hit
</I>&gt;<i> exponential growth curve when we found oil. I believe human beings entered
</I>&gt;<i> the hyper-entropic growth phase somewhere in the mid to early nineteen
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds. We started affecting the entropy of our host system, Earth in a
</I>&gt;<i> big way around that time making it essentially inhospitable for us. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe global warming is one of the physical manifestations of the growing
</I>&gt;<i> inadaptability of our host system for us.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, we humans are much more powerful than the bacteria in Khan's
</I>&gt;<i> tanks. Plants and animals can only survive by adapting to their environment.
</I>&gt;<i> If the rate of change of their entropy is slow enough they can adapt to
</I>&gt;<i> anything. Humans have the animal body so we can also adapt to anything in
</I>&gt;<i> our environment if the rate of change is slow enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, we have an advantage not available to the plants and animals. We
</I>&gt;<i> have the human mind which can understand and invent technology to adapt the
</I>&gt;<i> environment to us. Human technology allows us to survive underwater without
</I>&gt;<i> gills, it allows us to travel through the vacuum of space, and romp on the
</I>&gt;<i> moon, a planet without air. We do this by adapting the environment to us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while the plants and animals have only one strategy, we humans have two.
</I>&gt;<i> But this makes our situation no less precarious, it just gives us more
</I>&gt;<i> options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Khan has discovered that *exponential growth* always increases the *rate
</I>&gt;<i> of change of entropy***, and this  explains our present *Human Crisis*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the only way for us to avoid extinction is to change our behavior. We
</I>&gt;<i> must reduce our population. Ideally, going forward each of us would
</I>&gt;<i> voluntarily have only one child. One child per couple. This would bring our
</I>&gt;<i> population down rapidly without injury to anyone. We must simultaneously
</I>&gt;<i> reduce our use of fossil fuels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just as the bacteria in a culture can adapt to hydrochloric acid if it is
</I>&gt;<i> added a little at a time. The bacteria in the same culture could also adapt
</I>&gt;<i> to the loss of Benzene if it was removed a little at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today humanity is consuming ~85 million barrels of petroleum every day.
</I>&gt;<i> Reduce that to zero tomorrow and most of us would die. Reduce that by 5
</I>&gt;<i> million barrels every year, and in ten years our use would be reduced to ~35
</I>&gt;<i> million barrels a day, we could adapt to this change without too much
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty. It would only require that we work together in a more
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent and efficient way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our exponential growth does not have to be the end of our human species,
</I>&gt;<i> but it certainly will be unless we change our ways. This could be our final
</I>&gt;<i> human crisis if politics and business continue as usual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Crisis is always the harbinger of an overwhelming problem. Fortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> crisis has two components&#8212;Danger and Opportunity. When faced with crisis,
</I>&gt;<i> there is almost always a window of opportunity, when intelligent action can
</I>&gt;<i> avert most or at least some of the danger of the crisis. But, that
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity is fleeting. The only rational response is Carpe diem&#8212;Seize the
</I>&gt;<i> Day. We must recognize the opportunity in time and then act quickly and
</I>&gt;<i> intelligently.
