<PRE>Speaking for Dadamac and ways of learning - I relate positively to the
learn-as-needed &quot;stealth curriculum&quot; (rather than any tradiitonal &quot;set
curriculum&quot;).

As for the &quot;problems&quot; we are trying to solve, well, that depends on what
problems currently need to be faced by people, and which of those problems
require some &quot;learning&quot;.

By &quot;people&quot; I usually mean people at Fantsuam, represented by John Dada, but
we do connect with people/communities in other locations too.

The range of problems in a community is as wide as the range of problems in
a family - ie from birth to death and everything in between. This short
video from my colleague John Dada in his (voluntary) role at Fantsuam
Foundation may help to put that wide statement into some kind of context
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=zlEBTCZ67NI.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=zlEBTCZ67NI.</A>

This earlier post to peer to peer
<A HREF="http://dadamac.posterous.com/p2p-research-fwd-call-for-papers-on-networkedmay">http://dadamac.posterous.com/p2p-research-fwd-call-for-papers-on-networkedmay</A>
also help to illustrate the kind of learning that I mean.

Regarding &quot; Where are the intersections of real, actual trust now? And,
where is the fertile ground from which new trust can grow?&quot;

Dadamac has strong trust between John Dada and me - which gives excellent
UK-Nigeria trust and cross cultural collaboration. John has a huge
high-trust network on the ground in and around Fantsuam and in much wider
pan African and international networks. My trust networks are a mixture of
online contacts (developed through nearly ten years of activity online) plus
F2F contacts mostly in Nigeria, Kenya and London.

It is hard to label my networks - but I suppose that some of my trust
intersections in London are with academics, some with entrepreneurs, some
with social (or social media) activists.  They all tend to be people who are
also active online.

Our online high trust is person to person (I guess that is the only kind of
trust there is) - which includes various organisations through the people
behind these organisations, such as Kabissa <A HREF="http://kabissa.org/">http://kabissa.org/</A> and
Peoples-Uni <A HREF="http://www.peoples-uni.org/">http://www.peoples-uni.org/</A> and the ICT4D Collective
<A HREF="http://www.ict4d.org.uk/.">http://www.ict4d.org.uk/.</A>

I was fortunate enough to be included in Franz's workshop in Vienna in
January, where he did a grand job of building relationships of trust between
the participants. In fact one of the participants commented that Franz had
created a community, and that afterwards we should create a &quot;community of
our communities&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an important call and message from franz naharada:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats exactly what our focus must be in the coming months and years.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Collective self-education as the center of transformation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats why I also think teaming up with Global Innovation Commons is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utterly important.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We must vigorously ask for the creation of a p2p education and knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer system that is focussed on local resilience and practical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capabilities. We must do everything to link up with Transition Towns,
</I>&gt;<i> Gaia
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; University, P2PU and likeminded institutions and motivate those networks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to reach out even more to local cores of community building that result
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building, doing, making - at high quality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We must participate in larger efforts to phrase and distill the global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; importance of every local community experience and feed it back into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; living body of experience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is why I think VideoBridge is an important piece in the puzle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your upcoming trip to Italy and the meeting with Negri and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multipliers is a unique opportunity to deepen the understanding that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *attention has to be decoupled from the temporary and spectacular* and
</I>&gt;<i> *it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be focussed on the reality of &quot;bringing the mind home&quot; into our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyday world* and thus lead to real connectedness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see the ''piazza telematica'' idea refer and resonate with education
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; productive capacities, and in my view the conditions are super - ripe ;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially in italy  ; to lay out a more concrete vision of community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; empowerment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tooled for some time on the technological side (Videobridging) and we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are still struggling to create our collaboration rooms that really enable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us to combine global cooperation with local impact. Giuseppe is one of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VideoBridgers and I hope he will come up with community based solutions
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Italy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some blanket assertions I am going to lay down here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. As a person deeply steeped in the development of technology of all
</I>&gt;<i> types on a daily basis:  technology will succeed when it has an
</I>&gt;<i> architecture that affords it's employment in problems people care
</I>&gt;<i> about solving. So, all of the groups Franz mentions above could start
</I>&gt;<i> out by asking &quot;what are the problems the communities we are connected
</I>&gt;<i> with trying to solve?&quot; to people in communities, and pooling their
</I>&gt;<i> resources into creating an architecture that is designed for
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability first, and in which development is driven by people
</I>&gt;<i> it serves. Otherwise, *access* to technology in ways that are useful
</I>&gt;<i> for many people will always remain out of reach of many (even when it
</I>&gt;<i> is freely available).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. These systems must have *embedded* education. My friend Ross
</I>&gt;<i> MacDonald says it best (quoting his entire post here):
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pragmatics of knowledge transfer for business and business cluster
</I>&gt;<i> development:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What does the curriculum look like?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. How does it work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. What are some example topics?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As noted in an earlier post, the educational objective for supporting
</I>&gt;<i> business growth is to expand the collaborative communication skills of
</I>&gt;<i> emerging groups by developing a set of appropriately timed learning
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities, structured as a flexible framework and delivered on a
</I>&gt;<i> group-by-group basis. Four values guide knowledge transfer activities:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) learner-centered, (2) adapted to specific groups, (3) timed for
</I>&gt;<i> maximum receptivity and benefit, and (4) makes best use of real
</I>&gt;<i> examples and cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this post I address the three pragmatic questions above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What does the curriculum look like?
</I>&gt;<i> Actually it is a &quot;stealth curriculum,&quot; meaning that, in the ideal, the
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge transfer is indistinguishable from the activities of people
</I>&gt;<i> who are building business clusters. This is not a &quot;learn now, apply
</I>&gt;<i> later&quot; approach. Instead it is a &quot;do now and here's some tools to
</I>&gt;<i> help&quot; approach.  The rationale: learning is best delivered when people
</I>&gt;<i> reach out for the learning and pull it in.  When learning is pushed
</I>&gt;<i> onto people, they tend to resist.  Thus, the curriculum is a set of
</I>&gt;<i> evolving and easily adapted modules.  Moreover, each module provides
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge about tools and processes delivered on an as needed basis.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, tasks and content particular to the group will be inserted
</I>&gt;<i> into each module. By timing the delivery and ensuring its relevance to
</I>&gt;<i> suit group needs, learning happens in the process of doing business: a
</I>&gt;<i> stealth curriculum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. How does it work?
</I>&gt;<i> The short answer is in recurring but progressive loops.  Here's what
</I>&gt;<i> that means.  Think cycles.  Each time knowledge is stealthily
</I>&gt;<i> transferred, it progresses through these functions: design, deliver,
</I>&gt;<i> feedback and adapt.  These four steps comprise one cycle and ensure
</I>&gt;<i> that the knowledge transfer process continues to evolve, improve, and
</I>&gt;<i> remain relevant. In addition, testimonials, examples, and stories will
</I>&gt;<i> be collected and fed back into the modules.  The examples illustrate
</I>&gt;<i> tools and their applications and so should also stimulate confidence
</I>&gt;<i> and creativity.  The curriculum therefore enhances the sustainability
</I>&gt;<i> of businesses and business ecosystems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. What are some example topics?
</I>&gt;<i> Example topics include: techniques for sharing documents and plans
</I>&gt;<i> especially in regard to business case and business ecosystem
</I>&gt;<i> development, tracking group progress, identifying and overcoming
</I>&gt;<i> obstacles to group progress, creating productive linkages with local
</I>&gt;<i> schools, and enhancing student-community connections. This list is
</I>&gt;<i> illustrative, not comprehensive.  While we can anticipate some
</I>&gt;<i> particular needs and so prepare in advance for them, there will be
</I>&gt;<i> other needs that we can't anticipate at this point, but that will
</I>&gt;<i> require a module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Knowledge transfer is critical for our vision of a set of &quot;business
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystems,&quot;  which refers to a network of related businesses that
</I>&gt;<i> work together to strengthen each business and enhance their
</I>&gt;<i> collaborations, and so that, as a cluster, they become sustainable and
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly powerful economic engines in their respective locales.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above is an example of education embedded into actual activities.
</I>&gt;<i> The above project is funded by grants from governments and private
</I>&gt;<i> institutions. So, this effectively means in reality that access and
</I>&gt;<i> politics of control in this project are not accessible to everyone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In P2P Education suggested by Franz, Michel, Daniel Araya and others,
</I>&gt;<i> we can go even further than what Ross writes about above. The idea of
</I>&gt;<i> embedding education and literacies is as described by Ross above is
</I>&gt;<i> right. However, in P2P systems, we can create relationships of
</I>&gt;<i> resource sharing and pooling, and systems of decision making that
</I>&gt;<i> remove hierarchical control of the development of these resources
</I>&gt;<i> (both technological and educational).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the coming months, Future Forward Institute/Forward Foundation are
</I>&gt;<i> going to work with Michel Bauwens and P2P Foundation to create a
</I>&gt;<i> system of proposal, needs assessment/evaluation, collective decision
</I>&gt;<i> making, collective funding/contributing for building of p2p
</I>&gt;<i> technology, literacies, resources. This is a large undertaking and
</I>&gt;<i> will take some time to fully develop. Are we  truly *ready* to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in such a system, where control is collaborative and
</I>&gt;<i> non-centralized?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, if we are to create working relationships among all of the
</I>&gt;<i> various groups and people now loosely stitched together, we need to
</I>&gt;<i> ask the really hard questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Where are the intersections of real, actual trust now? And, where is
</I>&gt;<i> the fertile ground from which new trust can grow?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - What is the purpose, the end goal of collaboration? What is it that
</I>&gt;<i> *we* (not you or me) want to accomplish?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Assuming we can get that far, how do we as the &quot;experts&quot; work
</I>&gt;<i> together to clear paths and get out of the way so that the multitudes
</I>&gt;<i> of others currently shut out of access can move forward with solving
</I>&gt;<i> their problems of existence? How can we involve people who now don't
</I>&gt;<i> have the slightest clue as to what any of us are talking about? Those
</I>&gt;<i> people outnumber us exponentially. We have very few ways to listen to
</I>&gt;<i> them now.
