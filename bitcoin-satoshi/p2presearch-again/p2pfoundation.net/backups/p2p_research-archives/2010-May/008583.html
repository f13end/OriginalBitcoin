&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently published the blog post I mentioned in the recent
</I>&gt;<i> discussion below, and left a comment on the P2P blog (see below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be really interested in what people on this list think about the
</I>&gt;<i> future of P2P in a near-term scenario of energy depletion. While I am
</I>&gt;<i> hugely supportive of P2P values and approaches, I do worry that while
</I>&gt;<i> still in their embryonic forms, a global Peak Oil scenario will do
</I>&gt;<i> serious damage to the gains that have already been made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you can offer potential opportunities for P2P in such a
</I>&gt;<i> scenario? Simply, I see a future of greater social unrest and struggle,
</I>&gt;<i> which may offer revolutionary opportunities, which P2P can harness in
</I>&gt;<i> some way. I should add that I don't view myself as a 'doomer' nor do I
</I>&gt;<i> advocate a survivalist mentality in such a scenario, yet having
</I>&gt;<i> researched this area quite closely for several months now, I am finding
</I>&gt;<i> it hard to be optimistic for a net culture that draws on such huge
</I>&gt;<i> energy resources, not just in sourcing electricity, but in the
</I>&gt;<i> manufacture of hardware in which much of the embodied energy of the net
</I>&gt;<i> lies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problems I see are a combination of technical, temporal, economic
</I>&gt;<i> and social.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technical, because we do not have replacement technologies that can be
</I>&gt;<i> deployed on the required scale to smoothly transition to a post-oil world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Temporal, because by all accounts, the period required to transition to
</I>&gt;<i> a post-oil world is measured in decades, even with intense and
</I>&gt;<i> co-ordinated effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Economic, because our model of growth is tied to our production of
</I>&gt;<i> energy. I think that while in its embryonic form, P2P is still reliant
</I>&gt;<i> on a model of growth to maintain the infrastructure required to support
</I>&gt;<i> and spread the values of P2P and develop non-net-based forms of P2P.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Social, because unplanned de-growth and the development and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of alternative technologies on the scale required, to
</I>&gt;<i> combat the negative consequences of both Peak Oil and Climate Change,
</I>&gt;<i> arguably requires countries to be on 'a war footing', with intense,
</I>&gt;<i> co-ordinated and sustained national effort. During WWII, the UK
</I>&gt;<i> mobilised half of national productivity towards the single goal of
</I>&gt;<i> winning the war. Is that possible today? What are the policy implications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say a little more about that here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2010/04/23/climate-change-and-the-language-of-war/">http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2010/04/23/climate-change-and-the-language-of-war/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, here's the comment I made on the P2P blog:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/time-scales-for-p2p-oriented-change-the-2030-scenario/2010/05/09">http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/time-scales-for-p2p-oriented-change-the-2030-scenario/2010/05/09</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently summarised six recent publications that provide an
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date overview of the social and technological challenges of Peak
</I>&gt;<i> Oil and Climate Change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2010/05/13/peak-oil-and-climate-change-notes/">http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2010/05/13/peak-oil-and-climate-change-notes/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I worry that Peak Oil has serious implications for the development of a
</I>&gt;<i> P2P culture which, in its current embryonic form, remains largely
</I>&gt;<i> reliant on cheap energy, globalisation and economic growth, all of which
</I>&gt;<i> are threatened by dwindling oil supplies over the next decade. As liquid
</I>&gt;<i> fuels become more expensive and difficult to source, economies will
</I>&gt;<i> experience zero or degrowth, providing opportunities for more
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian modes of government that emphasise the need for
</I>&gt;<i> 'stability' and 'efficiency'. I also fear that Net access is similarly
</I>&gt;<i> likely to peak over the next decade and then decline as it becomes too
</I>&gt;<i> expensive to maintain the current infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, if governments decide to seriously tackle climate change,
</I>&gt;<i> it will require the full resources of developed countries, much like
</I>&gt;<i> when in a national state of war, again providing further opportunities
</I>&gt;<i> for greater authoritarianism, in contrast to the distributed, autonomous
</I>&gt;<i> sites of P2P production.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I am still inclined to think that long-term, a P2P
</I>&gt;<i> commons-based culture can still thrive, I think we face decades of
</I>&gt;<i> struggle during a difficult transition to alternative forms of less
</I>&gt;<i> intensive sources of energy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The growing consensus is that the peak of conventional oil was in 2005
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that the peak of all liquid fuels will be between 2010 - 2014.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've summarised this and a few other things relating to climate,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology and efficiency, here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since writing that, a paper from an Oxford University research group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (including ex-Chief Scientific Advisor to UK gov, Sr. David King) has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; added to the growing Peak Oil consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2010.02.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2010.02.026</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got a blog post half-drafted on this paper. Here's the summary I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give for it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ---
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Owen, Inderwildi and King&#8217;s recent paper, The status of conventional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world oil reserves&#8212;Hype or cause for concern?, supports previous studies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by others which show that conventional oil production peaked in 2005 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the peak production capacity of all liquids (excluding gas), will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peak around 2010. Conventional oil supply is declining by over 4%/annum,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the shortfall and anticipated additional demand being met by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-conventional oil (deep sea, tar sands) and other liquid sources such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as gas and bio-fuels. In just ten years, 50% of the global demand for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; liquid fuel will have to be met by sources that are not in production
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; today. Not surprisingly then, speculation over the price of oil based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fundamental supply and demand factors, as well as global events such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the invasion of Iraq, Hurricane Katrina and Israel threatening to attack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Iran, has resulted in increased volatility of prices, reaching a high of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $147 a barrel in July 2008. In 2000, a barrel of oil cost around $20. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decade later, the price of oil is around $80 a barrel and the trend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remains upwards.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Different economic theories applied to the supply and demand of oil
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offer opposite outcomes. One suggests that the law of diminishing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returns would create an incentive to invest further in unconventional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sources such as tar sands and deep sea resources. On the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some economists argue that due to the inextricable link between oil and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economic activity, high oil prices can&#8217;t be sustained and that a price
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of $100 a barrel would induce global recession, driving down oil prices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and paradoxically reducing investment in alternative fuels. While rising
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; oil prices can damage economic growth, lowering oil prices do not have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same, proportionate effect on stimulating growth. It has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; estimated that oil price-GDP elasticity is -0.055 (+/- 0.005) meaning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that a 10% rise in oil prices leads to a 0.55% loss in global GDP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Owen, Inderwildi and King&#8217;s paper concludes that published world oil
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reserve estimates are inaccurate and should be revised downwards by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; third. Over-reporting since the 1980s due to the &#8216;fight for quotas&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whereby OPEC agreed to set export quotas in proportion to reserve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; volumes, and the inclusion of tar-sands into reserve estimates since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2004 have distorted reality. They add that &#8220;supply and demand is likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to diverge between 2010 and 2015, unless demand falls in parallel with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supply constrained induced recession&#8221; and that &#8220;the capacity to meet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; liquid fuel demand is contingent upon the rapid and immediate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; diversification of the liquid fuel mix, the transition to alternative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; energy carriers where appropriate, and demand side measures such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavioural change and adaptation.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ----
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't otherwise disagree with the 2030 scenario you outline below.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Joss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; speed up of Arctic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and Antarctic thaw right now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100404/sc_nm/us_climate_nitrous">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100404/sc_nm/us_climate_nitrous</A>  by 2030
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it is plausible that we will have already passed the tipping point for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affecting climates world wide.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Food and energy demand are projected to increase by 50% by 2030, fresh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; water by 30%
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/5967/812">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/5967/812</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  India and China (2 most populous nations) both warn their populations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that their demand will outstrip their supplies severely by 2030
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_crisis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_crisis</A>  (links there to reports on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this subject)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Many food producing corporations that run industrial farming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; operations are switching large scale agricultural production to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; biofuel
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2009/10/12/118291/Massive-increase-in-global-biofuel-production.htm">http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2009/10/12/118291/Massive-increase-in-global-biofuel-production.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  which can further increase food costs by raising commodity prices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; worldwide, and causing food shortages. This price and biofuel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; production increase is already happening now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, multiple corporations are relentlessly pursuing total
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; control of communications infrastructure, (and already have total
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; control of) financial systems, energy and food distribution, etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So, by 2030 (not later) it is plausible that we will already be in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; state where millions, if not billions will be marginalized by all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; existing basic sustenance systems (food, water, energy, access).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Stuart Kauffman, and other complex systems theorists have shown that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in all systems, change tends to happen in an &quot;s curve&quot; fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Kauffman uses a sandpile as an example in his book &quot;At Home In The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Universe&quot;. He describes the data signature of a massive pile of sand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; collapsing. First small bits fall of, then large chunks, then larger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and larger, faster and faster. The total rate of collapse towards the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; end is exponentially faster than the beginning. I think we are seeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the same with global human systems now, and that we are *now* in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; beginning time of collapse, with signals already present around the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; world. This means we have maybe 15 years, starting *now*, to start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; changing things in significant ways for at least 45% or more of people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on the earth. 45% minimum probably will get us enough inertia in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opposite direction to slow down the momentum that is starting *now*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is what I think.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
