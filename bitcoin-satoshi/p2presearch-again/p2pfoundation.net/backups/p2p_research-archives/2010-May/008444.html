Dear Michel and p2p enthusiasts,

When I see the current discussions around p2p concepts and our societies,
there is always a common requirement that would allow more p2p activities
between citizen : this requirement is the autonomy of each element in a
p2p networks (in our societies or in the non-physical world).

To be autonomous, you need two important concepts:

- (1) The ability to control your tools to be autonomous and
- (2) also getting the benefit of running autonomous.

(1) is what's called by Ivan Illich the &quot;tools for conviviality&quot;[1] where he was
already making a definition of free software[2] in the seventies. Everyone
must have the control on their tools (e.g. technologies, information
tools,...) and
be able to use them without the need of a monopoly.

&quot;A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the
most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others.&quot;

(2) is self explanatory, if you can't get a benefit/reward (either
direct or indirect),
the incentive to be autonomous is very low.

Looking at the past discussions, it seems sometimes that we could
be afraid to jump into a &quot;DoOcracy&quot;[3] because some risks exists but
I think the risk is higher to give up and ask &quot;large organization&quot; to do
the next tools for the next years. We will then loose the control of the tools
and won't be able to be autonomous.

That's why when doing something to render people (and/or machine)
more independant, we need to keep in mind (IMHO) that the system
must be simple and convivial for everyone willing to use or modify it.

Just a small comment,

Thanks to all for your work.
