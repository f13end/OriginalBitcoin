<PRE>Hi Franz and everyone.

I have highlighted the parts of Franz's email below to show the parts that I
respond to in my heart and mind, and would like to discuss in depth at some
point - in general and specific ways. (apologies if this is a list where I
should only use the simplest kind of text and should not have used
highlighting)

For now, regarding a detailed response I simply flag up some related
specific examples to support what Franz is suggesting.

Ref &quot;every local community experience and feed it back into a
living body of experience&quot;  and &quot; Lampao village....too dry.... solar driven
pump; a solar collector should turn solar energy into mechanical energy....
That mechanical energy should drive the pump. or if there
are some niftier connections between the thermal and the flow side, find
out about them.&quot;

Such information would be relevant and valuable for Attachab eco-village
<A HREF="http://www.dadamac.net/projects/attachab">http://www.dadamac.net/projects/attachab</A>

The land is bordered by a river. They have a long dry season and would
welcome knowing more about good practice for irrigation using solar energy -
if it was practical and affordable.

I also note the reference to studying fishery. The team at Attachab have
experimented with fish farming. Their experiments included making temporary
ponds which used the water from the river during the dry season - knowing
that when the rainy season came the walls of the ponds would be washed away.
Their previous ponds were unsuccessful because there was not a sufficient
flow of water through them. My impression is that solar energy is not
appropriate for pumping water on the scale that would be needed to have
successful pond on higher ground fed from the water supply of the river. If
progress is made in this respect we would love to know about it - even if it
is just for some irrigation, and not for the fish ponds.

Ref &quot;This link between virtual and physical community is in a nutshell the
core
of the educational system that we need&quot;

I agree completely - or at least I do if I have understood Franz's meaning
correctly. I understand him to mean a new kind of collaborative approach to
learning that is enabled through a virtual community, but is also very real
in a local sense. We have been talking our own small steps towards this
through our &quot;First Thursday&quot; chats and similar online exchanges of
information.

Recent examples are biomass stoves:

<A HREF="http://dadamac.posterous.com/topic-thursday-bucket-stoves-with-chat-archiv">http://dadamac.posterous.com/topic-thursday-bucket-stoves-with-chat-archiv</A>

and using twitter (how and why - to help people in our virtual community to
connect more easily with each other online - and with other people):

<A HREF="http://dadamac.posterous.com/dadamac-tweeters-session">http://dadamac.posterous.com/dadamac-tweeters-session</A>

I am not able to follow all that goes on in P2P - but I hope I manage to
keep up with this thread.

an important call and message from franz naharada:


I just peeked into the latest p2p digest and found these VERY wise words
by Daniel Araya
&quot;Can stigmergic innovation replace corporations and property-based
capitalism? I would say yes possibly: If the innovation cycle is faster
and of higher quality. In the meantime I see corporations developing
platforms for collaborative innovation as the next wave of capitalism. P2P
may ultimately replace this (I add: abusive scheme of)
crowdsourcing/user-innovation but I would still argue that none of this
will happen without a cultural project focused on transmitting skills and
ideas. In other words, education... &quot;
Thats exactly what our focus must be in the coming months and years.
Collective self-education as the center of transformation.
Thats why I also think teaming up with Global Innovation Commons is
utterly important.
We must vigorously ask for the creation of a p2p education and knowledge
transfer system that is focussed on local resilience and practical
capabilities. We must do everything to link up with Transition Towns, Gaia
University, P2PU and likeminded institutions and motivate those networks
to reach out even more to local cores of community building that result in
building, doing, making - at high quality.
We must participate in larger efforts to phrase and distill the global
importance of every local community experience and feed it back into a
living body of experience.
That is why I think VideoBridge is an important piece in the puzle.
Your upcoming trip to Italy and the meeting with Negri and other
multipliers is a unique opportunity to deepen the understanding that
*attention has to be decoupled from the temporary and spectacular* and *it
should be focussed on the reality of &quot;bringing the mind home&quot; into our
everyday world* and thus lead to real connectedness.
I see the ''piazza telematica'' idea refer and resonate with education and
productive capacities, and in my view the conditions are super - ripe ;
especially in italy  ; to lay out a more concrete vision of community
empowerment.
I tooled for some time on the technological side (Videobridging) and we
are still struggling to create our collaboration rooms that really enable
us to combine global cooperation with local impact. Giuseppe is one of the
VideoBridgers and I hope he will come up with community based solutions in
Italy.
Video is one indispensible factor of this. But also design languages and
common standards, and last but not least also a repository of stuff.
(hence my emphasis on Global Innovation Commons)
How will we bring this all together?
a very small - seemingly unsignificant - example comes to my mind:
One of our people who work in the village of Kirchbach
(<A HREF="http://listcultures.org/mailman/listinfo/p2presearch_listcultures.org">franz.rieger at hotmail.com</A> ) is currently in Thailand. Its a really good
example also in relation to your red shirt stories - a very poor area
named Isaan.  He has been there for three months, helping in the
development of the so called Lampao village. He is supporting a family
there since years - pays for the tuition and living costs of 2 sons, one
of them in Chiang Mai studying fishery by the way ;-)
So here they are. A poor Village of (90%) rice farmers, and the rice field
is too dry, and there is only one harvest per year possible. Education is
very poor there, the agricultural equipment is old, the soil is sandy and
dry, as is the climate outside the rain season. On the other side there is
a giant artificial lake nearby, but it is located deeper than the rice
fields of this particular village. So they came up with the idea of a
solar driven pump; a solar collector should turn solar energy into
mechanical energy (something that Juergen Kleinwaechter has already done
with Sun Pulse). That mechanical energy should drive the pump. or if there
are some niftier connections between the thermal and the flow side, find
out about them.
Kirchbach is the village where VideoBridging originated. Its great that
people from there are engaging in global projects. It would be wonderful
if there would be opportunities to link up individuals and groups all over
the world in Videobridge centers to start synchronous telecooperation to
solve everyday problems and empower people to deal with efficient
technologies. Or even better, use the visual medium to clearly capture
present and demonstrate problematiques and apply and comment on these
visuals in video conversations.
I encouraged Franz Rieger to address you in this context.
This link between virtual and physical community is in a nutshell the core
of the educational system that we need. We must start talking about it,
and see who will be there to build it. We should at least be part of that
effort.

That is why I thought  a good step could be made in Italy. I have not
heard from &quot;my&quot; (VideoBridge) people in Greece either recently. But maybe
we could really bring up the issue simultaneously in several countries and
use the momentum wherever we are in the moment.

 I suggest you forward the following to your convenience:
